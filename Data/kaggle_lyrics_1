3581,"Stranded in the storm trying to see through the rain
Looks like my life's coming 'round again
I wouldn't stop it now even if I thought I could
I was one of the remnants from a burned out scene
Trying to recover from the years between
What they didn't want then is what they think they want now

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

I'd been pickin' up the pieces from another hard fall
Waitin' by the phone for an overseas call
They wanted my past and they wanted it now
I could sense it in the air, feel it in my veins
Something was coming to take me away
I'd been lost for so long, maybe it's the price we all pay

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

I looked in the mirror trying to see
What it was they had killed in me
And why can't I no longer believe
I wandered around and I swore by God
I would never give in no matter how hard they fought
I've waited too long to have it any other way

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago"

And never let go

I call you from my hotel room
I'm sitting on the hallway floor
I know that we are so so so
So tired my phone card just expired

You only call me when you're drunk
I can tell it by your voice
It's the only time that you
Open up to me and tell me that you love me

Is throw my arms around you

In my dreams

You were bathed in blue light
Floating right in front of me
Your face was so so so
So bright I had to close my eyes to see

The first thing that I do
Is throw my arms around you

And time is just a hunger
It bleeds us out to nothing

I hope we'll float away together

Leaves every child a bastard
When it finally takes us over
I hope we'll float away together

And as the night is falling
I find that I'm recalling
That blissful all-enthralling day.

Beside the bay.
And I sailed away.
I dream of her in Avalon
From dusk till dawn.
So I think I'll travel on
To Avalon."

Your love is real.
Near you I want to be.

The banjo's strumming soft and low.
I know that you 
Yearn for me too.
Swannee, you're calling me.

Swanee, how I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee.
I give the world to be
Among the folks in D-I-X-I-
Even though my mammy's
Waiting for me,
Praying for me
Down by the Swanee.
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore.

Blue lights on the runway

With that great big stick of hers
Kinda looks like an oar

The accountants have taken the movie
Yeah, they?re on set
The people from the mobile phone company
Say who gets to play and who gets to not

You?re a picture of the check out girl
Hand me a plastic bag
I got the sweats trying to open it
As it all piles up, I wish I didn?t bite my nails

To the waitress on roller skates
I love the colour of it all

So I must affect an air
Of a man who?s maybe seen too much
But still just manages to care

Still you?re the chocolate at the end of my Cornetto

Always sets off that X-ray machine

And he wore you like a charm
And you knew yourself
That what had come
Would soon be gone
Well sometimes in your burrowed hole

Would soon be gone
Well sometimes in my burrowed hole

Always moving on

And you were breaking yours with a stone
So I took you home to a bastion
A hurricane by any other name
So I took you home and I crashed you
A hurricane in your veins"

To a house with twisted branches

Out to the edge of the world, out where the sky starts to bend,

These words we shout, so who's to say
Where they will go when they fall away?
Maybe they hang around with the lonely kids,
With a balled up fist, saying, you did this, you did this.

I don't want to fight anymore,
About what we lost or things we swore.
I didn't mean what I said last night.
I love you more than who is right and wrong,
I'm gonna stay and made this song

The morning light goes red to gray
On what we've broken and throw away.
If I could I just know how to walk away from my pride,
Could you help me out? Can we put it back, put it back?

With green glass

One look and he'll remember
One look, one look
One look and he'll remember

Dad in his red Pendleton shirt
Shag carpet, brown sofa
The summer always hot

White and still
He asked if I would
Kiss him goodbye
I knew the answer, ""I will""

When it’s too hot to think, and I try
A taste, just a sip; your sweet, sweet kiss
Like a nice, cold drink you’ve fortified

It was just like I imagined, when we first met
How our fingers became intertwined
I knew, in my heart, that our chances were slim
But a gambler never gambles to be wise

Coo-coo coooo, coo-coo coooo
Magic summertime

Autumn is volatile and winter is cruel
Spring can be tragical, but summertime is magical

There’s an 18-second instrumental segment here

It was just like a fairy tale, when we were introduced
How our eyes, like a flash, filled with light
And I knew, in my heart, we would both avoid the truth
But our cover-up was heaven for a while

Crooked heart and crooked mind.

Crooked how he tried to kiss me
While I ate an apple whole
Everything he said was wrong,
Or else he quoted Bob Dylan.

We never seem to speak
We only remember some things.

Crooked where he put the paper
Underneath the furniture.
He was bent on big bent,
Kicked the trash into the corner.

Crooked how I always bully,
Crooked how I miss the bond.
I was bent on big blent,
Crooked how I keep hoping.

In my old apartment
When everyone left
Someone slept on the couch

I thought about love
And how I love somebody else

Lining up memories
Each one a hair
At the edge of the mirror
I count and I stare

I wish that the quiet would end
With a telephone ring

Into a different thing?

So carefully crafted, mysterious band of gold
And what really comes after, when we grow old?

The right to own, but he's the man who

I just laughed and I turned the other cheek
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re the new kid, and you’re a warrior"
123430,"Was it my imagination?
Did you come out of the past?
You had horses behind you
But I didn’t want to ask
You’re so independent
You never needed nothing
Never needed no one
Never wanted to have fun

That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along
You were standing on the corner
You were waiting for the beast
You had stories of prophets
But I didn’t want to tease
Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire

I should have known right from the start
When you count on nothing, nothing falls apart
And then we stayed out all night
And in the morning you had second sight
That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along
Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire"
123431,"Just about the time, time I get off
You’re gonna roll right past with the radio on I don’t mind
One more time, yeah do it again
But you keep on saying that you’re my friend I don’t mind

Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you’re gone

You take my love and you waste my time
How can I help it if it sure feels fine?
I don’t mind
Here you come again looking like you do
I know you like it when I’m falling all over you
I don’t mind

Radio on

Oh I know that I gotta let you go
Oh I can see that you’re just not the one for me

Radio on
With the radio on
Turn around and you’re gone
Radio on"
123432,"I’ll find you everywhere
If you don’t exist, I don’t care
I’ll find you everywhere

Waterfalls are in the air
If you don’t see them, I don’t care
There are waterfalls in the air

I saw you looking into the mortal mirror
I could see right through you
Even though you were right here

You’re a crystal chandelier
Your prisms ring so clear
Crystal chandelier

I’ll find you everywhere
If you don’t exist, I don’t care
I’ll find you everywhere

And when I saw you
You were hanging out with your friends
I knew that it was over
But I didn’t know it had come to an end"
142966,"Hey, everybody listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me

Hey, everybody listen to me
And I won't come out to play
I won't come out to play

Hey, everybody do it to me
Do it to me
Do it to me

Hey, everybody listen to me
And I won't come out to play
I won't come out to play

Help me
I think I'm quite a bit weathered
Maybe
I'll finally disappear it may take forever

I want
To look a little bit clearer
But your
Exaggeration clouds up my mirror

(Repeat First Verse & Chorus)"
142969,"I need a face, I need a face
I need a face, 'cause the other is wrecked
Another place, another place
Another place in no time will be dead

You try to bowl me over
But you won't just let me be
When you hang on, hang on
Hang on me
All the time

I know a place, I know a place
I know a place, and the owner is dead
Another face, another face
Another face in no time will be wrecked

You want to put me under
And you won't just try and see
That you hang on, hang on
Hang on me
All the time

Another world ago
I could live forever and never show
But that was long ago
Say goodbye and audios 

[Repeat First Verse and Chorus]"
142970,"Looking at you with a tear, oh no
Just don't let it get to you, oh no

Playing on your sympathy
Now you're the bad guy, can't you see

Don't you know it's just a game

You fell for it, give me a break, oh no
Taking more than you can give, oh no

Playing up your misery
And you're the victim can't you see

Don't you know it's just a game

Playing on your sympathy
Yeah you're the bad guy, can't you see

Don't you know it's just a game"
