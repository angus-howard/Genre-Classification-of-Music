[Classic Rock In Spring]

Hey how are ya?
You sure got a way of greeting a man
Might I add the perfect sun tan
You're riding on your yellow Schwinn
While blasting classic rock in spring
A couple of summer demons
With battery recharging
When you hear the Bob Seger song
You know I'll be long gone
Cutting all my classes
Like a hit of acid
Hey how are ya?

Like a dog on a telephone
There is nonsense sustaining
And staying on ya getting off
You find yourself much better off
Feeling a bit less softer even
But coughing up a lung and then some
Yeah, you know i got your battery recharger right here
And hey how are ya?

[Freeway In Mind]

I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
I'm glad that you came if the sound is the same

Sometimes my reckless ways, shock my self system for days
Now I'm channelling my faze in an anacin haze
But it ain't gonna do me in, I know when to dump it
A hole in my way again, I'll surely just jump it

There was a kid in a tree among the birds and the bees
Between bee hive and bird nest and I think you know the rest
He wanted to be free with them but they weren't believing
Pecking and stinging him till he wasn't breathing
But it ain't gonna do him in, he'll just go to heaven
Not done just a dreamer of ten or eleven

I've got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it

Why don't you go out with my girl?
Wouldn't you ... I cried
We'll match you with a bonafide girl
... Bonafide in my mind
To whoever it may concern
Will I love you when you deal a dud?
She won't call me
She won't call me
Stuck in a game like an idiot wrapped in chains
She tells me a place that I couldn't anticipate
Gopacapulco
Let us know you like it when we go there
Gopacapulco
Though we twist inside you gopaculpo, eh
Gopacapulco
Jesse, when she moved up last year
Never gave so many words, oh no
Tell me what you see in my eyes
Please don't love me 'cause I'm telling lies
Don't let me let you go
Well I love it when you tease me girl
Baby, oh baby
Baby, don't go 'cause I love you so
So give me your arms and don't ever
Let me go
Gopacapulco
Let us you know like it when we go, eh
Gopacapulco
Though we twist inside you gopaculpo, eh

C'est la vie, C'est la vie
Comme ci, comme ca

Alright, alright

I named him Jules
He stole my baby then he stole my heart
I knew that he was a tiger
Right from the start
She plays rough with him
'Cause he's her ragamuffin, oh yeah

She played hard but then he got harder
She kicked his head
That's when he got out on her

I said to Jules, ""Just 'cause you're a cat
Don't mean you ain't a man""
""Just 'cause you're a man
Don't mean every pussy need a dad""
""Can't have you cream on my girl
Find another dealer to pawn off your pearls""

Jules lost his jewels
When he came up pearls
They took his manhood
Jules lost his jewels
When he turned 18
Moved down to West Hollywood

Jules lost his jewels
When he came up pearls
They took his manhood
Jules lost his jewels
When he came up pearls
They went to go back to West Hollywood

C'est la vie, C'est la vie
Comme ci, comme ca

Alright, alright, c'mon

Jules made a mess
On my baby's dress late last night
Pumpin' up 'n' down with every whimpering sound
Well oh my!
She shook her knee and woke me up, said ""that
Sick little brat's got my leg in a hump
Well alright""

I pulled on his socks, pinned him down on his back said
""How does that feel?""
Then he sprayed on my lap, no!

Jules lost his jewels
When he came up pearls
They took his manhood
Jules lost his jewels
When he turned 18
Moved down to West Hollywood

Jules lost his jewels
When came up pearls
They took his manhood
Jules lost his jewels
When he turned 18
Moved down to West Hollywood

C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Comme ci, comme ca

Wait, wait, I wait for Kate
(No, she's never coming back to you)
I wait, I wait for Kate so late
(No, she's never gonna miss you)

Demonstrate, my Kate, we mate
(I cannot place her)
I bet on straight, await the take
(No, she's never gonna reach the shore)(x2)

Wait and wait, I wait for Kate
(No, she's never coming back again)
I wait and wait, but Kate's so late
(No, come on home)

PDA, the date today
I nearly made bones to fade
(No, she's got me on my knees again) (x2)

Wait, wait, I wait for Kate
No!
I wait and wait, but Kate's so late
(No, she's never gonna sense you)
(Ah, she's never gonna cherish you)

Gathered at sundown
She left out of her town
(Oh, she's never coming back again)

Creep
Creep, creep, creep
For the first time
Remember the down time

Demonstrate, my Kate, we mate
The bed on straight, await the take
No!

Kathy, I'm waiting
Come over here
I'm coming to love you
Come out here

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
To love you
By my house

Kathy, I'm waiting
Come out here, outside
Come out here
Across the hills

Find me here
Kathy, Kathy, I love you
Find me here

Kathy, I'm waiting

Helen, are you still there?
I can't really tell
Where are you, Helen?

Helen, you say that it's you
Please tell me the truth
That you're not Helen, Helen

Helen, where are you?
Gone on Monday morning
Helen, come back soon

Gone on Monday morning
You left me
Gone on Monday morning
You left your hearts

Helen, staring so long
Please tell me right now
That you're not Helen

Helen, why did you go?
Ages ago we were in Heaven
Helen

Helen where are you
Gone on Monday morning
Helen come back soon

Gone on Monday morning
You left me
Gone on Monday morning
You left your hearts

Ooh, lonely for you (x4)
Helen

Helen, who is this girl?
I'm still in dark
But you're not Helen

Helen, twelve days ago
Since you went home
It feels like Heaven
Helen

Want me, I want me, you want me
I want you to want me but want me, want me

Please, please want me, want me, want me, want me

Want me, I want me, you want me
'Cause right now I know you, hate me, hate me

Please, please want me, want me, want me, want me

I hate me till I hate to tell you but you're thinking
'Bout my mind into one go, put you in this place

Want me, want me, want me, want me
Please, please, please, please want her, want him

Bad boys / Sad girls
Death sure makes a fuss
What are we gonna do when it comes for us?
Nite descends moonlessly / Cops are humming tunelessly
Walking in a straight line
Cold pistol in the inner coat pocket
I hope he don't hear commotion in the park
I hope he don't hear strange animal in the dark

I'm walking alone / The streets are so wet
I'm walking alone / The only thing bright is the streetlight
The only thing warm is the blood in our veins
So I think of warm days as a getaway
Like Valentino in Blood & Sand
It's another sleet nite / The only thing bright is the streetlight
I'm walking alone / The streets are so wet
I'm walking alone / The only thing bright is the streetlight
The only thing warm is the blood in our veins
So I think of warm days as a getaway
It's another sleet nite / The only thing bright is the streetlight
I'm walking alone
Life is borrowed / Sometimes blue
What are we gonna do ?
What are we gonna do when it comes for us ?
Bad boys / Sad girls / Death sure makes a fuss
What are we gonna do when it comes for us ?
What are we gonna do when it comes for us ?

Do not be afraid
(You cannot be afraid)
Your arms are wrapped around
(Do not be afraid / There's nothing to do)
And the claps your hands resound
(Do not be afraid / Do you feel really afraid?)
Your feet they map the ground
(Do not be afraid / It's not being afraid)
You'll have night visions
(Do not be afraid / Of not being afraid)
Your window when it's jostled
(Do not be afraid / Do not be afraid)
We'll spend time
(Do not be afraid / To go / Around friends)
Over and over
(Do not be afraid)
We'll spend time in the mountains

1195,"

I want to go back across that sea
With my hands out, with my hands out
And I will rise from the water
Though I'm cold and wet, I will be clean

I want to come back from this robbery
With my hands up, with my hands up
And I will lie down and be handcuffed
Take me, I will be yours
Dripping wet
Just try and hold me
I am dripping wet and limp

"
1196,"

From your head grew two braids
Gold and long
Golden long hair, golden long hair
One braid on one side of your face hung
Cabled and calm
It seemed to say, as it swayed
That it hung there hoping to charm me
(Or somebody)
""Can you imagine me in your bed at dawn?""
Said your long hair, said your long hair
""or kids with my face, can you see them?
Tiny and blonde!""
The other braid on the other side of your face was lost
In the folds of your clothing, having stayed there this morning
When you got up and put your clothes on
It seemed to say as it lay down your shoulder blade
""Leave me alone! Can't you let me be tucked in then go?
Why do you gawk there with the prying long stare?
I know you think I could make you happy
If you could just stroke golden long hair
But you're wrong there!""
So your two blonde braids sang me this song and, in between them, your
Face sang along, saying:
""Calm yourself down, Phil, be calm
You'll find that the beautiful long braids that you fawn over aching to
Own
Do in fact sway for you, though not you alone
There is also that gold in your palm, on your shoulder, and everywhere
Where it belongs
So don't try to say 'Spring is my own private dawn!'
Because us braids and cute faces make moms
And more laughing and licking and kids and their mouths
All living their lives in the throng.""

1197,"

Flame upon Flame upon Flame
Reaching out to wrap around
My reaching arm
That's how life got to be among my friends

I wanted her so bad
I waited around in a burning down house
Hoping for phone calls
Totally scalded and scarred
I woke up in a pile of ash

Grave beyond Grave beyond Grave
Stretching out to horizons
On all sides
That's how life got to be among my friends
Dead or alive I buried them all

I wanted her so bad
As revenge for my burning
I burned the whole world
And was warm for a little while

"
1198,"

I walked down off the trail
Onto the wet leaves
And rotting wood
Under mossy branches
And stood listening
An airplane came from the west
The sound of a house's door
Teenage girls from the north
Faintly in the almost black light
A tiny bird fell from nowhere
Onto the wet leaves
And sang at my feet
And the owls were loud
On all sides of me
They gave voice
To Mount Eerie
The dark unknown wild
Beautiful dark dark
Little bird in the leaves
Fluttered and flew off
When I moved my leg
It flew off chirping
Through the dark forest
Turned around, my brother had left
The airplane circled around to the east
The door closed
And the pregnant house
Just through the trees
With its fire and music
Was afloat on the wide black ocean
Made by the owls that coo in the night

And the mountain moved through the trees
With night vision
With long eyes
With a ghost
With a dark voice
""What do you want?""
""What do you want?""
I'm not telling
""What do you want?""
I can't say it
""What do you want?""

Do not be afraid
The war of the worlds that's gonna come
Do not be afraid
Your whole body
Do not be afraid
The dark night on the unlit trail
Do not be afraid
There's nothing to do
You can't get away

"
1199,"

I see people singing their songs
Relying on the words
Their mouths won't work without their minds
Singing with mouths and minds at odds
The mind creates no tangles
Our mind creates no walls or chains
Just examine your own self
Don't look stand-ins for your work
Become the master of your mouth
Know there's no inside and no out

There's no business like stealing
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Stealing everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling
When you are stealing people like show people
There's no stealing like stealing show people

The headaches, the heartaches
The back aches, the flops
Even when you are stealing
The turkey that you know will fold
You may be stealing out in the cold
Then you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the stealing
Stealing
Stealing
And why
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby, woo!)

Because there's no business like stealing music I know
Angels come from everywhere with lots of music
And when you butcher it there's no attack
Where could you get music that you don't give back
And on top of that get that happy feeling
When you are stealing that extra music
Let's go on with the stealing
Why
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why!)

Because there's no music like butcher music
Like no music I know
The music business people with lots of jack
They don't run out of dough
The music butcher
They gladly get paid for what they do
But they're stranded out in the cold
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)

And why
(Why, why, why, baby)
And
The music
Music
Music butcher

(Woo, yeah, woo)

There's no business like no business
(Woo, woo)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Woo!)

Because butcher music is so thrilling
Standing out in front on opening night
And you're stealing up there in lights
Smiling as you watch the music butcher
Butcher show music

Why
(Why, why, why)
And why
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why!)

Because stealing
The music with the labels pasted on is appealing
Stealing everything that music business people don't allow
Yesterday they told you
Butcher music would not go far
That night you open and there you are
Stealing music
Let's go on with the
(Woo, woo)
On with the
(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)
Let's go on with stealing the show

The rhymes in the trees
Are old and diseased
But, oh, they sound so pretty to me

The children wait in line
With jars of alkaline
To place at the feet of the Glorious Spine

All the little crimes
That brighten their lives
Made them dance
Like widows against
An iridescent sky
Where the oceans collide
And shower the land
With fire again

The minions of the wind
Cough and spin
Rattle the cages of the invalids

The convalescing rhymes
Embalm their own minds
And take to the waves of an infinite sea

All the little crimes that brighten their lives
Made them dance like widows against
An iridescent sky where the oceans collide
And shower the land with fire again

The chosen ones
With the punctured lungs
And all the rest
With deflating breasts
After long and dull debate
Decided that it would be best
To scatter ounces for the feast
And hope these ailments would cease

Hey, pulling yarns from the stockings of the sky...

Lucy and her next of kin
Sacrificed the Hoopty Twins
To the god of halibut and fins
But when the stench took to the winds
The styes marched onward singing hymns
That sounded more like battle cries

Hey, pulling yarns from the stockings of the sky...

The Shock Board of Glamour-
They struck the truth down with their hammers
Till skies turned green

Organ donors please beware
That the goings-on going on here
Are triple threat to the fancy fare
Who live each day with the lasting fear
That one day when they're dying they will realize that they've missed it all

Hey, pulling yarns from the stockings of the sky...

Madame Morse Estate
Stood five hundred years
Painted black by love
Bathed in widows' tears

She had a maid
The maid remained to tend her
She tied and drowned her
When she caught her in bed with her gardener

But she loves him (yeah yeah)
She loves him (yeah yeah)
And how she loves that estate

Estate, estate...

She wouldn't concede out of vanity that
Her servant would ever
Find her love

Her reflection would cry
Down in the lake where she threw the
Corpse for all time

Oh, madame, sad is this estate
Love blew the roof of your estate

Madame, mad mad love
Madame, cheer up!
Come on!

Madame Morse Estate
Fell one summer's day
Rolling down to the water
Where the madams made pants
To her mother, she loves her

She loves her
Oh, and how she loves her (yeah yeah)
And how she loves that estate

She wouldn't concede out of vanity that
Her servant would ever
Find her love

Her reflection would cry
Down in the lake where she threw the
Corpse for all time

Oh, madame, sad is this estate
Love blew the roof of your estate

Madame, mad mad love
Madame, mad mad love

Madame, or love that's mad?
Cheer up!

I live all alone leaving minutes off
I won't talk, I travel thinking about
Me changing something out of this, but
This exists before you and me swim in this mud

But I am wrong again
One in a million of solitudes
I can't climb my stairs
Trapped by the heaviest mask
I won't spread my chest
Pumping between anger and lust
I pray the Lord to rest
But my hearts still beats

I have become to feel so weird so
Far, so strange in this viscous life
Roots over me drowning, choking
Life, I must dry, fall and feed the grass before I burn

But I am wrong again
I can't climb my stairs
I won't spread my chest

But my heart still beats

Now that I am all alone, I know that I've always been
I will always be, I don't pretend otherwise

I am getting old and something I don't know
Sucks my sap, consumes my old smile
An immortal hell with demons
That feed on dull years
A life, that is death
Doesn't end if you don't breathe

I look back and the road seems so curved and rough
Before me all is straight

I thrashed you, you loved me
But I owned my reason
Over and over, I tried to conceal
What in me should be less than a simple fear
Older and colder
We just approach to fall

We met on The Carolinian - heading south from D.C
It's as if God himself had picked out our seats
She smiled and said Richmond when I asked where she was bound
I began to wish my life away to have been born in that town
We talked a little bit and then she smiled
I saw down in her eyes
She wasn't just beautiful, she was kind and she was wise
But a woman down in Raleigh, would soon have my son
So I waited for her station like the bullet from a gun
She's in Richmond with my heart - And I'm bound for Carolina
Wish I'd never met this train or the girl that's left behind her
When the train reached the station, she looked me in the eye
Said, Come with me to Richmond and we'll start a brand new life
Well you know that moment still weighs on my mind
'Cause I took my body to Raleigh, and left my heart behind
She's in Richmond with my heart - And I'm bound for Carolina
Wish I'd never met this train or the girl that's left behind her- now we're apart
While I'm bound for Caroline - she's in Richmond with my heart
My son is grown up to my hand, and he fills me with pride
I take him down to the station to watch the trains roll by
But that northbound Carolinian always makes the teardrops start
Cause its headed up to Virginia where I left my heart
She's in Richmond with my heart - And I'm bound for Carolina
Wish I'd never met this train or the girl that's left behind her- now we're apart
While I'm down in Caroline - she's in Richmond with my heart
I'm still down in Caroline, she's in Richmond with my heart

Take the chip of a star and you hit it with an iron bar
And when its broken in two - you've made the eyes for you
Take the song from a bird and you turn it to words
And when you're through - you've found a voice for you
Like a song on the wind - My beautiful friend
Take the coat of a tree - Autumn's fallen leaves
Weave them gold and fair - and that is your hair
Take the pale of the moon, dip into it with a spoon
Touch the earth again and that is your skin
Come to me again - My beautiful friend
For you were born when the world first turned
The flames flickered and the first fires burned
You are the phoenix and the heavens clear
Let you be mine and I'll call you dear
Take the clouds from the sky and the sun shone bright
Shape them with a file and that is your smile
Take the heat of the earth when the mountains burst
Put it in a mold and your heart you'll hold
Like a song on the wind - my beautiful friend
Together to the end, My beautiful friend

Know her when she was just so tall
Back when she was belle of the ball
Now she is a woman all but grown
Know her when she was just so tall
Back when she was belle of the ball
Now she is a woman all but grown
Who knows the things are rising on

She's a woman now
Somehow I'm gonna get her back
The girl she used to be

Met again in our college years
Back when the moral had no fear
She once placed flowers in her hair
But now a shade of gray is all that's there

She's a woman now
Somehow I'm gonna get her back
The girl she used to be

Love the sense of first good walk
She is the reason I first could talk
Hold her hand when she gets scared
And for a moment the child is there

Afraid of what tomorrow bring
Like late at night the phone does ring
She toss and turn throughout the night
Who knows the cause of all that fright

She's a woman now
Somehow I'm gonna get her back
The girl she used to be

She's a woman now
Somehow I'm gonna get her back
The girl she used to be

Zyklon-B was a terrible gas 'cause it killed off all those jews
That's why it made such a good gas from Hitler's point of view

Points of view

I like 'Obey' by The Brainbombs
And lots of you do too
But Sarah Payne's poor mum and dad can't share that point of view

Points of view

The bombs in your bag, it kills fifteen
But it also kills you
You must have been very serious
About your point of view

Points of view

'Kill all the Pakis!' rings out again
In the pubs and football stands
That's a point of view which can be very hard to understand

But humans have hot red blood
They like it on their hands
Men kill men kill men kill men
'Til not one human stands

Fries are free
Toast is free
Kisses are free too
Your granddad killed a lot of niggers
To buy those free things for you
Now a bunch of Pakis wants to take them away from you
What color face deserves what depends upon your point of view

Personally, I think, and this is just my point of view

She knows she's looking at me
She follows me down to the sea
She follows me into the sea

And I wanna know why, I wanna know why
I'm wondering why, I'm wondering why
I wanna know why, I wanna know, wanna know why
I wanna know why, wanna know, wanna know why, wanna know why
I wanna know why, wanna know, wanna know why, wanna know why

Still astonished by this spark of light
Still astonished by this spark of light
Like the sun swallowed by the sea the waters call for me
Like the sun swallowed by the sea

Pulls me under, rips the sun asunder
Pulls me under, rips the sun asunder

I fight to find my life through these labyrinths of light
On a flight to find my life
I fight to find my life through these designs of light
On a flight to find my life

I'm still astonished by this spark of light

Like the sun swallowed by the sea the waters call for me
Like the sun swallowed by the sea

Even as these waters writhe
Still astonished by this spark of life
Even as these waters rise

Thunderbolts and nightsticks
Coming out of the sky
Flames overhead
Rain until you cry
My baby's on the highway
Come in from the cold
Never going home
Never going home

D for disaster
E for my eyes
A for my anger
D before I die
M for Mona
O oh good
O oh good
N for the night
Dead Moon Night
Dead Moon Night

Call me if you need me
Down in New Orleans
Can't release the victims
Have you seen what I've seen
In New York City
Don't you cross the line
Guard it from the light
Guard it from the light

Hazard on the highway
Breakin' down slow
They thought she was lookin'
Now I'm all alone
I'm often abandoned
Won't you take me home
Now I'm all alone

[Verse 1]
Stranded in the storm trying to see through the rain
Looks like my life's coming 'round again
I wouldn't stop it now even if I thought I could
Yeah, I was one of the remnants from a burned out scene
Trying to recover from the years between
What they didn't want then is what they think they want now

[Chorus]
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

[Verse 2]
I'd been pickin' up the pieces from another hard fall
Waitin' by the phone for an overseas call
They wanted my past and they wanted it now
I could sense it in the air, feel it in my veins
Something was coming to take me away
I'd been lost for so long, maybe it's the price we all pay

[Chorus]
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

[Verse 3]
I looked in the mirror trying to see
What it was they had killed in me
And why can't I no longer believe
I wandered around and I swore by God
I would never give in no matter how hard they fought
I've waited too long to have it any other way

[Chorus]
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

You've crushed the resistance before it's begun
Silenced the voices who've dared to confront
Laying your hands upon all that you rule
Becoming the man who you overthrew
Now you better watch out
'cause johnny's got a gun

[Verse 1]
You've got all the armies, you've got all the arms
You've got all the armories
The harbor's blockaded, the streets barricaded
Every thought's under lock and key
There's an idea rising that you can't detect
From the same poor souls that you say you protect
There's a violent burning hatred in every mother's son

[Refrain]
You better watch out, 'cause Johnny's got a gun

[Verse 2]
You've anchored your warships, cleared all the airstrips
Readied the seeds of decay
Stolen the youth to fill the ranks in your troops
Keeping rebellion at bay
The fathers before us who now line the graves
Are being remembered before it's too late
And their sons you call rebels are becoming one

[Refrain]
You better watch out, 'cause Johnny's got a gun

[Verse 3]
The hour's upon you, the past will soon haunt you
Yesterday becomes today
The helpless, the hopeless, the lost ones, the homeless
The weak can afford to be brave
There's only so much a poor man can take
Before he no longer fears making mistakes
If dying's the answer, then dying be done

[Refrain]
You better watch out, 'cause Johnny's got a gun

[Verse 4]
They come from the country, the city and shore
They come from the wind and the rain
They come from the fires who's ashes are cold
They come from the desert and snow
They fear they'll be dying but more than that fear
The cries of oppression that no ears can hear
Until every last rebel surrenders or runs

[Refrain]
You better watch out, 'cause Johnny's got a gun

I had to trace the clouds with the dark side looking in
I couldn't play the lie, it's just the way it's been
I never wanted to clear the pages in my life
I just came across to try it one more time
I wanna live these times with you

I couldn't find the road, the signs had been wiped out
I couldn't hear you after silence stunned the crowd
I was ready for change before it slipped away
I wanna steal the heart that holds the break of day
I wanna live these times with you

With some false delay before we take the fall
We seem to capture the pain before we face the wall
I never understood the things that cause our plight
I guess shadows falling down won't make things right
I wanna live these times with you

For laters
Would you stable those spuds
Beside you, inside you?

Ma'am your stable seems so invitin'

Beneath the arc of the rounded rainbow ley
Whistled the lark as the arrow lost its way
The Blue lightless perfect-colored obfuscaire
Still supine, I crossed the sandy veil
Falling forever through each measure;
All moral minds sentinel
Falling to Hell
Breathe together
Farewell
The circle we drew as we moved but tried to look down was wiped away with the sound of the morning rooster's crow...
His tail was tied to a hammer and he dragged it to the horizon
In the hallway outside my bedroom door
I heard the old dead sleigh gliding to its restful drones, purposely knocking the pictures off their nails
With a vacancy ogling my sober inhalation, our curator's rocking to the rhythm of the rain on her carved hair here in this room, with the inverted torches at its barrier, where materia vibrated out
Its vibration left a plume climbing its way up a blue-blessed curl, which was girdled by aurora of obliging black morel
Then, I called and cried out while I minded the bell that dangled crazily closet edge of the basin of the rain which fell
(It fell in the shape of a bifurcated ammonite shell)
A beacon as blue as a bowerbird's eye in the morn
A poem written in threes over four
My oeuvre based on the coy and forlorn
Another boy's parallel night in the harrow
And the quiet decline of my questionable rhythm
Disinterested forever in upwards motion
I hung out by the white chalk letters
I watched my body move and let it

One morning, before the leaves began changing
I caught a piece of summer and poured it into a pitcher;

This I placed in the cellar on a shelf collecting dust
Autumn, then winter, rose up from the sea, and my
Garden was a garden filled with unbroken snow

No flower strained it's face to the ice giants' whisper
No life coloured the vision of a newborn Spring babe
My cellar-water dripping into a pail

And I lifted my piece of summer
Like a piece of a memory or a dream

Like these, caught on film
And carried it to the garden floes
The wind turning drifting stars to madness

Poured forth gracefully, this ctheric tincture
Lifts winter's coat-of-arms with coaxing aromas and electricity
Used with vigilance, a Pitcher of Summer stirs a memory into swooning
And bravely, the flowers of the past will stretch their limbs into the sky
While snow falls quietly all around

"
3735,"

In the river where I been weeping
In the holly where the cold wind blows
A list of secrets that I been keeping
First the seed and then the garden grows

The waves tell of a secret seeping
And everything is gonna overflow
And high above, a sky above
I hear a buzzing, I hear a winging
Listen close and hear the birdies singing

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Oh the songs you would sing if you had wings
And you could sing anything
I'd sing la la la la la la la la la la

The memory collector
The creak feeling
Takes you in and send you reeling
It's your being in the simplest song
It's the melody so strong
It won't let you forgot
What it is that you've done

Between the brain and the blackboard
Every lesson
Right or wrong you know that you're still guessing
And that shine hasn't been replaced
It'll hide in lines there on your face
They don't let you forget
Where it was that you came from

It the cool air, late afternoon
Sitting alone there on the floor of my room
The fireplace crackles, down the hall
""Dinner's ready!"", I hear Mother call
I remember your childhood hair
Flowing wild at the county fair
And how you'd ride on the Himalaya

We got walls and prank calls
Hey you know who that's coming from
Some old lover who ain't getting none

You know while love may never truly be free
Hey it's cheaper than the price of gasoline (yes it is)

Aquatic master of the theory of flow
And well well, when my well had gone dry
Hey then you come along

And it never found it's way on down to me

I think of a scenario of you and the stereo
And now the sun pours through the window to the right
And now the sun pours through the window and it's all right
Hey now the sun comes through the window and it's all right

Ain't it a shame how the rain got stuck up in the willow tree?

In my way, I would explain, encapsulate a hurricane
That's with me every night and day, in my fingers and my brain
The pressure that these words contain
To love you is the highest high, higher than the highest high
To look you right into the eye, my black-haired girl
She knows I love her conversation undercover
We'll pay no mind to pouring rain, below the branches make our way
Insects tumble, we can fumble for words
While the silence winds its lazy way into another day

One man, one man without a gun
Lonely...one man who stood alone
His name was Jesus named after
A man who hung on a cross
He is not a man of consequence
Jesus did not have a prayer
For he was pitted against the sort of folks
That are not the sort of folks
Who are the sort who care

One man, one man without a gun
Lonely...one man who had no one
Dying, he died a William Holden death
Drunken, liquor upon his dying breath
His blood flowed, his mighty rivers blow
But he did not suffer any pain

His final act was to not act at all
The nectar had boiled his brain

One man, one man without a gun
Lonely...one man who stood alone
All dressed up with no place special to go
As he stands and knocks at the gates of heaven
The lord he was out
The gates were all locked up
A sign hung on the gate
Said the lord would return at seven

I see an orange shimmer on the horizon
Swallowing some airplane pulling an airflag
So gravity brought back my banana
But that orange is still millions of miles above me
I see the foreign girls colonizing college benches babe
I see their Russian burly boyfriends shining comprehensively
I see my own lonely reflection within the very girl I love
I see a zigzag embroidered above my family

So as a human tractor trailer I push forward
Into the bright but wild unknown
With gasoline up to my eyelids
But is it real? Is it real? Is it real?
Little Mitchell round my head singing and saying grace
And diesel fumes up in my personal space
Forklift mirage a foot in front of my mind
It's always me behind the controls

You can't pull the stops on a one-eyed cop
My drop, a drip, a Freudian slip
When your mind speed peels out at a hundred and three
But view 'cause even one I can see
Because you can't, you won't, you don't do nothing
You don't stay young, true
Because you can't, you won't, you don't do nothing

You're riding on your yellow Schwinn
While blasting classic rock in spring
A couple of summer demons
With battery recharging
When you hear the Bob Seger song
You know I'll be long gone
Cutting all my classes
Like a hit of acid
Hey how are ya?

Like a dog on a telephone
There is nonsense sustaining
And staying on ya getting off
You find yourself much better off
Feeling a bit less softer even
But coughing up a lung and then some
Yeah, you know i got your battery recharger right here
And hey how are ya?

[Freeway In Mind]

I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
I'm glad that you came if the sound is the same

Sometimes my reckless ways, shock my self system for days
Now I'm channelling my faze in an anacin haze
But it ain't gonna do me in, I know when to dump it
A hole in my way again, I'll surely just jump it

There was a kid in a tree among the birds and the bees
Between bee hive and bird nest and I think you know the rest
He wanted to be free with them but they weren't believing
Pecking and stinging him till he wasn't breathing
But it ain't gonna do him in, he'll just go to heaven
Not done just a dreamer of ten or eleven

I've got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it

I've got no hooker's heart of gold
My hooks are sharp, my heart is cold
The men just come, and they go like flies
Chewing my lips, and drinking my eyes
And I've been penetrated
So I'm welcome everywhere I go
This mouth has wrapped around something
More delicious than the songs I sing
And not just men have known my charms
You women too, with your golden arms
Waxed bare in Europe's fine salons
My shining blond and golden johns
With legs spread wide like scissors
Waiting open for your prey
With fingers pinched like tweezers
Plucking every hair that's stray
Don't you pluck me out of your dear breast
Where my poor head is laid to rest
Don't you pluck me out of your dear eye
Where I am curling up to die
Days go by like butterflies
Days go by like butterflies
Days go by like butterflies
Days go by like butterflies
Come on look at the sky
Come on look at the sky

You said I am despicable, you said I am a whore, I am young enough to have it all but I don't want any more. Dress me up in plastic and my skin is getting sore, I am wanking in the corner waiting for the nuclear war. Hoarding all the garbage and it's filling up my car, my suffering is meaningless, I'm stinking like the tar that smothers all the grass and lets me drive you to the bar, and if you want to handle me just tell me who you are
My tits are made of silicone just like the earth and sea. I am swallowing more estrogen so you won't impregnate me. Swarming swarming little bratsies, hollering and mean, eat your oily cereal and keep your nostrils clean. The chemicals are coming for you keeping you alive, the bees are up and vomiting outside the old beehive. Swarming swarming little beasties, sniveling and weak, the strong are taking everything and stamping on the meek
Baby if you love me you should stab me in the lung and let me strangle you before your breath blocks out the sun. You're going to die anyway so let me kill you now. I'll send you back to heaven cause you're already in hell. You're going to die anyway so let me kill you nice. Everything is paid for and I'm puking up the price. My vomit is a rainbow-colored smorgasbord of snurt, in every colored chemical that made my belly hurt
The microcosmic spiraled eggs inside my uterus are sparkling and bursting with the greenest yellow pus. The milk that feeds my baby from my breast is flowing black. It looks like oil and smells like death and I can't hold it back. I fell asleep and dreamland panthers tore me limb from limb. My lover was a big black cat. I couldn't handle him. I wanted to get water from a soft and slimy stream, but all the critters by the river died inside my dreams
Floating on their backs they turned their bellies to the sky. I sprinkled black oil from my breast on each and every eye. I took a mouthful of the cheapest Dominican rum and blew a ball of fire from the flame inside my tongue. All the bodies in the brine were quickly set alight. They floundered there and let their furry flames fire up the night. Patiently the panthers pieced me back together again. I woke up and I welcomed back the ugly world of men

I never learned how to spin plates on sticks
But i have a coat that makes me look just like a bird
Just like a bird
Whenever I go running in it people they smile
Especially when I throw bird feet into the air
Into the air
But on the surface I look warm
But on the surface I look warm
But underneath that is wool and water
And underneath the water and wool I am cold
Cold
Cold
I have a friend who looks like a bear
Whenever he throws his big hands into the air
People tend to leave
And people tend to cry
He lives in a cave right down the street
And this time of year you'd think he'd be asleep
But he's not
He's admiring his porcelein spoon collection
His porcelein spoon collection
But on the surface he looks cold
But on the surface he looks cold
But underneath that is cotton and candy
And underneath the candy and cotton he is cold
Cold
Cold
I never learned how to spin plates on sticks
And I never learned how to spin plates on sticks
And I never learned
But oh we are friends
Together we have partners
I'll make him laugh and he keeps me safe
Well I'll make him laugh and he keeps me clean
Clean

Carl Sagan's calm attitude
Things are going well, friends coming home
And me, I'll be there soon

And it's hot and these cloths are wearing thin
And I'm riding backwards on our tree
And I'm carving letters on this tree

He's sleeping with bark ships on his tongue
And he's dreaming that his mouth tastes like blood
And now you're it, chasing chain link fences on our run
And no one, no one gives a fuck what we'll become

Pay attention
Pay attention
Pay attention
Pay attention

And I'm riding backwards on this tree
And I'm viewing the cosmos from our street
And I'm Chasing letters up this tree
And I'm riding backwards down our street
And I'm riding backwards down our street
And I'm riding backwards down our street

She built her house on the sand
And oh she paid her bills
Until one day, her man, he died
And a fractured clan moved in

Build stairs upon stairs and rooms upon rooms
And doors that go nowhere
Build stairs upon stairs and rooms upon rooms
And doors that go nowhere

Singing you're not going anywhere
And your not going anywhere
And you're not going anywhere without us
Singing you're not going anywhere
And your not going anywhere
And you're not going anywhere without us

She moved one ten tons of bricks
From one side of this room to the other
Tremors buck the land and wind whips the endless flags
Singing we are men of the C
Grew blue blood off the trade
Until one day each of us fell and fall we did
Our hearts grew black with silk and masks from the dutch tea C

Singing there is imbalance here
And there is imbalance here
And oh we've lost our trade

She moved one ten tons of bricks
From one side of her life into another

That I was a stripe
Running up your arm
Killing you at work

It's the speed of what's to come
It's the speed of what's to come
It's running up your spine and you won't let it go

Well I had a thought
That I was a vein
Running up your leg
Infecting your heart

It's the speed of what's to come
It's the speed of what's to come

Well it tears me apart
Well it tears me in two

You're a joy, you're a joy, you're a joy to me

Wash my face free of dirt

The sun don't shine to keep us warm

Never gonna be the one to save me
Ill tell you everything but its never gonna mean that I will change
Never gonna mean that I will change
Ill sit alone﻿ again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Wish things could stay how theyve been
But its a hard world for little things
And theres no way I...
Theres no way I could ever be
All of the things you want from me
And just because sometimes it seems that I dont care for you.... I still do
Black tears through eyeliner for you
Black tears through eyeliner
For all the things that weve been through
And I cry black tears
Ive used up all my lies
But Im never gonna be the one to say
Never gonna be the one to say
That I want no more goodbyes
Im never gonna be the one who stays
Never gonna be the one who stays

Says time is passing
But the bubbles in her heart are everlasting
Yeah, she gave her life to art
And who could blame her?
It's pretty major
Fraught with danger and stuff
Like that

Oh, mighty engine
Of good intention
You're purring softly beside me
Grinding gently inside me
Tapping totally madly
For you

Says the plot is getting strange
It's taken over
And the hero's run away
And no one told her
But she can't control the page
It's taken over
There's people dying, semicolons crying
And full stops finding fault
Oh, what a dolt

Cindy writes of kerosene
And broken bottles
Says the troubles were a part of someone's childhood
But she can't get past the point
Where someone's dying
It's pretty minor
A pithy liner should sort it out
But he won't die
He just mucks about
Oh, it's so hard

Now we've broken out the gin
It helps her thinking
And given into sin
We're breathing deeply
But something's on her mind
A chapter stirring
Her mind is whirling
And off she trots
To tap her keys to the top

Oh, she's off

Of good intention
You're purring softly beside me
Grinding gently inside me

What is not but could be if
What could appear in the morning mist
With all associated risk
What is not but could be if

What was not but could have been
Was my obsession way back when
Now I just remember this
What is not but could be if

What is not but could be if
We could be crossing this abridged abyss
Into beginning

When failure’s got you in its grasp
And you’re reaching for your very last
It’s just beginning

One has lived life carelessly
If he or she has failed to see
That the truth is not alive or dead
The truth is struggling to be said

So how do we get out of this
Family shadows all of this
Through what is not but could be if
With all associated risk

What is not but could be if
We could be crossing this abridged abyss
Into beginning

When failure’s got you in its grasp
And you’re reaching for your very last
It’s just beginning

Troubles, no troubles
On the line
And I can't stand to see you
I can't stand to see you
When you're crying at home

Scotch and penicillin
Please try Carlton
A cold black maple hangar
And husbands on the run

I just got back from a dream attack
That took me by surprise
And in there I met a lady
Her name was Shady Sides

And she said

""It's been evening all day long
It's been evening all day long
And how can something so old
Be so wrong.""

Sin and gravity
Drag me down to sleep
To dream of trains across the sea
Trains across the sea

Half hours on earth
What are they worth
I don't know

In 27 years
I've drunk fifty thousand beers
And they just wash against me
Like the sea into a pier...

[Verse 1: David Berman]
I saw the river playing in the valley
Rushing 'round a bend and skipping stones
I saw the meadow wobble in the moonlight
I've come to get my girl and take her home

Her doorbell plays a bar of Stephen Foster
Her sister never left and look what it cost her
We're gonna live in Nashville and I'll make a career
Out of writing sad songs and getting paid by the tear

[Chorus]
Marry me and leave Kentucky
Come to Tennessee
Cause you're the only ten I see
You're the only ten I see

[Chorus 2: Cassie Berman]
I've looked through offices and honky-tonks for men man enough to be
Mr. Mrs. Tennessee
Mr. Mrs. Tennessee

Punk rock died when the first kid said
""Punk's not dead, punk's not dead""
You know Louisville is death, we've got to up and move
Because the dead do not improve

Goodbye users and suckers and steady bad luckers
We're off to the land of club soda unbridled
We're off to the land of hot middle-aged women
Off to the land whose blood runneth orange

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

"
4207,

No, I don't really want to die
I only want to die in your eyes
I'm still here below the chandelier
Where they always used to read us our rights

I want to wander through the night
As a figure in the distance even to my own eye
Have you ever rented a room
Have you ever even rented a room

An anchor lets you see the river move
But now that your evil dreams came true
There on your face
A row of teeth he'll come to replace

I know you laughed when I left
But you really only hurt yourself
When you see your curtains move in the wind
You can bet I'm betting against you again

Cause I'm a man who has a wife who has a mother
Who married one but she loved another
You're a tower without the bells
You're a negative wishing well

I should have checked the stable door
For the name of the sire and dam
You were always at the dog track
With your brother and all his friends

Chalk lines around my body
Like the shoreline of a lake
Your laughter made me nervous
It made your body shake too hard

Now there's a lot of things that I'm gonna miss
Like thunder down country and the way water drips
When you're running for the door in the rain
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
See my name

No, I didn't really want to die
I only want to die in your eyes
Grant me one last wish
Life should mean a lot less than this
Grant me one last wish
Life should mean a lot less than this

In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection
Slowly screwing my way across Europe, they had to make a correction
Broken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake
I tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake

I know you like to line dance, everything so democratic and cool
But baby there's no guidance when random rules

I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls
Maybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls
But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed
And that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said:

""Yeah, you look like someone
Yeah you look like someone who up and left me low
Boy, you look like someone I used to know.""

I know you like to line dance, everything so democratic and cool
But lately, there's no guidance when random rules

I asked the painter why the roads are colored black
He said, ""Steve, it's because people leave
And no highway will bring them back.""
So if you don't want me I promise not to linger
But before I go I gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger

No one should have two lives
Now you know my middle names are wrong and right
Honey we've got two lives to give tonight

Where does an animal sleep
When the ground is wet?
Cows in the ballroom
Chickens in the farmer's corvette

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed

How does an animal see
Once the sun is set?
Bandits in the capital
Limited civilian unrest

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed

What kind of animal
Needs to smoke a cigarette?
Grass in the pasture
Is sharper than a bayonette

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed

Happiness won't leave me alone
Says a bird in his nest
Get a load of this fuckin' view
Its the best in the west

Cranes on the downtown skyline
Is a sight to see for some
It ought to make a few reputations
In the cult of number one

While these seconds turn these minutes
Into hours of the day
While these doubles drive the dollars
And the light of day away

Suffering jukebox
Such a sad machine
You’re all filled up with what other people mean
And they never seem to turn you up loud
Got a lot of chatterboxes in this crowd

Suffering jukebox
In a happy town
You’re over in the corner breakin’ down
They always seem to keep you way down low
The people in this town don’t want to know

Well I guess all that mad misery
Must make it seem true to you
But money lights your world up
You’re trapped what can you do?

You got Tennessee tendencies
And chemical dependencies
You make the same old jokes
And malaprops on cue

Suffering jukebox
Such a sad machine
You’re all filled up with what other people mean
Hardship, damnation and guilt
Make you wonder why you were even built

Suffering jukebox
In a happy town
You’re over in the corner breaking down
They always seem to keep you way down low
The people in this town don’t want to know

I'm drunk on a couch in Nashville
In a duplex near the reservoir
And every single thought is like a punch in the face
I'm like a rabbit freezing on a star

On the wrong side of Sunday morning
Shattered in the terrible light
Working for a bankrupt circus
On the wrong side of Saturday night

And I wanna be like water if I can
Cause water doesn't give a damn
Water doesn't give a damn

Chased by a floating hatchet
You can't just shoot your way out and go
I could tell you things about this wallpaper
That you'd never ever want to know

But there's an altar in the valley
For the things in themselves as they are
And the triumph of the obstacle
And horseleg swastikas

I wanna take a ride on the back of a sunbird
Up into the highest number
Up into the highest number

And I wanna be like water if I can
Cause water doesn't give a damn
Water doesn't give a damn

Father drove a steamroller
Momma was a crossing guard
She got rolled when he got steamed
And I got left in charge
Living in a little town with my pedigree in shards
I chopped down a weeping willow tree
And built this party barge

Ports of call, dayglo bait
Why not see a legend while it's still being made?
Things get kind of squirrelly when you're sleeping in the park
Jam too far propagating in the night
My colleagues and associates have kicked out all the lights
Like I said they say, nothing stops a party barge

""This is lake directory, calling party barge
I'm on the phone with pump control, they say you are at large
Send us your coordinates, we'll send a Saint Bernard""
Think it's kind of squirrelly when you're sleeping in the park
Chicken fried pigeon in a Sonny James sauce
Satan's jeweled lobster has your wife in its claws
Like I said they say, nothing stops a party barge

Bobby took a ride on a California night
On the 7:35 from Salinas
Didn't hear a sound there was no one else around
He said 'The sky has come between us'

Are you really sure that now's the time?
Are you ready to be saved
On the Southern California Line?

Bobby made a list of the places he had missed
And the places where he'd been forgotten
Looked upon the list and he tore the list to bits
And he wondered how it turned so rotten

Bobby's last connection was a thought about confession
And a 25-to-life in prison
Took a load of pills, leaned against the windowsill
And waited till his soul had risen

You, are so hypnotic
You, so metronomic
You do something to me

You know how to play me
You can't help but slay me
You do something to me

Ch:

You take me out of this world
Oh, so high above this world
You do something to me

You have elevated
You, what God created
You do something to me

You are levitation
You are my sensation
You do something to me (ch)

I'm buying time
But I've got no place to put it
I draw the line
But that shouldn't slow me down, now should it?

Riding against the minutes
Outside the city limits
Burning deep inside me like
Death Valley rain

We come alive
When the sun goes down in the valley
We never drive
We just park it out back in the alley

Ch

The moon it shines
And lights up the cans on the dashboard
The stars align
But we don't know exactly what for

The more I see, the less I think I want to see
Which only makes me dare to see
More than I really should
I test myself to show I can endure
Beyond the point of anything that anyone
Has tried to suffer through before

And only the pain remains (sustain, sustain)
Nothing that time can explain away

Like a debt that I never tried to pay before
And no one's ever gonna take
The fee away from me
I try to clear the books with time
Instead of tangible artifacts
And elements and bits of me that I can't see

And only the pain remains (sustain, sustain)
Nothing that time can explain away

And on and on and on and on

4250,"

Standing in the middle of a delicate tension
Got a lot on my mind but not enough to mention
A short attention span and a big imagination
A positive constriction and an obvious affliction

It's a shame It's a shame
Everybody knows it but just the same
It's a shame, it's a shame
You don't want to play my favorite game

School's out of session with a definite obsession
A long forgotten legend and a minor transgression
Are you with me, are you with me, are you with me, are you with me
Dogs that want to bite me and dogs that want to sniff me

It's a shame it's a shame
Everybody does it but no one takes the blame
It's a shame, it's a shame
You don't want to play my favorite game

Cholera, bulimia, insomnia, collateral
A chemical imbalance and a chronic analytical
You can't stand the heat but you still want the sweets
You don't like my mission then get out of my kitchen

It's a shame, etc

There is a place you might wanna go
It's right up my street
You might look and see the light shining
Someone you might like to meet
He said ""let's go for a ride""
Says it all the time
You know you got a lot to live for
And you're gonna be mine
You shouldn't believe the things you reed in papers
They can't come true
I don't believe the things that you see on TV

Don't say I didn't warn you
2 steps forward

If the river runs dry like it probably will
I'll drink from the well 'till I get my fill
If God likes a joke and I think that he may
We'll both be there laughing at the end of the play

What can I tell you?
The way that they sell you
Well, you can strike up the band
With the back of her hand, it's alright

What can I show you
They think that they know you
Well you can wrap up the show
With all that you know, it's alright

If they come looking for me you can tell them dead

8th and Alvarado
I thought I heard bells
McArthur's Park was melting in the dark
But so was everything else

Laid out cold at midnight
Flown like a kite
Hiding in the shadows of love
And searching for night

Uptown, lost and found
Nothing left to find
Because I know that I'm not looking
Then I know that I'm not blind
I'm not looking for an answer
I'm not looking for a sign
""C'mon,"" she said, ""Let's take a look around
Because I want to see what's mine.""

I was thinking of my troubles
As people sometimes will
Everyone who had done my wrong
And those who would wrong me still
And in a fit of desperation
I found myself on my knees
Wishing pain and suffering
On all my enemies

I prayed for loss of limb
And lingering disease
Of blight and devastation
And assorted miseries
But as I made my wishes
And as I cast my spells
I stopped myself and said a prayer
And said these words to myself

There will come a day
There will come a day
When all of the evil
Will be washed away
The patient will be rewarded
And their tormentors will pay
There will come a day, lord
There will come a day

All along you were here despite your absence
Wrote a song to fill you in on what you're missin', Phil
What went wrong? It doesn't matter
The bronze ladder's almost done
We'll climb it later inside the magic crater

4520,"

From small speck of stardust to wondrously sentient
Revolving and spinning in space
Waking and sleeping and yielding to gravity
It starts to show on your face

Millions of forces of physics and providence
Teamed up and brought us all here
Waking and sleeping and yielding to gravity
Pointless to measure in years

Out in the desert your thoughts are as clear as the stars
You feel golden
You're billion year old carbon

In those eighteen years and nine months I've been living here
I always knew there'd come a day when I'd be leaving here
Yes, I know every crevice, I've named them all
There were none too big, there were none too small
If you came to my home you would find me alone with my old dog in the courtyard

I'll buy a plot of land, one full of trees
Where I can practice taxonomy
Me and my old dog we are the same
We go to sleep and we dream of names
It's not a bad life, more like a game
For me and my old dog Namer of Names

I'll buy a plot of land, one full of trees

All of the people are running to the theatre
Forcing themselves with wine
But my body just wished for the one moment
That would sort the questions in his head

And I can't tell in his eyes
If he's gonna cry or if he's gonna fight
And I can't tell in his eyes
If he's gonna cry or if he's gonna fight

Lucky them who spend their summers reading erotics
And watching the kids and cat grow fat
Soon little kid and babies come and their father's forgotten
Cause he only sang a short time
Oh, he could have been a king with a mighty mighty castle
But he's not even half way
And the language he speaks does not soothe them all
So the words start tasting sour

And I can't tell in his eyes
If he's gonna cry or if he's gonna fight
And I can't tell in his eyes
If he's gonna cry or if he's gonna fight

He is finally getting himself of him
He is finally getting himself of her
She is the country that deeply betrayed him
So now he's moving to Spain
Now he's packing his things
All of his belongings

And I can't tell in his eyes
If he's gonna cry or if he's gonna fight
And I can't tell in his eyes
If he's gonna cry or if he's gonna fight

There is no light
There is no light
My eyelids ache from too much darkness
No light save me
The night crave me
Dusty patches to look out for
Cause if we fall we will never rise again

What do we find
In these hell holes
No one loves me when I’m dark full
Dark full, painful
Still I’m empty like a rat
Lying flat in a ditch beside a road

If we fall we will never rise
If we fall we’re gonna rise
If we fall we will never rise
If we fall we’re gonna rise
Again

Singing songs to heal my body
What's left of it?
In red bags?
In weight?

My aching skin
Is the dosing of now
My numb tongue
Is still repeating your name

'Cause I'm a shadow
You're my source
I now need to fade
Die out and get pale
Because you left me in the darkness

On a mountain
I see all the faces
But I only long for yours
On the last train
I meet the railway and I disappear into the night

I am good enough they say
Then I think I'll love and play
But how can I be myself
If I don't have a spirit, a surface, or face?

Without faces showing my mood
Without spirit filling me
The shoe man is not good enough
The human is a woman

Maybe
I'm no ones
I'm no ones
I'm no ones
Maybe, baby
Don't call me
Don't call me
Don't call me that
Nothing

If I don't stop biting my nails

You see baby
Inside is the greatest
Safe things, I can't stop at this
Like a mole I'm blind, I can't see the signs
You see life is a line on a tightrope

Just a little hope is all I need
And I do not jump that bridge
I'll stop fighting, my spirit stop fighting
You see, just a little hope may be everywhere

Adverse effect affect the 10 that might listen
Welcome to the 21st neo-inquisition
Bite your tongue hold you thoughts close to vest
Better yet look for stars that they stitch reading ""projects""
Ironic, we never see ourselves as next prey
What, now we equals cause we have a King's holiday?
Coming storm here to stay
They turned the noon sky heron gray
Africans into slaves
Say we free
But if we speak like Malcolm X then they assassinate
Fate of men on corporate memos
Halos reserved for those who keep status quo
Carry big stick but speak in low tones

Truth festers under scab of lies
We the permanent underclass don't act surprised

Denied access to true wealth
We may have felt the death blow
Again they stole our vocal chords and sold them to the devil
We use to raise our fists now our leadership just settles
Eyes off the ghettos
Keep watching those space shuttles
In midst of this madness it's madmen that win
Even when we vote the opposite it all reverts to Reagan
Silly Christian pagans
Still clutching myths dated back to ancient Babylon
That might unravel dawn
Misconstrued world view used to assault the misinformed kings
That move and act like pawns
Artist's conform and play minstrel
Police State treats our young as criminals
Why pray to Roman death symbols?

Truth festers under scab of lies
We the permanent underclass don't act surprised

Inner City streets still reek of our inner turmoil
Killing melanined equates to X amount of oil
They're telling tall tales to keep our eyes on foreign soil
Hearing truth from poor lips makes their blue blood boil
Play foil to false patriots
Remind youth of '67's race riots
When they learned to keep us quiet
Consumers consuming
Products we are now neither making or using
It only gets more confusing
30% of armed troops are minorities
Casualties directly impact Black and Latin families
If freedom is what we are fighting for, they why'd they swindle Gore?
Imprison most our men and never really outlaw lynching?
The rich get tax breaks, so they are stealing from the pensions of the poor
Who were lured to this land by ideas of better lives
Or tightly packed onto slaveships who's origin historians forever rewrite
Only goal to incite a mental riot
Defiant of airwaves designed to Tailor how I act
I drop the fists and guns and use this tongue to combat

"
4683,

[Verse 1]
I sense this social order in decline
Our people's been assassinated by our own blind
Balance bullets off last vertebrae
Yo gunshots and lyrics if well aimed will reverberate
There's no escape
Your false Jesus promised lies
I'm... serenaded by sincere tears often
The honest only work to afford wooden coffins
Done talking cause it's speech that allows for deceit
This dälek I speak is forever bred in basements
Complacent eyes are the only witness to my changes
Abrasive words slurred with obtuse thought
Caught by the few who do watch
But lost on these blocks

[Chorus]
Breath below gravel
Eyes to form shadows
Despair always ample
Structure's unraveled
Breath below gravel
Eyes to form shadows
Head's nod
But we still living shackled

[Verse 2]
Ample time to sleep once this vein's collapse
Clasp hands in vain attempt to prey upon victims
Asked for incisions to sever chest from mind
Designed from remnants of nightmares broke in sections
Blessings can't save designated slaves
Only answer that remains to subvert whole system
All systems fail
But it's patience that has failed
As our patriarchy's jailed to provide veiled income
None listen I speak with pierced larynx
Addicts move in slow increments within granite
Hands bound and damaged are weapons we brandish
Deemed savage by masses
When this anger's just average

[Chorus]
Breath below gravel
Eyes to form shadows
Despair always ample
Structure's unraveled
Breath below gravel
Eyes to form shadows
Head's nod
But we still living shackled

[Bridge]
That pathetic premise of freedom is false
Futility of earthly flesh answers death's solemn call
Within these very words lie my ancestral tongue
I kept breath within collapsed left lung
As I witnessed modern tower of Babel come undone
These bloodshot eyes surmise that most meaning is lost

[Verse 3]
Lost paradise rots
Vacant lots breed riots
Few men defiant as we tread 'mongst giants
Filthy air of liar fills lung of young lions
Pierced flesh of Mayan bleeds words on papyrus
Desires blurred in tortured minds of the pious
None stand as righteous when judged through this iris
Skin marked by man's iron
Weighted souls wake when well tired
The unsuspected conspire
Brunt smoke from pyre fills night's sky
Should we attempt to walk on water since we all crucified?
These questions denied
Answers just lies
Sanctify history from hands of blind scribes

[Chorus]
Breath below gravel
Eyes to form shadows
Despair always ample
Structure's unraveled
Breath below gravel
Eyes to form shadows
Head's nod
But we still living shackled

[Verse 1]
Terrain disfigured
Pressure temple, tempt to tap trigger
Must contend with this diseased mind and drown liver
Cradle soul eternal type land of two rivers
Considered quite embittered by whole corrupt system
Bled fist in attempt when words weren't heard
Never one to feel blessed beliefs are all blurred
Breath in nocturne
Tone ever somber
Must be meant to wander
Woeful soul won't get conquered
Days none the calmer
No wealth to squander
My lower class stronger
Can't suppress anger
People can't handle
Speak Eastern timbre
Tongue fall like hammer
On those who slander

[Hook]
Success lasts for seconds
Our future's forsaken
(never found reason)
Blatant lies of Bourgeois
(never found meaning)
Seeps into vacant
(Found hatred and despair in breathing)
Eyes out of focus
Only see what they told us
World of weight's on our shoulders

[Verse 2]
Asymmetric hatred only feeds apathetic
Volatile vocals turned thoughts kinetic
Never knew your happiness could just be injected
Belt to clenched jaw teeth hurt all infected
Childhood resurrected
With no mention
We never add time just subtract from life sentence
Why divide God in three sections?
Some find Him uncut in glass vile son, no difference
Frail existence, veiled world depicted
By those still addicted to deities received intravenous
Believers remove pure diction in attempts to deceive us
The last of tacticians
Acts of contrition lost in translation
People lose patience
With words that sound vacant
Atrocities blatant by hands of forsaken
The fortunate find core essence awakened

Spit sacrilege
Blasphemous breath remains accurate
Context of text lost its core concepts
Who speaks our truth?
Convicts or prophets?
Must maintain logic
Who murdered Gnostics?
Fevered mind's slip
Vision off axis
Knowledge kept backwards
Through iris refracted
Light formed of darkness
Sacrifice offered
Throat slit on author
For teaching these paupers
Falsehoods fostered force us to react
Blind faith forms fanatical combat
Speech figured deep as the learned adapt
Papal armies poised for attack, well in fact...
Your precious books written by hands of human
This Christian Jihad will bleed the poor man
Beliefs and ideas can't stand congruent
Morality myths kept the common mind ruined

Chorus:
Opiate masses
Knowledge kept backwards
Religion organized gave rise to ill factors:
Genocide from Genesis to last chapter
Concealed the fact the man Jesus was Black(er)

Manipulated mental
Misguided myths
You pray to crossed sticks and nails through each wrist
Discard that true gift
Truth still elusive
Illusions used to strip strength from last human
Past omen's looming
Awake the dead
Misread basic meaning, best left unsaid
What sanity?
Sift though soul hold to thread
Did missionaries wield swords or break bread?
Your holy books only increase bloodshed
Those holy books only increase bloodshed
From first moments they moved to subdue populous
Pagan beliefs interweave to form doctrine
Ironic when you speak of heresy
These priests can't even see their own diseased fraternity
So fuck that sour wine and stale wafer
Your pale portrait of a hippie could never be my savior

Chorus:
Opiate masses
Knowledge kept backwards
Religion organized gave rise to ill factors:
Genocide from Genesis to last chapter
Concealed the fact the man Jesus was Black(er)

Bridge:
The role of religion in the domination and the destruction
Of African civilization
Is so shameful...
No matter how you look at it, the picture is negative
Because all of them did more harm than good
All of them made their God.... Ungodly

Opiate masses
Knowledge kept backwards
Religion organized gave rise to ill factors:
Genocide from Genesis to last chapter

[Verse 1]
Written word held weight
Now honor at best recessive trait
The sound and shape to come succumbed to Malignant maelstrom
Malformed mentals stained expected outcome
And not to be outdone
Some speak in half phrases
No definition to brush strokes already out of phase with these statements
Raise children off pavement...
Pulse on frauds hasten
When confronted with styles from gutter basements
Set to build like Freemasons, on three angles
All I see are Minstrel MC's on these channels
Perceived battles only held to sell albums
Propagate stereotypes that bleed out us
Our own doubt us
But I remain devout scholar of skills of forefathers
Ignorance was forced on us
Define honest, if we all breath diseased lies
Define the MC if all he spits are weak lines

[Chorus]
Who trades his culture for dollars?
The fool or the scholar?
Griot? Poet? Or White collared?

[Post-Chorus]
If my written words slurs
Then my speech correct
Keep my meaning inferred to test your intellect
If you remember hip-hop nigga 'nuff respect
Deadverse spoken with broken dälek

[Verse 2]
Spoken word held meaning
Hostile acts provoked
Formed metaphors
Created urban folklore
Never meant for these upper echelon aurals
That bought and stripped morals
From art that's gift for us
At heart I'm strict purist
Spit thoughts for poorest
5'6'' Honduran sights set on own ruin
Rugged cadence meant to capture essence
Ancestor's wrath festers under surface of uttered sentence

What about synchronized swimmin’ in the fountain?
Watch me shufflin’ head buttin the pavement
Hopscotch in stereo gettin cross faded
I don’t need a Mrs, just a casual engagement
So why ‘onchya ask your momma to go and make the arrangements
I’ll be in my lightning wick, makin’ it rain man
I’m R kelly. My room. Like caveman
Punchin’ mile high club cards like a plane can
Sittin’ cross legged meditatin’ in the caymans

Lots, lots better
Way, way, way better
You hurt my feelings more than once
And made me feel bad more than twice
I thought if I made you jealous
You might want me more or treat me better
One million kisses for one million girls
And no kisses left for you
One million kisses for one million girls
And I did it all for you
It didn't work out like I had planned
You didn't even care
You didn't treat me any better
But I don't even care
One million kisses for one million girls
And no kisses left for you
One million kisses for one million girls
And I did it all for you
And me

What I thought was just a matter of conscience
Turned out to be a matter of luck
And what I should've done was just a matter of time
Turned out to be my dumb luck

[Chorus]
Oh, Nicole told me
Oh, Nicole told me
Oh, Nicole told me
And I now know that she was right

Last night I did a foolish thing and
I now regret it
The word is out and so am I
And I know that she won't forget it

[Chorus]

I had a strange feeling
Like all this had happened before
Right down to the smallest detail
Just like it had all happened before

[Chorus]

I was told there are good things to come
For those who will wait
And it sounded so good, the way that she said it
Oh, I just couldn't wait

[Chorus]

The first thing I saw was her face
And then I saw her back
And after I had seen her eyes
Well, I knew that she would not come back

[Chorus]

So some set out to get out
And do their own thing
End of the great credibility race
But the ego e-coli
Spreads equally:
End of the great credibility race
Major or minor
D.I.Y. or 3The Man2
End of the great credibility race
You can't kill
Stupid stardom scams
End of the great credibility race

So here's to the ones
That just wanna play
That set out to get out
And do their own thing
The rules they shift
But they stay the same
Thrift store theatrics
And four track recorders
Powered by trust funds
Of guilty prodigals
The checkered flag's white
At the end of the great credibility race

You can dare fate like a matador
End of the great credibility race
Have sympathy for all the dropped combos
End of the great credibility race
Touch on jazz and go prove you're a honky white man
End of the great credibility race
Kill all the rock starts 'til you're a start for the act
End of the great credibility race

I wasn't built to spill
I ain't no no modest mouse
I roar like a lion
And I don't miss a drop
Life's too short
For all this fucking crap
Before you know you're at your crypt
Reading your epitaph

I isolate amino acids sometimes
I bottle them and sell them when the sun shines
Cold sores erupt if you don't keep lysine levels healthy
A tingle on your lip, should come and see me

Many foods are rich in arginine
Concentrate on the ones with more lysine
Highest levels of all in margarine

My attitude of sorrow for the dead man
Was hidden by my interest in his great plan
His dying 4/4 gasp withdrew his wait from the game
Now listening posts in Fnac will carry my name

An obiturary by Mr. Toop
Now he's gone there's one less laptop loop
With your help this time 'round I might recoup

Wanna be bright but I confess I never cared
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
A pee-chee stained with drool is lying on the stairs
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
Feet don't move any other way
Arms lie still, eyes begin to glaze
And just last night I heard my baby say
Terminal boredom, boredom
Tell me something dumb or something cute over the telephone
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
I need to be distracted, I don't want to be alone
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
Can't stay fixed, every single day
Boredom creeps, ain't even afraid
And I'm not sure that I care anyway
Terminal boredom, boredom
Ain't nothing on the radio, no hope
But that stupid band called chemical
Oh what a mope
Maybe I'm a dildo, don't wanna know
For never seeing past the patio
And is it even curable?
Beat the bastards, give 'em hell or better yet
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
Do it in person not just on the t.v. set
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
My hair's clean but goo is on my sheets
Terminal boredom, terminal boredom
An hour goes by and... uuuuuugggghhhhrrraaaiizgggg
Legs lie still, they don't even shake
What do I need to do to be awake
To be outdoors and chatting with the fakes
Terminal boredom, boredom

Subterranean maintain own tongue mongst ruins
In subdued tones I speak of the flesh which entombs our inner core
Who the blessed? Invade airwaves type Moors (wars)
Sore from travels to unmarked thresholds, grapple truths untold lying in whispers it figures
He who snickers doesn't see final melody
Shattered splinters, melodic in their own unrest
Remind me of Osiris, made liars of us all
For 364 days I learned to crawl
Appalled by sense of urgency to resurrect the dead
Shed my last skin searching for angel with broken wing
Will she sing that e minor hymn? For those of us who sin?
For those of us who sin?
Within dirty sanctum became brethren's anthem
Jesus Christ a Black man walks the earth still
Forgot to speak the real, Struggle's fate not sealed
I appeal to nil, never one, not one, none

Amplify brainwaves to condense my thought
Bends the dark
Why question my art?

Shunned by rays of Amon Ra
Darkness exposes every soul's flaw
I forever remain raw, unpolished
Drunk off knowledge of knowing I'm dumb
Now remain none's sum, while inner eyes' stay numb
We all shall succumb to eternal sleep
For now I'll just yawn and speak on ill gutter beats
Watch falling leaves, walk on knees
Down graveled path vocalize own epitaph
Evoke on path towards inner, nonlinear
Lay head mongst sinners
Solitude falls winter
Appalled at visual surrounding
Kept my bearings non-grounded
Liquid language kept frozen 40 oz's
How many Mc's know who Faust is?
Pardon original, Manuscript fit text type tailored suit
Felt effects at root through vein type heron' you shoot
Euphoric, saw banks of Tigris and Euphrates
Fertile Crescent hold more lessons than taught by deities
Consciousness is leaving me
Seen that same sage turn page on habitual
Perform tectonic rituals
Broke abacus to calculate coordinates
But can't afford rent.... It makes no sense
Forgot our days in shackles? You concentrate on battles?
I lecture graduates discussing Kant till they leave baffled

Amplify brainwaves to condense my thought
Bends the dark
Why question my art?

Sat amongst wise kings Indian-style
Witnessed the birth of the 1st child in exile
On banks of Nile
Grew seeds of post destruction
Juveniles lack such instructions
As so-called truths rattle such assumptions
Oneness of polyrythmic shifts into....
Nothing
Suburbanite tikes slumming for trend
Humanity pretends to be humane
Urbanscape fails to sustain


Rain falls upon my weary brow
Shrugged shoulders of indifference speak


Swollen tongue bums with smoke filled lungs
Swollen tongue bums with smoke filled lungs
Acoustic warfare on masses like Iranians


Dig them sounds god, lost my way again
Walk through vineyard
Concept nonlinear
Spoke, pattern broke, caused view past millennia
Messiah cry timber
Marble columns crumble under feet of us sinners
Felt my eyes stabbed with splinters
In blindness felt contours of unsure terrain
Populus lay slain
I offer malted grain to the unwise sage


Strange intrinsic
World got me lifted
Skilled drunken mystic
Felt my earth shifted


Swollen tongue bums with smoke filled lungs
Swollen tongue bums with smoke filled lungs
Acoustic warfare on masses like Iranians


Suburbanite tikes slumming for trend
Humanity pretends to be humane
Urbanscape fails to sustain


Inconsistent simple peasants of next week
Chew slow as you weep
There are no grapes left to harvest
Drunkard wash away old thoughts in midst of lazy yawns
Oh how we fear the dawn and the sharp pains which twinge our insides
My night has ended
Morning amounts to crust caked eyes and regrets
Forgetting what it is we are


Swollen tongue bums with smoke filled lungs
Swollen tongue bums with smoke filled lungs
Acoustic warfare

Within my turmoil lies no answers
nonsense in sentence spoke backwards
tired of cowards.
Worldview soured by hypocritical cynics
listen to my lyrics before discounting validity
you never been no kin to me
I see through your papier-mache mask so clearly
Yes, fear me.
you never seen this thought pattern,
though my gear may appear tattered,
your whole way of life I plan to shatter
Sick of sub-species brain matter controlling airwaves
Weak-minded walk brainwashed in haze
I pray for the last days.

I disintegrate visual plain, battlefield to remain in mental
your attempts to rhyme are inconsequential
I met you halfway and remain empty-handed
Never forgot that the Beast is branded
I communicate to ancients in Sanskrit
Elicit use of drums to conjure a false god
I move herds of these so-called Mc's with cattle prods
So now I sob for my corpse-culture
Nicely packaged for the corporate vultures
you call me vulgar but I'm just a shadow of society,
Not your commodity.
Peace to the last true: ODDATEEE,
Let us wander aimlessly,
My idols sell their asses shamelessly.
I pray for the day of the megaton.

I saw a man yesterday
Snub-nosed . 38 to temple test his fate
And lose
I had the same new balance shoes
I wonder what size? (x4)

[Verse 1: MC Dälek]
City gates long abandoned, hit ill chord type hammond b-3
Mind altered state changes scenery
This all seems to be average hip-hop
Watch as noise-floor drops into recesses and crevasses
As whoever attempts to be my nemesis
Guesses wrong as to meaning of this song
Bygone be bygones, why prolong the inevitable conclusion
Career choice was illusion
Mc's need skill transfusion for using
Radio friendly format
Predictable attack
Fragile as hemophiliacs
I extract essence intact
Speak to face of anglo-saxons
With no weapons
I'm that kid you slept on
Bottled my aggression
Concise paragraphs is window sills to life
Niggas feeling nice on corner blocks
As soapbox preachers speak on christ
Religion and ism is just vice
Dull mental gives them sharper knife
Gouging out our eyes
Realize what be lies
And why our babies cry

I saw a man yesterday
Snub-nosed . 38 to temple test his fate
And lose
I had the same new balance shoes
I wonder what size?

[Verse 2: MC Dälek]
Desensitized, dwell on inkwell
Got inebriated off the blood of those i hated
In past lives
Nines reloaded by bloated officers snorting nine lines
Equation sublime
In 4/4 time, key of d
Classical poet, present day mc
Hit your cells like hennesy
Expound boundaries like timothy leary
Mind's journey got you weary
Couldn't digest this spoken theory
Why your eyes teary?
Impaired vision so i speak in infrared verbs
Severed nerves pulsing morse coded pain
Silent syllables form words as rain wash away
Worldwide chinese torture, cries of my culture
Keeps my nocturnal insomnia intact
Assaults alter random attacks
As you react to my act on 1st take
Like roberta flack
Deep within the realms of this knapsack
Lie scripted scrolls and cuneiform clay tablets
Form sumarian prophets
Unlock it

I saw a man yesterday
Snub-nosed . 38 to temple test his fate
And lose
I had the same new balance shoes
I wonder what size?

Galvanized loose ends tied
Form electrical jungle vines
Keeping paths from hindsight
Loose ends galvanized
Wander wondering at twilight

Basic blocks to breath topple under bare bleeding feet
Wince at stabbing pain in left lobe as mighty sword's unsheathed
Source of all life lies in East, the source of all life lies in East
Feel the rumble of them bombed trains, third railed from beneath
I walk with tattered scrolls on these ill lonely streets
Babble last true tongue, could give a fuck where you from
Travel torn path, swung as pendulum
Now my thread of life's come undone
Remember back when Uzi's weighed a ton?
Now every kid's got one
Dipped in platinum bathed in aggression
Succumb to last temptation
Lost all my patience
Peace to last bastion:
Afrika... Zulu nation
Lyrics laced with oils from inner works of mental reservoir
The world in ill discord
Pray to ancient ancestors
Pray to ancient ancestors

Remember days of cardboard, fat lace, and krylon?
Microphones and twelves, tools we all relied on
Niggas dropped a verse, the thought was one to die on
I remember hip hop, that's my Mt. Zion

Bygones be bygones so many souls wore thin
My world lies in famine, I wander with kinsmen
Through dismal slums of ignorance
Wash my hands in pool of absolution
Keep warm with torn blanket of revolution
Quite useless shut one's eyes once realized
You glide through this darkness
Embark upon this, solom crusade to save the only gift our God gave
The curse is manmade, designed to turn blessed to slaves
Forgave the weak minded two weeks into journey
Again travel untraveled road on scrapped knee
Broke bread with those bums who taught speech
In attempt to reach nirvana
Ye of poor karma
None calmer in old age, young sage turn page on brittle text
There's no time left
What must I stress?
Demons colorless, infest our own earth
Immersed in tainted dirt
Could never quite quench my own thirst for ancient drums
There lies a language in the noise and the hum
Prepare for martyrdom, prepare for martyrdom
I speak that ancient tongue
There lies a language in (the noise and the hum)

Remember days of cardboard, fat lace, and krylon?
Microphones and twelves, tools we all relied on
Niggas dropped a verse, the thought was one to die on
I remember hip hop, that's my Mt. Zion

Lost equilibrium, wish I fell to '85
Verbal vagabond blessed for being blind
Etched my paradigm in Sanskrit at age nine
So why these kids swear to God I'm unrefined?
Still swig from sacred liquid language
Poor as fuck but seem to manage
Non average urban savage
You living lavish when this world is pure survival
Best you hide in the corners of your mind for sitting idle
Breathing air is vital
You pray to false idols
No feelings in recitals when you only search for titles
Feel so suicidal, but couldn't give you joy
Four elements of this only for the B-boys (B-girls)

Who you pray to, my God the brown God?
Who you pray to, my God the white God?
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod

[Verse 1]
I wear skin like Jesus
Sick of bullshit preachers
Concerned with aborted fetus
But don't give a fuck who feeds us
Speech so tedious
If Abraham freed us
Why there still Abner Louima's?
Been slaves since days of Julius Caesar
Man's need to dominate overshadows need to breath
Pray to your pagan gods while your twisting all those trees
Scraped knees don't prove what you believe
Your blind faith passed to your seeds
Killed our garden type weeds
Turn around and blame it on Eve
While you blame me for blemishing our family tree
I'll uproot all of humanity

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sick of true blasphemy
Religion pure alchemy
And gold lines no lead streets
Blessed are the meek who reek in honesty
True green lie in botany
They're hawking me from high atop the food chain
Deciding who to blame for each and every heartless act
Weight of elements exact
I retain no tact and spit the pure fact
Mixed with blood from split tongue
Collapsed lung only help to breath diseased atmosphere
Expect me to adhere to your bullshit code of silence
Speak till dawn of violence
They say no man's an island...
I’ve watched the youth
These kids is wildin'

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Cause i love you and i love you
Andi really hate to go
Cause i realize it so
You and me

Pourquoi je ne peux pas
Ã^crire un chant patriotique?
Un chant Ã notre gloire Ã tous
Pas juste Ã la gloire de toi?
Des dÃ©s, des dÃ©mos et des cracks
Jouer Ã s'Ã©viter, s'inviter, s'effrayer
Ce n'est pas du passÃ©
C'est pas si loin, Ã§a va venir
Il ne s'est rien passÃ©
Cette vie-lÃ est un danger
Pourquoi pas des mots durs
Des mots de haine et de colÃ¨re?
Pas des mots doux, des mots d'amour?
Il ne s'agit plus de toi, le trois
Gueule de bois et matin noir
Nous ne sommes rien Ã deux
RÃªves en croix
Le monde entier nous en veut
Des clefs, des hÃ©ros et des frasques
Jouer Ã dÃ©montrer, Ã s'Ã©viter, s'inviter
Des clefs, des hÃ©ros et des frasques
Jouer Ã s'Ã©puiser, Ã s'Ã©viter, s'inviter
Ce n'est pas du passÃ©
C'est pas si loin, Ã§a va venir

[Verse 1]
Everything change & we'll all change again
Sun sheds the light as the life sheds its skin
You kiss your wish to the heart of the world
Secrets are safe with, will not break the spell

Come on, lets go home
Buried in your womb
Sing a song of death
Til' there's none left

[Hook]
Love comes close
But chooses to spare me
Death comes close
But ceases to take me
I want to twist, the knife a bit deeper
To siphon the love from the hearts I believed in
Look outside, world is exploding
Stay inside, still never knowing
Taking cover, with each other
Sleeping off the century of hope

[Verse 2]
Everydays changing will remain the same
Silhouettes shy as rain rots the drain
Everydays decay debases the dream
The ghosts that will haunt you are not what they seem
Still you say you're dead
To depravity
But that can't be true, cause I know you can hear me

[Hook]

And sometimes the people are quite interesting
And sometimes they arn't
And sometimes we meet
And sometimes we talk
And sometimes we don't
And sometimes we do
And sometimes we please each other
And sometimes we tease each other
And sometimes there's cameras
And sometimes there's blindfolds

And sometimes there's handcuffs
And sometimes there's freedom
And sometimes they're men
And sometimes they're women
And sometimes they're both
And sometimes they're ghosts

[Erick Sermon]
Erick Sermon's in the house

Let's get up, let's get down
Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin' Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation-
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

[Hook]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do

The crossover

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do

[Parrish Smith]
The rap era's outta control, brother's sellin' their soul
To go gold, going, going, gone, another rapper sold
(To who) To pop and R&B, not the MD
I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin' on they fans, they ill
Trying to chill, saying ""damn, it be great to sell a mill!""
That's when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large!)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

[Hook]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do

Crossover

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do

[Erick Sermon]
(So whatcha sayin) You wanna go pop goes the weasel
You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diesel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MCs duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me
(Hit Squad) yea, P, hit me

[Parrish Smith]
Another megablast funky dope style from cross yonder
(So help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda)
(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say, ""There's no business like show business,""
But if that's the truth, please explain why is this:
Rap has been around long, makin' mad noise you see
Still I haven't seen one rapper livin' comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover
I stick to underground, keep the crossover

[Hook]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do

Crossover

Whatever you want

I wanna do it for you, I do

Slow down baby uhh
Slow down baby uhh

You can get rugged, though, hard like P
Trying to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot to comp rapper on a quest
You get your head flown, boy you must be smokin' sens
So many often wonder if MDs paid
You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way
'Cause I clock Gs while you clock Zs
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke M.C.s
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take notes
A rapper suffred from bleeding, sprains and slit throats
My style deadly psychopath or schizophrenic
Rapper choke like a curburetor, freeze up, and panic
'Cause I clock pesos, don't sell ileyo
Another name for cocaine, mi amigo
That's Spanish terminology for friend
Now sit back and rub my bozack as I send
Bass funk with beats that thump
Kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk
My system cranking, my headlights are blinkin'
Brother ridin' my tip, L, at the same time thinkin'
Damn, how could a brother be so nice
'Cause I'm the capital E-P twice M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite
While you were bangin' on tables, I was bangin' Snow White

Yeah slow down baby

The ripper, the master, the overlordian
Playing M.C.s like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from a necessary station
Them sayin' I was vacationin'
You can't cope with your weak-ass throat
Tryin' 'a sneak a peak in while I freak the notes
Major M.C.s become minor B flats
So retire the mike, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, gettin' your stance
I'm 'a shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're quilty, face down on the pavement
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real god
The undertaker droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mike down slow and careful
'Cause mine is fully loaded and I have another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin' punks a whippin'
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds and so
I'm down so that you clowns will know
Me gettin' burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the (huh) forget it, I'm constipated

Yeah slow down baby

When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget
I master on the beat down, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security is packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any whack M.C. that flexes, I'm creamin' 'em
Not with lotion, bust the motion, flotation
When I'm rockin' the mike I'm like coastin'
Underneath fatigue at my peak
You still seek the style 'cause yours is extra weak
New method, rip the stage at my age and get loose and kick
Like Bruce in a rage-I'm on a rampage

Yeah slow down baby
Slow down baby

[Erick Sermon]
Uh-huh
Yeah, aww yeah, uhh ""Richter Scale""
It goes lights, camera, action I'm on
One more time to kill em, my rap flow is fulfilling
I scream with the Beastie Boys -- What time is it?
It's two o'clock, you gettin knocked out the box
Then kicked off the block, Def Squad Hit Squad
No we won't stop, fuck it call the cops (uh-huh)
I be the invincible, in the school of hard knocks
I'm the principal, Fatman Joe y'know

[Parrish Smith]
As you suffer the repercussions, comin through the blaze
Bust the crime scene, cause some drama, niggas duckin
When we come through, throwin the jab, in the one-two
Layin MC's out to trap, when we run through (like what?)
Like the marathon, flooded with the diamonds on
Get my rhymin on, PMD fuckin shinin on
Back to Biz, new address with the fat crib
My shit in the Wiz, poli'-in with the big wigs

Chorus: Erick Sermon

Off the meter, and everytime we reach the
Tip-top and ya don't stop, uhh!
In the field of rap, we pull rank no question
We top the ""Richter Scale""
*repeat 2X*

[Erick Sermon]
Bust the techniques, E.D. fantastic
Unreal GangStarr shit, Mass Appeal
Rap's top dawg, I'm the one you call on
To get Sic'-Wid-It, E don't forget it
I'm six, two and a half, heavyset, chocolate brown
Hell of a jab, gift to gab
I'm the elite, keep it underground like street level
I rock a Rolex watch, with a diamond bezel

[Parrish Smith]
Rap terror terror, EPMD, a new era
Off the richter scale, blowin hotter than ever
With the Squadron, beg your pardon, got the heads noddin
Lost your mind and said, ""Shit!!"" when we barged in
The front door door, rugged, keeps our shit raw raw
Make hits for the fans, plus the world tour
Believe that, peep that E and P's back
Wreckin heads daily, so chill and Get the Bozack

Chorus

[Erick Sermon]
Yo Royal Flush-in, all my cats be bustin
Servin you Customers and those fake hustlers
Whassup? Step to me, I smack you silly
I'm the Kid, but no comparison to Billy
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers -- can't you tell?
Girls lose to me when they groove to Maxwell, uhh
I got one life to live so I'm livin
Got girls to be hittin more cars to be drivin

[Parrish Smith]
We stripped too many beats to make too many niggas to break
No moves are fake, no warnin shots fired blastin on crews like corrupt Jakes
The Black Viper, scream on MC's and rhyme cyphers
More Dangerous Mind than, Michelle Pfeiffer
So skedaddle-daddle, you get rattled don't wanna battle-battle
Put one to your rhyme saddle, stompin through, like wild cattle
We flow beef so dead that, let that shit cease
I'm quick with the hands, plus accurate with the two-piece

It's a fact, I'm mad hard like a jail yard
I'm sick, slow, call me a retard
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin
Dark as hell, hear water drippin
Parrish Smith, mentally sick
Serial rap killer like Dave Berkowitz
Yes, the son of Sam and I'll be godamn
So take the force and get the balls and watch me slam, man
The exquisite rap wizard from the boon dox
My tune knock watts, been known to cause brain lock
Wit no riff raff, smooth like Shaft
Breaking bones in the rap zone, chill or get smoked mad fast
Can't stop us from buggin because we're trippin
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin

(Chorus)
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin(4x)

(Erick Sermon)
Breaker 1, 9, breaker, 1, 9, mayday
Call for backup, it's Erick Sermon's payday
No illusion, just mass confusion
Dull raps, I dutch them, from the funk production
I, the Afro American, black citizen
To make you scream loud as hell like Sam Kinison
No one can stop me
Dun na na na na na, like Rocky
The combination, the jab, the uppercut
Mad footwork from the rappin' expert
Bust a move, I'm worth about a million cash bucks
Say what, damn right, shut the hell up
I fought MC's word up and watch em grown up
Play em like Dunkin, then pass out doughnuts
Then I freak the funky style and I use it
MD and hear nothing but the music

Chorus

(PMD)
What's this, another funky hit from the Squad, kid
I get mad props like Sonny Crockett
You know it's the smooth rap flow that clocks the P doe
Can't stop now (why) cuz I'm diesel
EPMD back in effect on your rap set
Fourth cassette, more deadly than a bomb threat
Can't stop us from buggin because we're trippin
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin

(Erick Sermon)
Slate take two, action, the main attraction
(Who's Bad) I'm bad like Michael Jackson
Got more tricks than any Kung Fu flick
Understand, I'm ruff and tuff like Jackie Chan
My technique, the drunken mic, grasp it right
I'm teaching (P-S-Y-C-H-E) psyche
I'm slammin, the dopest nigga from the underground
Out the basement, now world renown
Rocking systems, cuss and jock a victim
If we catch flack from a punk and then we diss him
Then I freak a funky style and I use it
Kid, and hear nothing but the music

Yeah, to them cats out there hustlin' them demos
Keep the faith, keep hustlin', knahmean E?
[E] Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
[P] I'mma lace em like this, check it

Verse One: Parrish Smith

I was coolin' in my car one day you see
Clockin' a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin', the fingers start to snappin'
E now was coolin', Brooklyn spirits we was snappin'
Comin' in and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin' in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin' system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
A meeting at twelve, and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And alls we kept sayin' was please listen to my demo
(listen to my demo)

Please listen to my demo (3X)
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

Verse Two: Erick Sermon

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
Then I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin'
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played it for Will Soc' and the Sleeping Bag staff
People start to smile, inside we buckwhylin'
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin'
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo G, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was lovey-dovey
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos
And I wanted was somebody, to listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Listen to my demo
Listen to my demo
Demo, d-d-d-d-demo, demo, d-d-demo
Demo, demo, hah, Millennium Ducats, peace

And I can't get my hands around it

I licked the blood and I stopped to nap
And I dream

Oh there you are at the magic theater
Black dress, hands up, in the air
Well I've heard

Time to time, thought I'd seen it

Oh the show is over, everybody's gone
The air was cool, and the pines were long
And draped down, from the blackness
Mmm mmm mm mmm

Oh you saw my coffin and got right in

I sing the blues most every night
And i wait for the one i lost
He snuck into my secret files
And he read my mind
He belongs to someone
I know how she spells her name
I'll consider another day
Without the one i love
Without the one i love
Aloneâ€¦

He no longer loves me
I'm supposed to forget about him
I was just a harbor
A temporary love
A temporary love
On loanâ€¦

I think i know what's on his mind
And i'll try to be satisfied
He sneaks around my secret life
And he wrote me down
Someone else will help him
I'll pretend to forget the past
I'll look for a love that lasts
A love that never dies
A love that never dies

So close your eyesâ€¦
Close your eyesâ€¦

There is no comfort so
Familiar as the silence
Inasmuch as we touch
We understand each other

As for us we've become
Surrounded by the silence
Refugees from our dreams
We didn't dare surrender

I would not love for naught
He never seemed to feel it
Sometimes i wish that i
Could be content without counting

Still my words won't be heard
Above the crowd i'm playin'
And my words stand unheard
They'll disappear to silence

I don't know why I'm stayin' with you
If everything they're sayin' is true
I heard about you lyin' to your mama, baby
And I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

Words don't hardly even matter
When nothin' seems to satisfy your mind
Trust is ready to find
Do you think you can make it to tomorrow

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then i'll know what to do about you
As always my wanderin' mind
Takes me right down
To the bottom of the basement

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then i'll know what to do about you
Whenever you decide what you're wantin' baby
Then I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

Plans don't hardly even matter
When everybody's messin' with your mind
Love is ready to find
Do you think you can make it to tomorrow

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then i'll know what to do about you
As always my wanderin' mind
Takes me right down
To the bottom of the basement
I'm wanderin', I'm a wanderin' child
Goin' right down
To the bottom of the basement

First was the wolf and the wilds and the will
And the rule of the mid-realm king
Long was the night when the wolf pack was still
In their wait for the gathering spring

Soft was the face of the deep-hidden flower
That bloomed in the whispering wood
Strong was the sight of the heaven's red eye
When the dawn was the scarlet of blood

Then came the ship to the ice-ridden shore
That carried the northern star
Proud indeed was the banner they bore
That flew from the uppermost spar

Many a back built the citadel wall
That grew on the banks of the leer
Loud was the sounding of destiny's call
For those with the wisdom to hear

Up leapt the spark that ignited the rain
Of Septentria's flint and steel
Deep were the secrets the dwarf smith could name
And the cauldron of gold could reveal

Dear was their sister who guided the Skraels
In the lands of the easterly dawn
Steep were the banks of the river of years
When their duty was finally done

Strong is the pull of a name for your home
And a heritage all can share
Old was the wisdom the bard had once shown
Who had founded the land of the hare

Thoughtful the moot and the future they saw
And the hope they agreed to declare
Gold and the pattern on history's loom
Were the threads they were measuring there

So spread the dream like a hungering flame
Over Ealdormere's towns and fields
Fated were they who would carry the name
And the weight of the champion's steel

But for the symbols in copper and hide
That encircled their necks like a wreath
Great was their promise as Ealdormere's pride
But their stewardship doomed to be brief

A warlord arose in the far southern land
That spoke of a northern threat
Artless the fall of his iron-clad hand
And the turns of their servitude set

Heavy the heart of the conqueror's son
The northerner's knew as a friend
Dark were the skies with a gathering storm
As he told them their freedom would end

Then with the heat came the summons to war
And they followed the warlord's son
Proudly they shouldered the burdens they bore
And the praise for the battles they won

Silent the war cries and tongue-less the bards
As they toiled in the sand and the mud
Loudly their discipline spoke of the land
That whispered its name in their blood

Still their were two who embodied the north
Champions in all but name
Low burn the embers of Ealdormere's hearth
The seeds of a slumbering flame

Moved by her courage, they fought for the doe
Proudly they stood in her guard
Slow went that harvest and small was its yield
And for many the winter was hard

Heard from the south road the hills of the spring
With news of a tourney won
Many did wonder what summer would bring
With the conqueror's dynasty done

Solemn that dragon proclaimed in his heart
That the law of the land should read hence
""That any who challenged the name of the north
Would answer the steel of its prince.""

And so was the title of Ealdormere's lord
Assumed by the southron king
Great was the voice of the wolves of the north
Who were given the freedom to sing

White were the blooms of the trillium flower
They gathered and raised in their hearts
Scarlet the bonfires that burned through the night
That were seen from the cities and farms

"
6585,
6586,
6587,
6589,

The last of the Southron, the Otter and Briar
Saw Ealdormere prove its worth
Sagely they called for a Tournament Grand
To determine the Prince of the North
A new Knight defeated the Champion of old
With Prowess both nimble and sure
Certain were they upon seeing his face
That the Line of the North was secure

Singing they joined in the thundering host
That fought for the Midrealm Kings
Fearless the might of the Wolfpack at war
With the valor that leadership brings
Sharp were the blades of the triple-edged flower
That struck its foes down where they stood
Fierce was the light of the Heaven's red eye
When the fields were the scarlet of blood

Upon this foundation their arms would reach wide
And the Northrealm would leave it's mark
Powerful Monarchs would sail with the tide
And would shine like a flame in the dark
Ealdormere's people were giving and Kind
Each head of pavilion or hall
Had no greater pride for a stranger or friend
But to give them their best and their all

So Ealdormere grew to a thoroughbred's strength
From the first eager steps of a colt
The needs of a Kingdom were pondered at length
And none could find Ealdormere's fault
Officers, artisans, wisdom and youth
And nobles of every degree
Women and men full of chivalry's grace
Who could lead them in war and in peace

Like bees in the summer, the fever took hold
For much there was yet to be done
The newest of nobles joined Shirefolk of old
In their dreams of a future to come
The humblest peasant stood equal to Peer
As the shape of their work was revealed
Surely the mightiest keep had been built
From the stones that were found in the field

And so came the day when the doors were thrown wide
To the wondrous hall they built
Drawn like a river they gathered inside
'Til the greatest of chambers was filled
Eyes were drawn upward and whispers were hushed
At the sight of the scarlet-draped throne
Their dream in fruition, the moment at hand
For a King and a Queen of their own

In song-softened silence the populace stood
And the will of the land intoned
Sweet was the harvest that grew from the past
When the seeds of the future were sown
Soft was the shining of Ealdormere's eyes
Who gathered to witness a birth
Bright was the legacy's circle that passed
From the first to the last to the first

And so
First is the wolf
And the Wilds
And the Will
And the Rule
Of the Northrealm King

When you’re alone the night seems so vast
Look to the sky
Enter the void
There is a light at the end of the world
Drawn down the path
To cross the land
Bound to the flesh
Bound to this world
Alone in the dark as life slips away
There is a light at the end of the world
Drawn down the path
To cross the land
I see the fall
I see the end
I watch it fade
In this blood red tide

Golden eyes the crimson path
Judge me now as I embrace the fall
Golden eyes staring down at me
The cold embrace my blood runs dry
Our world lays shattered
Our dreams lay broken
Pride armor of the dead
Pride armor of the dead

She is an echo lost in the void
Echo in a perfect world
Unknown in the dark
Behind the tree line

Descends into the dark

Filled with Secrets
Her image fades
She speaks to me
Lost in the void
She calls to me

Divine the scorn with serpent eyes
Born in the sun, live by the moon
Held with shadows dark embrace
Visions
Haunt my mind
Visions of Shadows
Plague my mind
I see the light
I watch them fall
Cancer in their hearts
Cancer in their hearts

Bury the sun in the western sky
Old fields will fail and cities burn
Like dreams like visions I had
Like dreams from long ago
The ravens fly as death descends
The gods of war show no remorse
Our lives crushed by the wheel
In our hearts we know it's true
Buried all in shallow graves
In death our hearts are true
In death we have no name
In death our hearts are true
In death we have no name

Yes, yeah we're movin' on
Looking for direction
Mmm mm we've covered much ground
Thinking back to innocence
I can no longer connect
I don' t have a heart left to throw around

Oh, and time moves on like a train
That disappears into the night sky
Yeah, I still get a sad feeling inside to see the red tail lights wave goodbye

We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together
And this love will never
This old love will never die

Well money slips into your hands
And then slips out like it was sand
And those shoes that you could never seem to fill
I've chased so much and lost my way
Maybe a face for every day
That so casually slipped me by

Oh, and time moves on like a train
That disappears into the night sky
Yeah, I still get that sad feelin' inside to see the red tail lights wave goodbye

We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together
And this love will never
This old love will never die

Morning comes
Sometimes with a smile
Sometimes with a frown
Yeah so I never want to worry
If you're gonna stay around

So let's grow old together
We'll grow old together
And this love will never
This old love will never die

Yes, yeah we're movin' on
Movin' right along

Oh feels like autumns back again so soon
I see my father turning grey under a silver moon
Dont remember when
He was a young man anymore
Well thats too long ago
Suddenly Id be asking you
If you'll love me all the time
Even when the diamond loses its shine
Whoa whoa yeah
The heaviness of loss
The weightlessness of a baby boy
The despair and imminent joy
You know temptation only shows yer one side of its face
Gotta make sure you see the other before you join the rat race
Dont know why Im so happy to take care of you
But Ive learnt to go with the flow
And thats what the flow wants to do
So I dont need to tell you do I my girl
That you are sunshine you're everything good in a world
Well you know I'm thinking about myself less and less
Only holler if its SOS
Taking bigger steps to get to you
Happy to sit her and watch you and I grow
And bathe in this sweet autumn flow
You know temptation only shows yer one side of its face
Gotta make sure you see the other before you join the rat race
Dont know why I'm so happy to take care of you
But Ive learnt to go with the flow
And thats what the flow wants to do

In every word you say
But we make love forever still
And I'll not fill that space
By punching all your front teeth out
And laughing in your face

She's swingin' Thor's Hammer, maybe sick of your manners
And I'm tryin' to make a point, as if the score matters
Slam. The door shatters. I'm hanging like some bored batters
Flying out at night just to watch the whores scatter

Sure. I tend to get stuck up in the rafters
Drifting with my thoughts, caught up in disasters;
Whirlpools of slander, hurricane slam dancers
Blur my brain faster, disturbing the gray matters

I play the same caper I've played since day one:
A plaster-cast bastard trying to stay out of the sun
Cool as alabaster, a pale-faced imitation
Stacking up my chips, getting cracks in my foundation

Until I found salvation in an hour-glass maiden
Took a sip and couldn't quit--I love the way she tasted
Couldn't flip the wasting, witness disintegration;
Cryptic communications got me twisted up and faded

So we build it up just to break it down
Thinking about thinking, getting over and around
We build it up just to break it down
As soon as we get up, we're thinking about getting down

When she laughs, she shakes the ground, so
Catch me sitting silent, trying to embrace the sound
I'm waking now, breaking down every detail I've found
Deciphering hieroglyphics--a pyro and a mystic

Missile silos stand, mimic the war of Roses and Cynics
But all's fair, I guess. Stack up the matches and gimmicks
We package each shipment to distract all the minions, and
It looks great from a distance, but there's cracks in the finish

I've mastered the method of packing up imperfections
Sweep dust under the carpet, a closet full of resurrections
Heart beneath the floorboards, brain in the freezer section
So I can ignore all the problems for my own greedy protection

The resulting situation's made of cheap imitations
Never gettin deep enough to complete the equation
All the numbers I get merely add to the frustration
'Cause I know if I call you up, I risk over-stimulation

This game of cat and mouse got me savage with doubt
I've got so much to say that I may never let get out
And part of me thinks I should just break down and speak
But Time is usually a better cure for this type of disease

Its never enough to ease the breakdown
Please never give up--my dreams are fake now
These treasures will rust. We need to break out
Sleep. Tremors. Combust. Bleed the pain out

So where you at?
Where's the bears and big cats?
What's the haps?
What damage is smashing your side of the map?
Lost in the woods
Bread crumbs swallowed by bats
Listen to your heart beat
How about you follow that

So where you at?
Where's the bears and big cats?
What's the haps?
What damage is smashing your side of the map?
Lost in the woods
Bread crumbs swallowed by bats

We build it up just to break it down
We build it up just to break it down

We sit in the grass and we talk of our pasts
A rollcall of all our lovers
A feeling arises we both recognize
We could fulfill each other
What if we do?

We each have travelled and come to a rest
We're trying to make things happen
Neither of us know how to measure success
Hey, we could fall in love and be happy
What if we do?

All the butterflies rise to the surface
I say stupid things when I get nervous
Watch the sunset, forget all the chatter
All the butterflies say it don't matter

It's getting late. We had better head back
We could stop and get some dinner
There's a full moon rising, the stars are aligned
We could spend the night together
What if we do?

I'm so shy
I left the morning after a key disaster
At the evening affair
Within the first five minutes alone
At the evening affair
Within the first five minutes alone
I was so tongue-tied
I gave the wrong impression of the wrong suggestion
Graduation day
Graduation day
You'd think by now I'd learn to stay away
You're the friend of a friend
That's the last I ever heard
Why do I try?
I stated my defenses from 1 to 99
I'd like to sing you a song about the last five seconds of love
I'd like to sing you a song about the last five seconds of love
With the sun in my eyes
I made a full confession
I learned my lesson well
Graduation day

Oh you'd think by now I'd learn
Don't you think by now I'd learn to stay away?

Everybody learns to get what they want
Why should I be different?

Lies come back to laugh at your insides
Why should I be different?

I know what you'll say
I know what you'll say
I know just what you'll say
Before you speak a word

Straight lines
Single file
One way right
Everyday
So why do I stay when the word is so big?
And I know what you'll say
I know just what you'll say
Before you speak the words

Whisper to me
Whisper to me

Talking to me
Sing sing sing sing

And there goes all our lovely weather

You could become a statistic
And there'd be no one left to miss you

You better get it while you can

They're putting water in the whisky just to keep the boys in line
You ain't busting up my place like you did last time
The drinks are getting weaker with every round they serve
The way they keep us sober is getting on my nerves
So when I'm dead and gone, I want some sugar in my coffin
If I goatta go, I want some sugar in my coffin
Oh no there ain't no Elvis Presley from the waist down
Or else I ain't learned nothin' from T.V
He's shaking like an animal, point that camera where I said
We need this white boy going crazy like a hole in the head
So when I'm dead and gone, I want some sugar in my coffin
If I goatta go, I want some sugar in my coffin
I want sugar in my coffin, I wanna cut the bitter taste
But they hide it in your money and there's cameras everyplace
I been living with it just about as long as I can face
So if I goatta go...
I want some sugar in my coffin
I want some sugar in my coffin
Well I heard about the seance in the Whitehouse yesterday
Has President Lincoln lost his mind?
They caught him in the graveyard diggin' in the mud
That's the father of our nation with a sickness in his blood
So won't you listen to me mister, I want some sugar in my coffin
If I really goatta go, I want some sugar in my coffin
I want sugar in my coffin, I wanna cut the bitter taste
But the President's a liar the country's fallen in disgrace
If they're ever coming clean they ainn't got no time to waste
So if I goatta go...
I want some sugar in my coffin
I want some sugar in my coffin
I want some sugar mister...I want some sugar mister...
I want some sugar in my coffin

October 12th is hotter than Hell in Texas

And Clara James had no idea what hit her
Well we coulda done something if we had our shotguns here
But corsicana Texas is town without no shade
And we never shoulda let that freak-show pass through here
You got tosend a telegram off to P.T. Barnum
Cause somebodys gonna take the blame and it might be you
Send a telegram off to P.T. Barnum
Cause the old man always knows what to do
I swear to God I never seen nothin like it
That fender folded up like a valentine
And the trainers broke their necks but they couldnt do nothin
That Elephants gonna be himself just one time
And the day will fall upon you and the autumn will start to burn
You can wash your hands but this stain is worse than wine
You got tosend a telegram off to P.T. Barnum
Cause somebodys gonna take the blame and it might be you
Send a telegram off to P.T. Barnum
Cause the old man always knows what to do
Well they marched Black Diamond throught the streets of Corsicana
But they could not chain that ghost up to the trees
He shook his head and he stumbled after the first shots
It was forty-nine before the Elephant fell to his knees
But theres a funeral born in the Circus like a stone baked in the bread
Even the bullets wilted in shame like a nest of bees
You got tosend a telegram off to P.T. Barnum
Cause somebodys gonna take the blame and it might be you
Send a telegram off to P.T. Barnum

Eyes of wet diesel for him to see
He sat there on is daily routine
I drank tea in my local canteen
Strolled along down the narrowing road
There was bus stops and large purple toads
White pianos advanced from the hill
While a llama chased a guy called Bill
I saw a giraffe as high as my knee
He was making shapes of letter Z
It rained blue sponges for half an hour
While the boys they played chess in the tower
Aha aha aha jay ri re re rumble
Aha aha scri ve he likes apple crumble
Bill bought a pony
It cost lots of money

May pull apart his frame

I can only love those dark hills because I live in the day
I can only see the mountain because I am in town
I only love night because I have only smelled it
Actually living in the night means no talking
I can only say ""no flashlight"" because once I forgot it
Actually living in the night means
Actually walking in the dark means to find caves in song

"
8932,"

In the night
After the bats come out
I hear your howling

I know no one and
I hold nothing (now that I know you)
This is how we howl

In the dark night on the unlit trail there's no way
Through but to crawl
Perplexed by the world around me there's no way
Through but to surrender my body completely
To you
To be eaten, to be gnawed
To fulfill the pregnant night
And then to be born in the mornings

(to be quiet)

"
8933,"

So I set out on the sea
With a little food for me
And a sharp harpoon for the whale that I'm hunting
The fine women on the shore
They called out ""give us more!""
But I have nothing to give (as if I did before)
Before my house burned down last night
And I killed my friends in a fight
So like I said, I paddled out in morning light
To see if I could see
A shape come from the deep
Or if I could hear it's song of love at night taunt me
And though I know I'm getting some
My fingers are getting numb
I sit and toss and the cold waves wash over me
And I've been out here for sixty days
There's no sign of spout or spray
And the cold dark night falls down the flat black sea
And in the calm I close my eyes
I lean back, rock from side to side
I am placid, I have slowly gone starry skies
With half closed eyes
But with a 'thump' 'thump' beneath my boat
Watch the water rise
And storms rage in my skiff crumbles
And the whale beneath assails and humbles
It says: ""Knock knock!"" from beneath
""You know it's me!
I'm your heart, I'm a whale
I'm the bottom of the deep black sea
My mouth is white and toothy""

"
8934,"

""Where is Mount Eerie and how do I get there?
And how long's the walk and what should I bring?""
Mount Eerie is nowhere
Mount Eerie is playing tonight

""Where is the concert and will it be all ages?
And what time are doors?
And how much does it cost?""
The concert is nowhere
There is only one sky

""I accept the invitation
I would like to 'fulfil the pregnant night'
Where should I set my stuff up?""
Those things are not yours
And tonight you will be taken in dark arms

"
8935,"

The air in the morning
(and the way that Halloween is always approaching)
Will enter the room
It will find my cheek and will wake me up roaring
With the rains come Halloween
And with the night comes the air in the morning
My costume will be myself with the night on my face
So I stand in the rain in the dark with the world unfolding
The air in the morning comes in song

"
8936,"

As the black bird above you [the bat]
Disappears into the night, [and the song of the bat]
The cave beyond the foothills, [the bat]
In the night, is overflowing [and in the bat's mouth]
In song

"
8937,"

Your love
Swells and pounds me

I know nothing now that I know you
My face goes blank
My eyes go open gates
And the world can go (in them)
And the world can stay and make us wealthy
And take away
So, I hold nothing

Now that I hold nothing (now that I hold you)
There's no place to use our money where we live
The generous world suggests generous living
So we lay under low wide branches
Of the oldest tree on the dune, in the hay
Where we will stay for so long
That the careful birds will relax
And make black nests in your black hair
And walk around beneath my still feet
And we will only notice the play of the world for a moment
And let it roll on, the way the world rolls on
We will only notice the world for a moment
And let it roll on, the way the world rolls on
The world, for a moment, and let it roll on
The way the world rolls on
Through open gates
And we will only notice the play of the world
(that long moss is growing on us)
(that the wind has rewritten us)
(the give and take not stopping ever)
For only a moment

In a generous way:
I give long walks to the dogs (In a generous way, I)
I put commas and periods in songs
I give closed eyes to the day
I give peace to the long decay
(we do not need to fear dying)

I can only love those dark hills because I live in the day

Knowing no one understands these songs
I try to sing them clearer
Even though no one has ever asked:
""What does Mount Eerie mean?""

I have tried to repeatedly explain
In complicated songs
But tonight we will find out
I know no one
And no one knows me

I lost my train
My train of thought
And it won't come back

It's in the way

I was lazy on my lazy way
Didn't have much to say
Along came a girl like a spider
Looking pretty – to be admired

As if it would really matter
All the world on a silver platter
So many think that way these days
But I always hope things would turn out okay

Forever
Love enchanted
Forever
Love will do it to ya
Haunt you like a ghost
It really is the most
It'll have you charmed

Couldn't have known the danger there
And everyone was just a stranger
Though the Good Book would guide me through
I always thought a lot of you

I was lost in the discount bin
Listening to the tired philosophers
Who never quite made it some how
Talked to, lied to
But still true, still true

Forever
Love enchanted
Forever
Love will wash your brain
Haunt you like a ghost
It really is the most
It'll make you craze

Though I know I won't resign
It was just like Christmas time
As the crowd would cheer me on
I knew the face of death – smiling back

Would you follow me anywhere
Are you entertained by deep despair
Have you on the edge of your chair?
Wondering what loves sorrow got you there?

Forever
Love enchanted
Forever
Love is out to get ya
Haunt you like a ghost
It really is the most
It'll have you stung

"
8973,"

I had a dream about you

You were the queen of quite a few

And I was there, but you didn't care

I didn't matter somehow

The band played and you sang a tune

And the stars fell down from the moon

And you smiled a smile that parted the sea

But you didn't notice me

No

Your eyes filled up the sky and they were blue

And you had a weird monkey there with you too

And you danced a jig and tipped his hat

And you turned around with a grin so fat

And he was me

There were lights and fireworks and cannons going off in your honor

And I was worried

But a man said ""Don't worry, nothing can harm her""

And I grabbed the microphone and I stood all alone

And I looked up at you, and you looked down at me

And then you said ""Off with his head""

I had a dream about you

"
8974,"

True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who was your friend
Don't be sad I know you will
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end
This is a promise with a catch
Only if you're looking can it find you
Cuz true love is searching too
But how can it recognize you
Unless you step out into the light, the light
Dont' be sad I know you will
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end
---

"
8975,"

Wish I see everywhere
The love that's there is nowhere
Then I do declare
No matter what, and forever

Where there is always no kind of love
And never was no, never
Then you might think you see a glory there
It's shining there, so frightening

Forever your love it turns
Your love it turns away
Your brother and your sister there
Have long since gone away

And I see the setting sun
Like an atom bomb forever
And all the dead people there
Who thought they were so clever

Forever it seems to have taken
What they feared had entertained them
And now they'll see themselves in the past
As it came before them

Forever your love it turns
Your love it turns away
Your brother and your sister there
Have long since gone away

And now, one last time
Do you believe in the faithless?
Do you think that maybe
Your heart could stop the hatred?

Do you think that love can save you now
When it past the hour of repentance?
Oh the tears that you shall cry
Is over now, class dismissed

Forever your love it turns
Your love it turns away
Your brother and your sister there
Have long since gone away

You soft soap
The soft-shelled
The porous
Morons like me
And you're not sorry

Piece of cake
To shake off
Principles
Hard-won scruples
And pretty virtue

Crushed into the bottom
Of mud-yellow sand
Like a slippershell

Chrome
Like phosphorescent teeth
In mud-yellow skin
You're a slippershell
And you can go to hell

Hard water
Down your throat
Down your back
Hard to say it's hard luck
When you're so happy
Hard to say it's hard luck
When we had it coming

Crushed into the bottom
Of mud-yellow sand
Like a slippershell

Chrome
Like phosphorescent teeth
In mud-yellow skin
You're a slippershell
And you can go to hell
Maybe see me there

Can't you see it's a white-out
Made of chrome?
Can't you see the white-out?
It's why i piss and moan
It's why i can't go home

Wallet full of fat
Belly full of milk
You're touchingly, deeply fulfilled
You're very old
You're very new
You're touchingly, deeply confused

Can't you see the white-out?
No, i guess you don't

"
9551,"

My lip gloss froze off
Outside the airport
On a hard bench
Beside a dingy Santa
I searched every face

What are you?
Animated soft tissue
Shifting neuropeptides
A social pyromaniac
A plate spinner

And it's smoky around you
I can hardly breathe

I watched your eyes go dark
I saw them look blank
I wasn't there
I saw it in pictures
After the fact

And it's smoky around you
I can hardly breathe

"
9552,"

Around dusk
You walk the seven blocks to paradise
And throw your arms around it
Part of the cattle call to harmony

At dawn it breaks
But much too late to wreck the night
We spun a silken effort
Wrapping the day in softer company

My favorite distant sadist
The acid test tangle
Face to face

Under the lights
Whatever it takes to kill me off
And throw your arms around me
Wrapping the night in ugly harmony

My favorite distant sadist
The acid test tangle
Face to face

"
9553,"

I couldn't sleep anyway
The hole you left is full of rain

Morning birds screamed all night
If there was just a little light left
Something to grow into panic

Homeless
Coming home
I could not stop moving
Now i can't move
I miss you
I bet i take this lying down

You know it'd be a justified sin
You know it'd be a justified sin
You know it'd be clean

You know it'd be purifying
You know it'd be purifying
You know it'd be clean

Morning birds screamed all night
If there was just a little fright left
Something to grow into panic

Homeless
Coming home
I could not stop moving
Now i can't move
I miss you

"
9554,"

In the boiling grip of bad love
I was dizzy with hunger and oxygen
And it was so goddamn cold

And then i can't see my shoe to tie it
Eyes full of tears and i'm not a crier
And you were so goddamn cold

And ever since
There's only heartbreaking you
Maybe you shoulda let me drown

All i wanted was to swim out to sea
I only wanted us to swim out to sea
Maybe you shoulda let me drink
Maybe you shoulda let me speed

In a well-lit mexican restaurant
I order badly, so we make out
Tequila in our hands
We'll never breathe again

"
9555,"

In a suburban desert
A fast food high
We swipe at peeling paint
Swat away flies

The crawling milk-fed
Squawking cream-filled
Hominids
Ids

Immune to broken
To wasted time
To bolts of lightning

Bungee together
Your body's guards
The bloodiest bond
Blacking out the dark

The darkest flame
The darkest waltz
A sunburnt snarl
Thrashing and parched

A singular desire
To drive into the dirt
No lust, no gluttony
We're free as algae

In a suburban desert
A fast food high
We swipe at peeling paint
Swat away flies

The crawling milk-fed
Squawking cream-filled
Hominids
Ids

Immune to broken
To naked shame
To bolts of lightning

To broken flame
To broken waltz
To sunburnt snarls
Thrashing and parched

A singular desire
To drive into the dirt
No lust, no gluttony
We're free as algae

Those with an all-consuming passion in lockstep

"
9556,"

Your mouth fell out of the sky
And suddenly i had it memorized
But honestly, it's like you're dead

I can't shake off voodoo
Or your thudding making noise
The pearls you cast before swine
Make you seem alive

A pretty picture of you breathing air
And you're just standing there
Static

Show me how you do it
A thousand miles away from here
You're one micron away from me

Your hope is on the wing is on a bus tearing down the road
You're cold you're made of heat you're made of skin, made of cloth and bone

Your hope is on the wing is on a bus tearing down the road
(your road is in the dark is in the sun, in the rain and cold)
You're cold you're made of heat you're made of skin, made of cloth and bone
(your bones are made of sponge are made of plexiglass, tin and hope)

"
9557,"

In a deep cold
You can't be brave
In a deep cold
You can't be safe

When the wind blows
You won't be strong
When the wind blows
You won't be strong

Blows with a spine-chilling
Moan

Let's drink to each other
And drink each other half to death

I'm jumping out of my skin
I'm jumping out of my skin again

"
9558,"

The ground's on fire
The ground's on fire
And so are you
God left you here, too

You could call for rain
You could call for rain
Your new moguls: trees
Some full, some lonely
Both help you think

I'm sorry

And you were right
It was okay to be scared

"
9559,"

You paint your own tv on the wall
Carve out insects to feed us all
Lights flash by and the fast world echoes your thoughts

Your compass led you to the edge of a lake
You'll singe your nuts down there if you take
Such bad advice from the love gods of hate
You'll get cold

You get burned, you get cold

On the plush green rug in the lime green light
Eyes like white stones in black light
I promise you everything that you like

I go ""mississippi kite""

Gloss assails us then dims
Comic book nights, la grim
The hollywood martians, lucky stiffs, fucking wing

You told me enough times you can't give me enough rope
To hang myself one time, but I can always hope
You come down on me so hard that I choke and go

You get burned, you get cold

Meanwhile, I feed you boric acid and air
Lemon drops, snow cream, speckled eggs
The sweat seeps in through a crack in your head

You go ""mississippi kite""

"
9560,"

I left you cracking up in the east river
Like some river devil
Both cruel and unusual
Thick with gold and smoking

My friend
Under the wire again

And by the way
You cost a fortune
And by the way
You cast a shadow today

I watched you crawling up through the leaf litter
You don't seem to need to breathe
Unlike us oily, flimsy, cheap
Thick with wonder bread

My friend
Under the weather again

And by the way
You cost a fortune
And by the way
You cast a shadow today

"
9561,"

The freeway's freeway close
I laugh from the back
The race is over

Headlights on your teeth
Race down both your backs
In the dark blue car
A party

Blue trash on the floor
I hope you find your hunger
In a hungry world

Oh what a shame
I let you invade my brain again
What did you see inside
A simple place to hide
Away from you
Now you're trapped here
Looks like the jokes on you
I've got the only key out
I'm not giving it to you
Where are your friends now
I'm the only one who can help you

The saddest part of this
Is the way that we kiss
It makes me feel right
Yeah,it makes me feel right
I look inside your eyes
To see where you hide
But you never let me in
No, you'll never let me in
Now I see that the joke is certainly on me
I'm stuck outside the only place that I wanna be
Oh what a sad reality

1
Equate physical with first light and last breath
Obtained impossible from incept of this quest
Cave your puffed chest if you act like you best
Flow monosyllabic 'til you prove intellect
Ingest filthy water to survive this trek
Weary of these kids with clear eyes who inspect
First draft of manuscripts never reach depths
The kid who tagged along that you thought of as pest
Grew to 5'6"" with thick skin
Hispanic
Dome contains wisdom within words we manic
My anger seems standard
I've grimaced since youth
A smile's of no use when it's death we speak to

2
Subdued speech pattern now seems familiar
Fear derived from ignorance makes sense in circumstance
Advanced gesture tell tale
Draw line in sand
Mistake to reawake ones who claim to understand
Remain rugged eyes open
Clench first fist over hand
Mental stay potent 'till gasps of broken man
Eyes keep focusing
Styles you noticing
Diseased because I am

What you fear nigga? I peeped you ball that fist
You can't walk these streets cause you ain't equipped

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1: MC Dälek]

I felt that isolated stare from a million pairs of eyes
Burnt this feeling into retina used as rhythmic device
Devise an I'll supply unrefined imagery
Can express captured hatred quite vividly
Won't resort to use of single simile
Actions simply savage to a god's symmetry
You lack civility
Descend from men of caves
While we gave the gift of cities
My people's architects
Your actions parasitic
When it comes to artforms get it straight son we live it
If this was '85 I'd be telling you y'all bit it
I'll play eternal cynic
The tongues I speak intrinsic
Linguistics lodged in larynx made the words you spit transparent
Tales known to Two divided lives collide at Varick
Reformed in form of lyrics
A page of hieroglyphics
Marks mathematics of a people's true existence
When force exceeds resistance
It's our core that loses vision

[Verse 2: MC Dälek]

Restored glory just to be reduced to rubble
Dismantled culture's last gasp is never subtle
Common psyche troubled
Infants drown in puddles
Shallow answers sabotage attempts at weak rebuttal
You'd miss my essence even if you wrote this verse verbatim
Deranged sense of rhythm gives this griot endless patience
Obtained ancient manuscript said to hold salvation
It read ""your quest for fairy tales will lead to more frustration.""
Formulated thoughts now condensed to pure equation
Arithmetic of breath coincides with vicious nature

I script gutter beats and scribes lyrics
Sounds to resonate for days off these ears that simply fear it
Situate my verse six inches off curb
Eternally perturbed
When will these kids learn?
I watch with concern of elder statesman
Only breathed for three decades
But displayed i ain't vacant
Ranks of MC's infested with fakeness
It's time to act like men and reawake this
With blatant aim at cranium
I dispel your bitch rumors
Tuned to blocks with hangers
Wires giving tumors
Never write my songs for consumers
Ironic cause i write for heads with fat laces on their Pumas
Poisonous pen drips ink with each thought
The antidote you sought's been lost
Your hand's forced
Your truth? False
Corrupt world crumbles under feet
Detect deceit on these streets

Chorus:
World's corrupt but you still want more?
(We want more!)
That's what's up cause we all stay poor
(We stay poor!)
Time's up but you still what more?
(We want more!)
Knuckle up cause we ready for war!

World's corrupt but you still want more?

Caught me mid thought at quarter paragraph
Parallel lives aligned at gallows
Gallantly attack while our armies amassed
Disastrous results to be read past tomorrow
Never one to follow i lead with staggered step
Bring the vilest subject to forefront
Forecast is grim for our type gentlemen
My mom's taught me right in her fog of saint's statues
Spit a verse i'll match you
Never need to battle
Ask my nigga Dev we left lungs at waterfront
Give a fuck where you're from
It's how that mind rattles
Intelligence fatal in this nation of cattle
The notion of freedom straight babble
Child of Babylon that traveled foreign soil
Within core of heart lies eternal turmoil

Chorus:
World's corrupt but you still want more?
(We want more!)
That's what's up cause we all stay poor
(We stay poor!)
Time's up but you still what more?
(We want more!)
Knuckle up cause we ready for war!

World's corrupt but you still want more?

Forgive the bluntness of these statements
Bloodstains are hard to erase like krylon
Komplx sentence spoken again in dälek
To give it the weight it deserves and expects
Peace to my nigga Rek
At noon we resurrect to resume this vicious cycle
Precious wine seems so vital when eyes been bloodshot
Recite slurred truths and whatnot to few heads that still nod
Fuck these fake sucka frauds
Formulating freestyles that ring false
Sick of these Yeses and Yalls
I need that boom bap with bass like Lou Rawls
To make walls of Jericho fall
Son you'll never find iller verses than mine
Gave inner sight to the blind through speech
Without having skin of god's bleached

Adapt to daylight that breaks over roofs on horizon
Split chest to concrete to clear sinus
Letters curve like true writers
Respect due to Phase2
Bombs grew from angst of knuckled fighters

The ones who fell in urban combat
The ones who never cared to adapt
The ones in life who always felt trapped
The ones who made a real impact
The ones who molded exactly where these thought sat

Verses amplified acoustically through wires
Makes perfect sense in mind with liquored virus
It all makes sense when mind's on liquored virus
Traveled under soil with Osiris
Birth and death of modern world on the Tigris
Why fight this?
Okt nigga why you even mic this?
Most the rest of world don't even like us
Ink flow from pen to raw papyrus
12 straight hours doing work ain't even tired
Tried and hung from sycamore
Cause i attempt to play Picasso for the poor
No one wants to hear this lion's roar
No one wants to hear a lion's roar
Attempts on life are insured
With truths i spit on tours
Bourge muthafukas expect us on all fours
Use brute force when i need to underscore
The perfect paragraph always hit block raw
Hits blocks (raw)

Endure the everyday, remain tarnished
Truth is all tarnished
Corner stoops is all tarnished
Even when it's strength we try to harness
My mental stay tarnished
The way we act on streets is all tarnished
Even when we meek we still tarnished
All the words we speak is mad tarnished
The core of man tarnished

They say at best we tamed savage
This train of thought kept collective souls all ravished
Raised a weary fist to catch my breath above the gutter
Gave away our hope and dignity as not to smother
We still suffer!
Tragedy at times results in stutter
Stability off kilter
Resist within oppression
The struggle is our weapon
Perhaps this is the blessing
Existence as the lesson

Ink flow from pen to raw papyrus
12 straight hours doing work ain't even tired
Tried and hung from sycamore
Cause i attempt to play Picasso for the poor
No one wants to hear this lion's roar
No one wants to hear a lion's roar
Attempts on life are insured
With truths i spit on tours
Bourge muthafukas expect us on all fours

No need to mention where we is or where we at
Instead i reminisce on all my peoples that we lost Black
The ones who molded exactly where these thought sat
The ones who taught me how to act
The ones who fell in urban combat
The ones who never cared to adapt
The ones in life who always felt trapped
The ones who made a real impact
The ones who had the qualities your average man lacks
Commit their memories to wax
In fact commit their very tarnished essence to the core of (this track)

Endure the everyday, remain tarnished
Truth is all tarnished
Corner stoops is all tarnished
Even when it's strength we try to harness
My mental stay tarnished
The way we act on streets is all tarnished
Even when we meek we still tarnished
All the words we speak is mad tarnished
The core of man tarnished

Endure the everyday, remain tarnished
Truth is all tarnished
Corner stoops is all tarnished
Even when it's strength we try to harness
My mental stay tarnished
The way we act on streets is all tarnished
Even when we meek we still tarnished
All the words we speak is mad tarnished
The core of man tarnished

Give me a damn break
I don't wanna spend my money on you, boy
It's ninety cents a minute
And i don't believe you're in it
For the real thing
You want the feeling
That you're someone to me but i just can't believe that you'll never be
I said get on your knees, boy
I said beg for me please, boy
I didn't say call me on the phone
I didn't say remind me i'm alone
I didn't wanna call you back
But i'd be lying if i said that was the truth
And that's a fact, jack
I wanted to make a life with you
As a matter of fact, that's all i wanted to do
I was gonna give up everything just to wake up in the morning with my baby by my side

[Verse]
I wonder is it vain enough to be thinking about traitors and hero means truth
Has this battle been fought or won over many times?
If we're still alive and make it that means something old hearts and hands join in
Surround this pyre
Burning chance and wishes fade and rotten dreams escaping over the wreckage
wounded boy let gardens
swamps of poison
I don't miss this kiss of treachery

[Chorus]
God damn you
Graceless lady
Get off of my shoes
God damn you

[Verse]
How lost in detaches it mid-stride
of purpose is the action
the carrier moves on
unknowingly and coldly
Until he reaches his own destination
Taken for granted alone they both weep forgotten
Waterfalls I wept against time and nature
Loving humanity
Is this the only thing that prevails?

[Chorus]
God damn you
Graceless lady
Get off of my shoes
God damn you

[Verse]
Piles of spoiled treats around you
Water seeping through foundations xxx
Would turn us all in-inside out
Kissing the lovers with
turned into mesh
turn into I pressure time
for the future isn't what it used to be
Diana among our possessions
Choking on each other

[Chorus]
God damn you
Graceless lady
Stepping on my shoes
God damn you
Graceless lady

God damn you
Graceless lady
Get off of my shoes
God damn you

The ghetto
Parking garage
Stiletto, stiletto barrage
Stay here
Love seats
'Till nature's chasing
Impossible dreams

I know what you want
I know what you need
But I can't give it to you
And I can't make my heart true
No, I can't give it to you
But I know if I did
Things could change

You're beautiful
Why would you wanna die?
You're beautiful
Why would you wanna die?
You're beautiful
Why would you wanna die?

Hasidic Jews
Are praying in the corner
Of the ghetto
Parking garage
As New York City's rock girls
File out of the rock show
In a stiletto barrage

I know what they want
I know what they really need
But I can't give it to them
And I can't make my heart friends
No, I can't give it to them
But I know if I do
Things could change

Did you mean what you said when you told me you missed us
Without reservation, without plans for Christmas
First part was right, the rest wasn't true
The same goes for me and the same goes for you
Packed my things for the month but it's not necessary
I told you I'd stay but it's just temporary
Like swastika girls who fell back on their looks
We relied on the tricks and the recycled hooks
Did you want a response or just someone to edit?
It's not what you said, it's the way that you said it
The longshoreman's daughter, when they spelled her name
Found three chords of brilliance and rode them to fame, all alone
Pep up the formula tonight
You're not obliged to do us favors
Disenchanted hearts unite
When you and I were candy ravers
Krushchev's Ekranoplan had failed
Those weeks in August never seem fair
Our love is left to sink or sail
You cut the summer blonde from your hair
A little time is all I need
A disco bloodbath for the ages
The patience left to let it bleed
And a quill to fill the pages
Side streets set ablaze
And all roads lead to maybe
Sometimes I think about those days
Sometimes I wish we'd kept the baby
I don't know how things could have changed
At the latest
Our days in Kansas wouldn't last
I never learned the KU fight song
Exchanging poisons from the past
I hadn't heard from you in so long
And if the moonlight kills the flame
With all the moments we were meant to
You know I'll tell the world your name
I couldn't let the world forget you
Things were so much easier back in 1993
I loved you for the first time on that day

Well there's a feeling in this world
That causes unrest
Your ambition and success
Is what i detest
I try to be true
I'm trying my best
I'm not seduced by your cheap love
Hatreds and mess

You make me die

I heard all you gotta say
I heard it in school
About your soft-soap sex
And your sickly drawl
But you only care for yourself
Just like all the rest
You love you filthy god
And think you're the best

You make me die

TVs, videos, money and vice
Get you crawling on the floor
Like a suckin lice
You'll swallow seed
Before you take advice
Well someone should of told you girl
That ain't very nice

You make me die

I remember all the things
All the things I did as a child
X2
When I see what they're doing
It's enough to drive me wild

I remember all the things
All the things we did in the past

But you done left me child's
And don't think I'm gonna last

Solo

Well remember the dress you wore
All the things that drove me wild
I remember all the things
From when you was a child

[Verse 1]
Kind of hard
Hard to see
When you crawl
On your hands and your knees
With your face
In the trough
Wait your turn
While they finish you off
Don't know when it started
Don't know how
Should have found out
Should have happened by now
Got these lines
On my face
After all this time
And I still haven't found my place

[Chorus]
I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all

[Verse 2]
I wake up
On the floor
Start it up again
Like it matters anymore
I don't know
If it does
Is this really all
That there ever was?
Put the gun
In my mouth
Close your eyes
Blow my fucking brains out
Pretty patterns
On the floor
That's enough for you
But I still need more, more, more

[Chorus]
I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all
I jump from every rooftop (I this really all)
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all

[Outro]
I don't
Feel
Anything
I don't
Feel
Anything
I don't
Feel

I don't
Feel

I don't

[Verse 1]
The sky is painted black
The smoke pours out the stack
One hand upon your heart
One hand behind your back
You train us how to act
You keep the fear intact
The imminent attack
Everything is right on track

[Chorus]
And we are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
And we are letting you get away
(away with it)
We are letting you get away
(away with it)
We are letting you get away
(away with it)
We are letting you get away
(away with it)

[Verse 2]
Upon our plates to feed
The dying left to bleed
How much we really need
Your politics of greed
The cancer takes ahold
The wolf is in the fold
Our destiny's been sold
We do just what we're told

[Chorus]
And we are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
And we are letting you get away
(away with it)
We are letting you get away
(away with it)
We are letting you get away
(away with it)
We are letting you get away
(away with it)

[Verse 3]
Your armies filled with hate
Believing your charade
Begin to suffocate
For us it's far too late

[Chorus]
And we are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
We are letting you get away
And we are letting you get away

We are letting you get away

We are letting you get away

[Verse 1]
Am I
Am I still tough enough?
Feels like I’m wearing down, down, down, down, down
Is my viciousness
Losing ground, ground, ground, ground ground?
Am I taking too much
Did I cross a line, line, line?
I need my role in this
Very clearly defined

[Chorus]
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself

[Verse 2]
And now it's starting up
Feels like I'm losing touch
Nothing matters to me
Nothing matters as much
I see you left a mark
Up and down my skin
I don't know where I end
And where you begin

[Chorus]
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself

[Bridge]
I can not stop myself
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself

I need your discipline
(And you)
I need your help
(Once I start I cannot stop myself)
I need your discipline
(And you know)
Because once I start I cannot stop myself
I need your discipline
(And you)
I need your help

I need your discipline
(And you know)
Because once I start I cannot stop myself
(And you)
Once I start I cannot stop myself

Cannot stop myself

[Verse 1]
Nice and high and far apart
Just like they said
I built this place with broken parts
Just like they said
You chip away the old version of you
You'd be surprised at what you can do
I'm safe in here
Irrelevant
Just like they said

[Chorus 1]
My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls

[Verse 2]
You feel me breathe, I am watching you
I see it all
The many ways you can't get to me
I see it all
I see the hell you put yourself through
Oh the things I could do (if I wanted to)

[Chorus 2]
My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls

[Interlude]
I don't need anything at all
My voice just echoes off these walls

[Outro]
And I just slowly fade away

You
What you looking at?
Head down
Too late for that
What you want
What you get
Know your place
Don't ever forget

[Chorus]
And this is not my face
And this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here
I can recognize
And this is all a dream
And none of you are real
I'll give anything
I'll give anything

[Verse 2]
Hey you
What you running from?
All your hate
What you've become
Bet you didn't think
It would happen to you
All used up
Half way through

[Chorus]
And this is not my face
And this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here
I can recognize
And this is all a dream
And none of you are real
And I'll give anything
You know, I'll give anything

[Verse 1]
She's mostly gone
Some other place
I'm getting by
In other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear
Is coming true
Try to justify the things
I used to do
Believe in you

[Chorus 1]
Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you

[Verse 2]
I tried to stay away
Just in case
I've come to realize
We all have our place
Time, time has a way you know
To make it clear
And I have my role in this
I can't disappear
Or leave you here

[Chorus 2]
Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
And I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Are waving goodbye
And I am staying right beside you

Set your channel for imminent collapse
No reforms can save us from ourselves
A travesty generations old
A tragedy written in stone
Engraved on our tombstones that mark our scars on the earth

Etched in towers threatening to obey the curse
The churning continues
Accelerating so that short of complete and total extinction...

Days of destruction follow days of destruction
Reducing life to such horrid display
That a redefining of words is needed
To explain the wretchedness of the endless tunnel
With no light at the end

Only darkness following darkness swallowing darkness
Days of destruction follow days of destruction
No end in sight

So what’s left now

Turn your collar up son look outside it’s starting to rain
And by now it’s certain that bad times are ahead of this I’m certain
But of course you’re finding out

What a drag you know growing old
No one said it would be easy
And I know you don’t know
What you believe in anymore

Last night I felt there was something lacking

But I couldn’t quite figure out
I looked down at her face peacefully sleeping
But still had so much doubt

My baby she’s got me down
She says we’re growing old
Which leaves nothing to believe in

Feeling much better now then I did before
Now that we’ve been told the facts and everyone knows that
The world is flat took so long to find out
But it’s so much better now that things are simplified
A Paralyzer ParalyzerFeeling much better now than I did before ‘cause I got
No more reasons to get upset now that we’ve been trivialized
A Paralyzer Paralyzer
We’re secure in the fact that everyone knows the world is flat

Don’t get too close to the edge because it’s dangerous
And if you get too close it’s your own damn fault
For those who died well that’s tough

Don’t get too close to the edge

When I look back on our past transgressions
I am reminded of a few that made us feel so cool
But we were young and we were just pretending
How could I know you would be leaving us so soon
And oh I just don’t knowLike the one that brings me down
Is I won’t see you there at the show tomorrow
What comes over me is emptiness and sorrow

And oh I just don’t know how this could be

What a waste, what a waste
Living in misery since the year 2003
And they’re gone

When they walked into the reception hall hand in hand, the feeling of love and excitement in the room overwhelmed Lizzy. Waving as she passed the candle lit tables filled with her family and friends, she looked up at Adam whose cheeks were already flushed with excitement and surely Jack Daniels. When he squeezed her hand, she had to hold back the tears of joy threatening to escape, and she knew beneath the Ray Bans, Adam was fighting to do the same. As they walked toward the center of the room, memories of the last time they almost shared a dance floor filled Lizzy’s mind.

She remembered back to when the two were thirteen years old and awkward as can be, how her heart sank when she thought she was the only girl without an invitation to his bar mitzvah, and how the image of him leaning out of the school bus frantically waving an envelope in the air would be burned into her memory for decades. She must have skipped the whole way home.

Lizzy tried her best to recall the details of the bar mitzvah, but the years had blurred specifics. Besides Adam’s grand entrance on a go-kart and the souvenir t-shirt she now had tucked in her pajama drawer, the only memory left that was sharp in her mind was hearing Adam choose Tiffany Houzer for his first dance and not her. Her thirteen-year-old heart was crushed, and while it made for a good story, she still had yet to let him live that choice down.

It was strange for Lizzy to see her husband across the dance floor once again. She had imagined this moment over and over for close to fifteen years, dancing around her room to Etta James with a broom named Adam. To think that it was finally here made her giddy with excitement.

Countless homecoming dances and prom nights had passed, college formals and socials were long gone, and nights at the club were evolving into nights of Netflix and wine. But Adam still managed to spin Lizzy around the kitchen every once in a while as she packed their lunches or washed dinner dishes.

As the DJ announced the new Mr. and Mrs. to the mob of smiling faces, Lizzy couldn’t help but throw her hands into the air in jubilation. Laughing, Adam took her right hand in his and slid his arm around her waist. The violins began to swell and Etta James’ voice rang out with two words that Lizzy had been thinking all day long. After nearly twenty years of going to school together and more than a decade of dating, she could call Adam her husband at last.

Smiling big enough to reveal both rows of teeth, Lizzy got on her tiptoes and whispered into Adam’s ear, “Take that Tiffany.”

Ich hab 'n Zahnarzttermin, doch geh nicht hin
Komm nach Hause von der Nachtschicht und leg mich hin
Halb Schlaf, halb wach, der Zeiger steht auf halb Acht
Rollos runter, draußen scheint die Sonne doch sie prallt ab
Mein Nachbar ist Baser also lass ich ihn das Dope testen
Blow testen, Snow testen, das Kilo Coke testen
Wenn die Nase brennt waren es wohl die Salzkristalle
Streckmittel die wie Krebs dein Hals befallen
Nutten müssen Dick sucken und uns Kokaretten drehen
Rapper wollen so sein wie wir und imitieren das echte Leben
Du willst dein Geist erweitern - Limitless
Hol dir lieber sonnengebleichtes Zement bevor du Pillen frisst
Pustebacke, im Café sitzen, Shisha rauchen
Bis wir wieder losfahren und Bubbles dort im Kiez verkaufen

Steig ich in mein AMG, fahr im Viertel rum
Drive By, mache Geld mit Steine und
Hinterlasse im Puff ein Hazeduft, CK Projekt
Die Bubbles werden in Socken versteckt
Und im Hochhaus kochen sie Crack
Ah, kaputt ist die Welt
Im Kopfkissen bunker ich Geld
Ottkisten schmuggeln im Benz

NOW get busy

Sweet like a nut filled with Nutella
Creamy like buffalo mozzarella
Sneaking around you know I smell ya
Well I play ya like a peanut and throw the shell ya
Well I could give a fuzz if ya think you're a baller
I get so many huni 'round  you fall smaller
Middle school rapper and a proud yes y'aller
If ya think about your grandma go ahead call her
From the East Coast so I don't say hella
At the mic stand my performance is stellar
Pop the tape in and I listen to fella
I give a little shout to Nelson Mandela

NOW get busy

Known for the words that make you scream and holler
I'm Count Dooku to your Queen Amidala
Give a shout to Spiro or John Waller
I'm a student of the game and a bona fide scholar
So ease up on the bong to ease that coughin'
Butter's on the table now watch it soften
Bring in those beats and I'm a bring them often
I'm a keep rappin' when I'm in my coffin
Like a mind gone mad that is unwinding
In a padded room the walls you're climbing
Don't sign on the line if it looks binding
Ya have to get loose and find the lining

NOW get busy

[Verse 1]
Waking up feeling
Good and limber
When the telephone it ring

Was a bad man from
California
Telling of a stone he'd bring
I'd bring

[Hook]
And of
Better days
From this town
We'd escape
If we holler loud
And make our way
We'd all live
One big holiday

[Verse 2]
So we listened and
Up the river
And recorded all the sounds
Was some shaking and some
Record playing
All the leather kids were loud

Make me a sermon in my mouth
I've got to get away

Baby, I can close my eyes
I am no longer in Brooklyn
We are floating down the River Seine
We're on the beaches of Ibiza baby

Give me your kisses, baby
I can't afford to be afraid
I will jump for joy
Everyday

Make me a sermon baby
Make me a sermon baby
Make me a sermon in my mouth
I've got to get away

What's going on with this hysteria
No one seems to notice
Is it just me?
Or will everyone go blind?
I don't care if people are looking for something new
Even though they said I do
I learned my lesson, so will you

[Chorus 1]
We're all alienated

No one seems to notice
Is it just me?
Or has everyone gone blind?

So am I, so am I

Drunk and losing ground
Broken up and down
The only way I've found
To shake your body free

I've got what it takes
To help you make mistakes
To put you through a phase
That's harder than it seems

I'm not saying anything
You haven't heard before
No one's gonna wait for you
To wake up anymore
Changing all your scenery
Saying you don't care
But you're not going anywhere
Yeah

Spending all your days
Frozen in your place
Rearrange your face
To ways you better be

Having not enough
You'll never measure up
The alcohol and drugs
Are better off in me

"
12187,"

I've been sleeping with the lights on, buried in regrets
Breaking into sweats, naked as a falling leaf

It's a natural reaction, driven to distraction
Clawing at the ghosts I'll never meet

Oh, I don't know, where they go
When they vanish in the corner of my eye
And I, don't know why, I don't know
If they stay below or rise up to the sky

But I'm letting go
I'm letting go
It's a history that never really grows
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
It's a silent wind that never really blows
I'm letting go

I'm a slave without a master, heading for disaster
Kicking up the dust in the middle of the road

I've been waiting on a free ride ticket
To a seaside thicket on the edge of Puget Sound

And there I'll sit, and I'll admit
That I was only just a guest inside my skin
And by the dawn, I'll be gone
And I won't be holding on to anything again

(Chorus)

It's made up of steel, but it's not a motorcycle
It's made up of wheels, but it's not a motorcycle

Kings metal power true steel Oh yeah!
Nanowar'll always be there!

Tricycles of steel! Tricycles of steel!
Pollution is low, no fuel to go
We ride the tricycles of steel!
We ride the tricycles of steel!

Din din, the bell rings, our tricycles are for kings
(They run just like they had unicorn wings)
Din din, the bell plays, our tricycles are for gays

Okay so you're feeling all alone
I heard it on the radio
In a broadcast from the sky

Someday I'm gonna rock the boat
And I'm gonna wanna know
Why it's a great day to be outside

Keep me up with your emotions at night
Then you can shoot me down over the ocean and sigh

Certain death
Haven't had the heart to yet
Maybe by the time we meet
You can recognize a change in me
Baby, certain death
Haven't had the chance to yet
Maybe by the time we meet
You can recognize a change in me

I could count the times that it crossed my mind
Sick in bed and dying
From something I don't have
And will never have

And your best friends won't be your friends anymore
Won't pretend anymore to let you down or try

Keep me up with your emotions at night
Then you can
Shoot me down over the ocean and sigh

Keep me up with your emotions at night
Then you can
Shoot me down over the ocean and sigh

Certain death
Haven't had the heart to yet
Maybe by the time we meet
You can recognize a change in me
Baby, certain death
Haven't had the chance to yet
Maybe by the time we meet
You can recognize a change in me

Thursday morning waking
And lots of people crying
But I thought I saw angels there
Flying through the charnel air

They whispered don't you worry
For someone's petty hate and crimes
For good is here and everywhere
And God is always on our side

I saw my wife's eyes fill with tears
That her belief should bring us here
But don't you worry my fair dame
Yours and theirs just ain't the same

I told her these are not your sins
They're someone else's petty crimes
For good is here and everywhere
And god is always on your side

Hold me

The world I know's about to blow

Hold me

The world I know's about to go

Hold me

My life's as far as I can breath

Hold me

Don't know if I can bare to see

If good's still here and everywhere
And God is always on our side

Friends, we've put it off, you know it's time
We've got a lot of work to do, much bad we must undo
Now the time has come to tell the world
Spread the word to everyone, until all the bad's undone

Too many people are getting fat, struggle for their breath
Getting sickness from their water taps
Too many people born handicapped
Not to mention populations keep on rising off the map

Brother traded fathers' fields for smokestacks
Watch out memories turning black
Neighbors filled our father's creek with cow crap
And I feel it seeping through

Friends, let's realize the necessities
And differentiate between what you want and what you need
This economy's priorities, we've got to turn the upside down
So our health is number one

Too many people are getting fat, struggle for their breath
Getting sickness from their water taps
Too many people born handicapped
Not to mention populations keep on rising off the map

Brother traded fathers' fields for smokestacks
Watch out memories turning black
Neighbors filled our father's creek with cow crap
And I feel it seeping through

Too many product ads
Too many fashion fads
Too many TV sets
Too many garbage bags
Too many power plants
Too many bureaucrats
Too many promises
Not enough cleanup plans
Too many people don't know the facts
Too many people don't care to ask
Too many people trust governments
Too many people are ignorant
Too many people don't see the mess
Too many people follow the rest
Too many people don't ask themselves
Just where in the world was their garbage sent

Brother traded fathers' fields for smokestacks
Watch out memories turning black
Neighbors filled our father's creek with cow crap
And I feel it seeping through

WAKE UP
Every morning wake up early
HURRY
Drink some milk, make some coffee
CHARGE OFF
Catch the bus get to work
RUN, RUN, RUN

In your office, sit down quickly
READY
Let them drain you, stomp on pity
DON'T THINK
Feed your ambition, stuff your belly
MINDLESS
Reputation, perfect body
NO, NO SOUL

Stop your running
Find your time
Stop your running
You got to shine

Boss was crabby, late at home
HELPLESS
She is angry, dinner’s cold
ICE FROGS
Kids are shouting, on your own
DON’T CARE
Back to back, bed alone
IN WHITE NIGHTS

Stop your running

We've come to far to let this go
Always on the outside looking in

The door is swinging in the wind
It's time to go and march on in
It's time to show them what we're all about

I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now
I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now

I am gonna see again
And I am gonna feel again
We're not going to take this any more
We won't take this anymore

The shapes are hiding in the dark
The knives are out, the blades are sharp
It's one wrong move and all the lights are out

Watch your step and look ahead
Remember what the old man said
Failure is the aftermath of doubt

I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now
I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now

In the middle of a charming second
I'm in change with the tune of action
All I wanted was a little reaction

Don't be hanging around my friend I said I'm
All twisted up in wires
And even though you know it's best
You never get out, you never get out

So strange when you're out confessin'
In the trench with the trails impressin'
I never wanted to learn my lesson
All I wanted was a little attention

And maybe I don't really know you
But I guess you've lived without love

It's only when i see these holes on your skin
The color of your face this morning
That i know you've lived without love
Now that I know you live all alone

Will you get all you've never had
With another needle
Will you try to get some more joy
No matter how
Will you feel all you've never felt
With just one more needle

I thought i had dicovered all your worries
And maybe I will never help you
But I guess you've lived without love

Take this pill, my dear
It will keep you sharp and clear
The side effects won't last too long

It's stranger than it seems
In your most peculiar dreams
But it's nothing that won't fade with time

Tuck the northern star in a candy jar
And save it for a rainy day

Shadows in the moonlight
Always coming, always going
While your cup is overflowing

Shadows in the moonlight
Just a matter of perspective
It's all relative, subjective
It's alive

Stand up straight and tall
Keep your back against the wall
Remember what they said to you

A stranger in a crowd
A halo on a cloud
It's lost to you but it never really went away

The muffled speech is out of reach
But truth has got a way of breaking through

(Chorus)
Take these words my dear
And as they echo in your ears
It's closer than you think

(Chorus x 2)

You called us animals
We found the right and used it
Kingdom of cannibals
It's fight or flight
Our strife continues on
We shared your ancestors
You kept us caged like monsters
Simian manifold
It's fight or flight
Our strife continues on
You found the might in
Your opposing thumbs
But our battle's begun
Just a step on the rung
Thought you buried my brain
All your efforts in vain
But our battle's begun
Now you're biting your tongue
All the world is your stage
Until you rattled my cage
Now that your missing link was
Found in the shackled chain
Death to the noble savage
Life to the spoils of Kane
Prodigal Caesar rising
Rolling in leaves of rage
Swinging on vines you'll find him
Locked in his human cage
Dragging this out through centuries
Paleolithic maze
Caught in an endless circle
Chased in a fossilled craze
Corpus of ill-intention
Oedipus bound in chains
Bored of his new inventions
Bankrupt for all his pains

Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, come go along with me
Before we get married some pleasures to see

She jumped up behind him and away they did go
She jumped up behind him and away they did go
Down into the valley that was far below

He rode her over hills and valleys so deep
He rode her over hills and valleys so deep
Pretty Polly mistrusted and then began to weep

They went a little further and what did they spy?
They went a little further and what did they spy?
But a newly-dug grave with a spade lying by

Oh Willy, hey Willy, I'm afraid of your ways
Oh Willy, hey Willy, I'm afraid of your ways
I'm afraid you will lead my poor body astray

Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, your guess is about right
Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, your guess is about right
I've dug on your grave the better part of last night

She knelt down before him pleading for her life
She knelt down before him pleading for her life
Please let me be a single girl if I can't be your wife

Then he stabbed her in the heart till her heart's blood did flow
He stabbed her in the heart till her heart's blood did flow
And into the grave Pretty Polly did go

He threw something over her and turned to go home
He threw something over her and turned to go home
Leaving nothing behind him but the girl left to mourn

He went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
He went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
I killed Pretty Polly and tried to get away

Now gentlemen and ladies, I bid you farewell
Now gentlemen and ladies I bid you farewell
For killing Pretty Polly my soul will go to hell

I went on board to serve my king
Leaving my dearest dear behind
She oftimes swore her heart was mine
As I lay smiling in her arms
I thought I held ten thousand charms
With embraces kind and a kiss so sweet
Saying We'll be married when next we meet
As I was sailing on the sea
I took a kind opportunity
Of writing letters to my dear
But scarce one word from her did hear
As I was walking up London Street
I shoved a letter from under my feet
Straight lines being wrote without any blot
Saying seldom seen is soon forgot
I went up to her father's hall
And for my dearest dear did call
She's married, sir, she's better for life
For she has become a rich man's wife
If the girl is married, whom I adore
I'm sure I'll stay on land no more
Straight lines being wrote without any blot
Saying seldom seen is soon forgot
So come young lads take a warn from me
If in love you'll ever be
For love is patient,love is kind
Just never leave your love behind

Saddle up my dapple-gray

Keep a steady pace all day
Singing my sweet song
Riding through the purple hills
Just like Roy and Dale
All along, along along

Then I�ll stake my claim
Send it all to Laura
Shower her like rain
Hurry back on home to her
Speeding o�er the rail
All along, along along

The Cruel War
The cruel war is raging, Johnny has to fight
I long to be with him from morning 'till night
I want to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you? No, my love, no
Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
That your captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you? No, my love, no
I'll tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
I'll pass for your comrade as we march along
I'll pass for your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me come with you? No, my love, no
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny, I feel you are unkind
I love you far better than all of mankind
I love you far better than words can e'er express
Won't you let me come with you? Yes, my love, yes
They marched into battle, she never left his side
'Til a bullet shell struck her and love was denied
A bullet shell struck her, tears came to Johnny's eyes
As he knelt down beside her, she silently died

If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly up the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

If I met your man, who was long and tall
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

When I wore my apron low
Couldn't keep you from my do'
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now I wear my apron high
Scarcely ever see you passing by
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now my apron's up to my chin
You pass my door and you won't come in
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home in my mama's bed
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

Way-hay, up she rises
Way-hay, up she rises
Way-hay, up she rises
Early in the morning
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Pull out the plug and wet him all over
Put him in the bilge and make him drink it
Put him in a leaky boat and make him bale her
Tie him to the scuppers with the hose pipe on him
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Tie him to the topmast while she's yardarm under
Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline
Keel haul him 'til he's sober
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!

[A] Follow the [Em] drinking gourd!
[A] Follow the [Em] drinking gourd
For the [G] old man is [D] waiting to [C] carry you to [D] freedom
[Em] Follow the [D] drinking [Em] gourd
The old man in this chorus was Peg Leg Joe, a sailor-turned-carpenter who had lost part of his right leg in an accident at sea. Joe wintered in the South doing odd jobs, from plantation to plantation. When he wasn't working he taught the slaves this song containing a secret escape route to freedom in the North
The Drinking Gourd is not a gourd, but the Big Dipper with its two pointer stars (Dubhe and Merak) that visually lead to the North Star
By following the North Star the slaves were able to consistently navigate northward
When the sun comes back and the first quail calls
Follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is waiting to carry you to freedom
If you follow the drinking gourd
Each year when the quails migrated south, the slaves were told to begin their journey northward, which entailed crossing the unnavigable Ohio River. It was too swift and wide to cross, except in winter, when it was frozen and slaves could walk to the other shore on the ice
The riverbank makes a very good road
The dead trees will show you the way
Left foot, peg foot traveling on
Following the drinking gourd
Peg Leg Joe marked one bank of the Tombigbee River in Mississippi with his easily identifiable footprints. By following them and the dead trees along the riverbank, the slaves could have a safe journey free from plantation owner's hounds
The river ends between two hills
Follow the drinking gourd
There's another river on the other side
Follow the drinking gourd
When the Tombigbee ended, the slaves were told to continue northward, over the hills, to the Tennessee River where the Underground Railroad would help them
-
[Em] When the sun goes back and the [C] first quail calls
[Em] Follow the [D] drinking [Em] gourd
[Em] The old man is a-waitin' for to [C] carry you to freedom
[Em] Follow the [D] drinking [Em] gourd
[A] Follow the [Em] drinking gourd!
[A] Follow the [Em] drinking gourd
For the [G] old man is [D] waiting to [C] carry you to [D] freedom
[Em] Follow the [D] drinking [Em] gourd
The river bed makes a mighty fine road
Dead trees to show you the way
And it's left foot, peg foot, traveling on
Follow the drinking gourd
CHORUS
The river ends between two hills
Follow the drinking gourd
There's another river on the other side
Follow the drinking gourd

I thought I heard the angels say
Follow the drinking gourd
The stars in the heavens gonna show you the way

They signed us with a whaling crew
For the icy Greenland ground
They said we'd take a shorter way
While we was outward bound brave boys
While we was outward bound
Oh the lookout up in the barrel stood
With a spyglass in his hand
There's a whale there's a whale there's a whale he cried
And she blows at every span brave boys
And she blows at every span
The captain stood on the quarter-deck
And the ice was in his eye
Overhaul overhaul let your davit tackles fall
And put your boats to sea brave boys
And put your boats to sea
Well the boats got down and the men aboard
And the whale was full in view
Resolve resolve let these whaler men know
To see where the whale fish blew brave boys
To see where the whale fish blew
Well the harpoon struck, the line ran out
The whale give a floody with his tail
And he upset the boat, we lost half a dozen men
No more, no more Greenland for you brave boys
No more no more Greenland for you
Bad news bad news the captain said
And it grieved his heart full sore
But the losing of that hundred pound whale
Oh it grieved him ten times more brave boys
Oh it grieved him ten times more
Oh Greenland is a dreadful place
A land that's never green
Where the cold winds blow and the whale fish go
And the daylight's seldom seen brave boys
And the daylight's seldom seen

A snap, crackle, a fizzling sound
My skin itches and twitches around
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna feel you

Desse povo dançando
Mexe com meu pé
Faz a cabeça girar
A força que move o mundo

Perseguimos a luz

Andamos à luz do luar
Balançando a vida nos leva
Pensamentos que trazem
O chão fugindo a seus pés
Madrugada a virar

Skeletons and Spirits

Words & Music by Allison Crowe

Take your sympathy and shove it
As for the pain
Well, I love it
I'll eat your words
I'll devour your soul
I will laugh like a lemur
As you crawl back into your hole

I won't deny you
But I'll pay you no heed
And, if you keep stabbing me
I will probably bleed
But, I'll pretend I'm a cloud
And my rain will surround you
And if you keep hurting me
I'll eventually drown you

And, yes I know
I'm a little bit off

But, you, you can't leave, you can't open the door
You think you're unique but I've seen you before
So run, run away from the fires that burn
You will do this again and again
But you will never learn

So keep looking down
As you crush me keep smiling
'cause I will get up
And there's no denying
That I am one of your punching clowns
You can keep on striking
But you can't keep me down

You always think that you
Are fearless and right
But I think that you
Are afraid in the night
Of the ghosts, of the spirits
That crawl into your head
Of the skeletons that'll haunt you
Until you're dead

But, now, you can't leave, you can't open the door
You think you're unique but I've seen you before
So run, run away from the fires that burn
You will do this again and again and again and again

But, now, you can't leave, you can't open the door
You think you're unique but I've seen it all before
So run, run away from the fires that burn
But you will never learn
You will never learn
You will never learn

[Verse 1]
I'm the sweet taste that makes you lick your lips
I'm the reason you and your parents won't speak again
I'm your new drug the one that makes you weak
I'm the warning label you've chosen not the read
We both know what we're getting into, this is wrong

[Chorus]
I, I wanna be the one that understands you
The one you telephone to reassure you
You should know that this will never end well
It's gonna get harder
Babe, I wanna be the one under the sheets
Conduct a symphony that makes you scream
You should know that this this will never end well
It's gonna get harder

[Bridge]
Complicated, complicated
Complicated, complicated
Complicated, complicated
Complicated

[Verse 2]
[?]
The one who knows your body
I'm half way out the door while you fall asleep
I'm addicted to keeping you on the [?]
Something inside you  is telling you this isn't right
You keep ignoring and I can't avoid it
We both know this is wrong

[Chorus]

I could go out in the darkness hear you calling my name
I hear you shouting hear you calling but it's not the same
And every word that you are throwing right into my back
It doesn't matter to me because I'm keeping my track

Let me go
Stop talking, let me go

Our time together always ended up in war
Every whisper made you jealous and that from the start
It's nice to see you shouting after throwing me out
No excuses but this time it's gonna be the last

Let me go
Oh baby, let me go

Now I go out in the darkness smiling back at your face
With a nice and cozy feeling after leaving your place
This road will lead me somewhere I don't really now
But it's somewhere someone always makes my day somehow

Let me go
Stop shouting, let me go
Let me go
Oh Baby let me go

"
13557,
13558,"

I’m counting backwards
The days to finally
Be there with you
Could this be true?

And while I’m waiting
I grab a pencil and
Think about you
With me there too

And all I do is try try try
To write a song of you and I
So you can sing to me at night
To my ear
Don’t worry we’ll have time time time
I’ll fall asleep into your arms
So I can listen to your heart all nights

He tied me to the pole
And the steel up my back was cold
And the rope cut into my hands
That were tied behind me
And he told me to please not cry
Because then he’d want to see why
Why I’d cry
And anyway only little girls cry
Maybe that's what I was
He said he thought I was a girl
And there was only one way to find out
And if you want, go ahead and shout
Rubbing my chest, he asked what’s next?
And undid my belt and my pants
And while the others watched
I cried for another chance
I asked God for another chance
But God only watched
And I thought the clock would never stop
And wonder why today
That I am this way
And God only knows
That it always shows
Like a needle in the hay
A boy got lost and a girl found her way
That day

I left a trail of myself every place that I have been through
And going bald is the most manly thing that I'm ever gonna do
I tell the earth, ""thanks for the hair, thanks for the skin, thanks for the bone""
Though I now slowly give it back I still appreciate the loan
Just tell me that you like me in the same sentence as a mountain side
'Cause it would be such a relief to be objectified
'Cause who says it's so important to sort through these thoughts of ours
Maybe be that's why we love to try to see ourselves from the outside
In photographs and videos and diaries and mirrors
'Cause it would be such a relief to be objectified
And the closest that I ever got still seems to leave a lot to go
But the horizon seems to be a place that nobody can know
Looking forth and looking back, our vision can't extend beyond the quaint vanishing points our bodies' recommend
And I'll help you move some furniture somewhere it's never been before, but the room's so small the dresser drawer won't let us get back out the door
Just tell me that you like me in the same sentence as the building
It would be such a relief to...
I'm just a natural thing
We're only boats
And the boats are only empty
And you can't blame an empty boat that's on a river to the sea
You can't blame a billion boats without a sail, without a sailor
And that's how we look in photographs, and diaries, and mirrors
And the plants turn into ants, and the ants turn into plants
And children are clumsy people, and old people are rotting Children
And I still don't have a cell phone, but this sea shell gets Reception
And the ocean won't stop calling, and I want a restraining order
Just tell me that you like me in the same sentence as a building
It would be such a relief to see I'm just a natural thing
We're just a natural thing
Just like anything

"
13764,

I lay down every night
And I can't get no rest
'Cause it starts spinning in my brain
And then it's pounding in my chest
What if I've wasted all my youth?
What if I've wasted growing up?
What if I wasted my whole life?
Oh man, I feel like throwing up

It's an anxiety attack
An anxiety attack
I've got a bad case of the horrors
And at night it comes back

'Cause first I look back at my week
And then I look back at my year
And then I'm terrified to speak
And then I'm paralyzed with fear
And I'm tossing and I'm turning
And I'm going 'round the bend
And all I see are all my failings
Downward spirals without end
And I see horror in the future
And I see horror in the past
And it's 4am and 5am, 6am at last

'Cause what if I never feel grown up
And die in a car accident?
And what if I go crazy
And what if this time it's permanent?
And what if I go broke
And have to move back with my parents?
And then what if I get cancer
And I ain't got no insurance?

All my days are moving faster
And it's making me feel dizzy
How come I get nothing done
But always feel so busy?
And I used to feel so smart
You know, I used to feel so strong
But this just can't be how to live
I must be doing something wrong
Because everything I might do
Feels like something else I can't
And then another day is gone
And I just don't know where it went

I try not to hang out too much
Try not to watch too much television
But still everything I do
Just seems to be the wrong decision
And I lay down every night
But still I can't get no rest
'Cause it starts spinning in my brain
And then it's pounding in my chest

It's an anxiety attack
An anxiety attack
I've got a bad case of the horrors
And at night it comes back

"
13766,"

I think if life exists
It's probably like this
I had a common goal
I caught a common cold
I said when I get healthy
I won't take it for granted
And I really thought I meant it but I knew when I got better that I'd probably forget it
Feeling fine wasn’t worth a mention
So I didn’t pay attention

And it seems that’s just the way
Its all easier said that done
And it's not even easy to say

And when I get back home
I'll see what's left before I'd gone
A thousand sheets of paper
I'll see what they are later
And then I've gotta roam
And back and forth I've flown
And when I get back home I'll see what's left before I've gone
Two thousand sheets of paper
I'll see what they are later

Well it’s hard to get too bored
When you pick the right two chords
And you keep on strumming
As if you don’t know what’s coming

Now I don’t have a girlfriend and I wish I was more happy
Now I have a girlfriend and I wish I was more happy
Now I have two girlfriends and I wish I was more happy
Now I have four girlfriends and I wish I was more happy
And when I'm in an airplane
I close my eyes and pretend
That it’s a rocket pointed straight down
Shooting at the earth again
Now I am more happy and I wish I was more happy
If I was a little smarter
If I worked a little harder
But emotions in the brain
They'll always be the same
It's just chemicals and blob
And what you've got is what you've got
And you just apply it to whatever's passing by it

Just like the guitar pick that I could not keep in my grip
It's like all the love I lose 'cos I could never fill the shoes
But it's just because I have no feet
And then I think every minute of every day I have a choice
To wish things could be better or be glad things aren't be worse
And maybe every minute of every day we have the choice
To say, ""Things could be better,"" or to say, ""Things could be worse.""

And I think if life exists
It's probably like this
But it’s hard to get too bored
When you pick the right two chords
And you keep on strumming
As if you don’t know what's coming
And it seems that’s just the way
It's all easier said that done
And it's not even easy to say

[Intro] [Kid talking] (Majik Most):
Hey yeah, I just need a haircut. Yeah, like maybe a little bit off the top, like a trim
(Yeah, I can give you a haircut. I'm A FUCKIN' BARBER!)
Naw, naw just like a trim. (Yeah). Just a little bit off the top
(Yeah I know what the fuck I'm doin'. Just sit down in the chair.)
Well, okay but...you know I just want a little bit off the sides, like a trim
(Yeah, I'll cut you real nice.)
Yeah okay, OOOWW MY HEAD!

[Verse One]
You want a Majik Most logo carved in your fro?
Awww, my hand slipped, now you look just like Bobbito
It's not me bro, these scissors are messed up
Rusted shut, let me oil up the clippers
I'll clip your neck quicker when I drink a little liquor
I might lop your ear off, aaawww stop actin' soft
Sit still
Don't you dare move or cough
Or you'll look like Robocop when he took his helmet off
The nerve of this guy
To say, ""Move faster.""
He left with a skin fade disaster
Uhhh
""You want a Meximullet?""
""Yeah, what's that?""
""Like that Mexican cat with long hair on the back.""
Or that other guy Zach, from Saved By The Bell
You'll Screetch when I reach for my razor from Hell
It's bloody and old and got mold on the side
You wanted a part?
Well, now you got five

[Hook]
You better tuck in those ears before I swing these sheers
I've been doin' this for years, just sit down in that chair
A little off the top? Now a chop off that block
Give you a crew cut, now you strut like a gay cop

[Verse Two]
You want a Little Richard helmet?
Huuum, let's do this
Leave you lookin' like a Buddhist with a balding cap
Fuck Rogaine kid, your hair is never coming back
Believe me black
Yo, you'll be embarrassed
I'll leave you semi-hairless, lookin' like Ed Harris
I'm careless with this
Deranged, gone mad
I'll grab the scissors and stab all in your shag
I hate when cats wanna talk and conversate
I'll give you a mohawk and say it looks great
I'll use a Flowbee on a white kid named Toby till he looks like Moby
(JESUS, I JUST WANTED A HAIRCUT!)
Fuck up your identity like Das EFX chemotherapy
Slice your scalp, give your wig to charity
It's scary, cause you're lucky when I cut you when I'm sober
Leavin' cats with comb overs from here to Oklahoma

[Hook]

""As a barber I don't just cut hair. I listen, I get to know my clients
The most important part in being a barber is my ability to remember details
About each customer.""
""Oh hey, watch that birth mark, OW! Jesus Christ!""
""I told you to hold still.""
""Jesus Christ are you a barber or a butcher? I'm bleeding like a stuffed pig here.""

""Like a fucked up barber, I'll push your wig farther."" - Mobb Deep
""When the clippers touched my hair they blew the fuck up."" - Jeru The Damaja
""Catchin' more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber."" - GangStarr

""Straight up gettin' your hair cut gave me ?""

[Outro] [Majik Most & Celph Titled talking]
[MM] Yeah, Majik Most. A deranged fuckin' barber. Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yo
I'll leave you with an Omar Epps/Gumby head
[CT] Naw kid, Pat Sajak
[MM] Ha ha, naw no I'll make you look like Lyle Lovett and you'll love it
[CT] Pat Riley oil spills!
[MM] Naw, naw, naw, naw, yo, I'll leave you with Buzz Aldrin buzz cut
[CT] Fuck you up like Dauber from Coach, kid. Mop head

Je moet niet bemoeien, Je bent niet m'n kaliber
I am the one, maar ben geen Justin Bieber
En die liefde is leuk, maar m'n geld heb ik liever
Matties worden viezer, willen van je stelen als zwieber
En de maffia hier sturen die blauwe brieven
En betaal je ze niet, kan je zitten als dieven
Eisen helft van je money die ze niet eens verdienen
Hou die bal hoog niffo bhel we zijn aan het tienen
Jullie zijn met ze tienen
Eenmans in de scene, nee ik hoef niet te teamen
En we drinken geen lean, op m'n doel kan ik leanen
Ben m'n eigen baas niffo alleen God zal ik dienen
Ik kan werken met jou als je mij wat hebt te bieden
Heb gelachen met mensen die willen dat we verliezen
Hart ijskoud nu, heb hem in laten vriezen
Je kan slagen in het leven, maar je moet ervoor kiezen

Zie ze staan met één leger, maar het zijn geen soldaten
Wou het achter me laten, maar ik kan het niet laten
Ga niet met ze in zee, Ik vertrouw geen piraten
Als we knallen gaan we hard niffo, net als nitraten
Het moet gaan over geld, anders kom ik niet praten
Doe dit niet voor de shine, want dat kan me niet raken
Niffo hier doen we zaken, heb je dat in de gaten ?
Hun verdediging heeft gaten, dat is wat ze vergaten
God zou over me waken
Alles wat ik heb zal ik met m'n leven bewaken
Want ik leef in me droom en ik kan niet onwaken
Man zijn is de code dat ze niet kunnen kraken
Overleggen met niemand, wij verdelen de taken
Bedtijd voor rappers, wij verdelen de lakens
Alles hier is geen toeval want hier spelen we schaken
En ze zetten geen stappen, daarom bleven ze haken

Break my arm on the back of the chair
I don't care who you tell
What I tell you to do to my face
In the night
In the back
Of the car
'Cause It never hurt, never hurt
Never hurt the fuck at all

I don't know who the king of the prom was
And I don't even think I remember your name anymore
It's okay
It really don't matter at all to me

This is not my fucking war
But i'm gonna fight it anyway
This is not my fucking gun
But I'm gonna fire it
This is not my fucking god
But I'm gonna bow to him anyway
This is not my fucking song
But I'm gonna sing it
This is not my fucking dick
But i'm gonna suck it anyway
This is not my fucking life
But i don't give a fuck... Fuck... FUCK

This is not (x 14)

Here she comes
Walking to me
Forever lost
She's all i can see
Blinded by her perfect skin
Why won't she let me in
So cold she's walking by me
Invisible she cannot see me
Blinded by too many eyes
She'll never see that i never see that i
Live for her smile
For her smile
Trying hard but she won't notice
I would die for just one kiss
Walking by and i'll catch her eye
Then she'll know that i
Stay awake when i should be sleeping
What secret can she be keeping
Where does her heart belong
When will all hope be gone
And will she know that i
Live for her smile
For her smile
For her smile
For her smile

Alone in dreams is all i know all
I know
Can't see your face again
Your face in dreams
Without end
Without end
No i'll never see your sparkling eyes again oh no
And i'll never kiss your sweetest lips again oh no
So afraid i'd lie into your eyes
If i said I would never make you cry
Never make you cry
You had to walk away
And all the brightness turned to gray
Turned to gray
I wonder what good it does
Memories of all that was
All that was
No i'll never see your sparkling eyes again
And i'll never touch your softest skin again
Oh no

Sun rays come down
As seen when they hit the ground
Children spinning around
Til' they fall down down down

I wait for you
It's been two hours now
And you're still somewhere in town
Your dinner's getting cold

I rest my case
You are always this late
And you know how much I hate
Waiting around, round, round

Bitter heart, bitter heart
Tries to keep it all inside
Bitter heart, bitter heart
Shadows will help you try to hide
Bitter heart my bitter heart
Is getting just a little fragile
Bitter heart bitter heart
Of mine

And then you come
And tell me the same reason
That you did yesterday
So tell me what's her name

Life is a vaccum pump, always sucking me dry (x2)
Anyway, I love you anyway you say
And you lie on the bed
The sheets are crumpled around your head
Maybe thats how we meet
We need to feel that we're complete
Communicate or die through it
Sometimes thats the lie of it
These things we shouldn't do
Always end up destroying you
Anyway, I love you anyway you say

This is a new york story (x3)
Anyway, I love you anyway you say
Sucking me dry

And the salt and the sugar on your table
They enable us to do these stupid things we do
These lives we steal aren't even true
My fantasy was never you
And the blood is blossoming like flowers
Up inside the glass
Eating up our living hours
Draining us of all our powers
Its obvious, I know
One of us should really go
Step outside the door
Run away and be the cure

This is a new york story (x3)
Anyway, I love you anyway you say
Sucking me dry

And the lies and the legacies
And all those wasted destinies
Your body is so cold
Its turning blue, you look so old
Not human anymore
I think we've lost this hopeless war
And you're soiled and spoiled and so lost my friend
I think that this could be the end
But fear we'll do it all again
And i can pour cold water onto you
And your eyes open and see right though
You suddenly look so gray
Look me in my eyes and say
Anyway

This is a new york story (x3)
Anyway, I love you anyway you say
How do you deal? (how do I deal?) (x3)

Send us a signal, give us a sign
The needle's on empty, but she swore everything would be fine
But it's on fire, and there's bees in the walls
They're buzzing so loud that I swear I miss every one of my calls

So do it with smoke, do it with light
But whatever you do, just make sure that it's strong and it's bright
Cause it feels like the end
But I now and then overreact
They've been saying that since way back when the moon turned to blood and made rivers all over your back now

This whole world conviction and a lifetime of wonder
The creeping suspicion that it's all soon going under
Bought all my sandals from that landslide in the small town
The wax from the candle's on the strap of her costume ballgown
It comes through the windows just like radiation, it penetrates like a saber
And according to all my calculations, the sickness will descend in even gradations, defying the preacher's evaluations
Now is always better than later

Go get the door, send them away
This is not a good time and it doesn't look like a good day
Cause the house has the odds, they're a hundred to one
That you will decay in your tracks and you'll blind as you stare at the sun
Just making it's rounds and increasing the dread
That each morning you leave slightly more of yourself in the bed

But the radio's on and it's turning my heart into gold
And the guilt I once had is gone, it's replaced by a fear dying before I get old now

The scent of the decay will stay with you all of your life
The way that the blood still, decades later, stains your pen knife
It's 10:59 according to the clock at the station
Oh, what a perfect time to begin making accusations
It's easy to forget, but it's tough to lose, like the color of your complexion
Blends in so nicely with purples and blues and most of the time it's disguised as a bruise
It sleeps under the skin as the good life accrues

If breathing's the error, it's the simplest correction
Oh, cause of breathing's the error, it's the simplest correction

Whoa I drink pots and pots and pots and pots of strong black coffee
Trying to keep my sleepy soul awake
But the sleepiness still comes along and when it does its fast and strong
I end up with a bad case of the shakes

And my baby tells me honey cut it out
Cuz she's familiar with the bend before the break
But she's in this runaway with me and by god were doing fifty
Comin' round that hairpin turn atop of wolf creek

Now I called Olly Olly Olly Olly Oxen Free
Tryin' to draw god out from his hiding place
Either he can't hear what I'm saying or he just got sick of playing
Either way, I'll be calling out like this for days

And the cadence and the chords are all the same
So I get anthem from a child in the streets
And you know he ain't much for singing, but by god he's good at swinging
And that's the reason that he won't stay obsolete

And that's why he's singing, how, how long, how long must I wait
He's singing, how, how long, how long will this whole thing take
Cuz everyday… it's getting tougher to shoot straight

Now I've read page, after page, after page, after smeared page
About this killer instinct inside of me
But love it, or hate it, praise it or berate it
It's just what comes out most naturally

And they warn me kid you'll run it in the ground
If you keep on saying all the same things the same way
But I ain't trying to make friends
I'm just trying to make this story end

And if you're drinking then you don't got time to plead

And that's why I'm singing, how, how long, how long, must I wait
I'm singing, how, how long, how long will this whole thing take

I've been told that the tallest building in hell has an awesome view of the emerald city

In the fall we can go huntin' down by the banks of old Mill Creek
Oh, you're guns all rusted out and mine's just made for shooting skeet
Oh, we can leave 'em in the truck and take two pints of Wild Turk
And when they ask us what we got, we'll say, ""Well, we got out of work""

And either you got longer legs or you got bigger lungs
Cause I know for a fact we done the same amount of drugs
And I'm lying in a heap on the side of the trail
While you take the shortcuts up to the top of the hill

But anyway, I'm terrified of heights
You gotta climb it alone
But when you get to the top, won't you holler back down
What's it look like up there?
I always kinda wanted to know
Woah, woah

Well, I got me a stereo I keep kinda low
Until a good song comes on, and then I kinda let her go
There's still music out there that warms my insides
It makes my days a tiny little bit more demiserified
Like right now Bob Wills and his Playboys are talking
Bout how the big man gets the money while the little one picks the cotton
And the big fish eats the little fish, but that little fish was really bait
And I eat that big fish up with a silver spoon and a paper plate
The utensil I received from my mother and dad
But the plate I made myself with my own two hands
And I don't mind either one just as long as nobody knows
Woah, woah

Well, I remember the day with my brother and his best friend
They burst into my room looking like the world come to an end
They said there's a fire on the hill, but it's near the reservoir
We can put it out but we gotta take mom and dad's car
And I cursed both
And then I said lets go
Woah, woah

You're giving me that look that says you're in it deep
Unless that's the look that says tonight don't plan on any sleep
I guess I'll take my chances with the one, hold out hope for the other
But girl, oh, wait a second, that smile's kinda blowing your cover
And we're sucking in the wind and snow through the cracks between our smiles
Making tracks back to the village, though we still got a couple miles
Where we can sharpen up our fangs, flatten out our feathers
And thank the good lord up above for this god awful weather

And if it's too good just tell me, I'll do something wrong
But I'm thinking that you're winking cause you kinda like this song
And that bottle of Sangria wasn't such a bad idea after all
Woah, woah

I was laying on the floor when you were gone
Like it was something I could die from
Now my head aches and your friends all think I'm dumb
You said it's just a bit of bad blood

I don't feel great but it doesn't bother me
Because I don't have the energy
And the X-ray doesn't tell me anything
Or show me what the hell you see in me

All my time has turned to days
That I will waste till my dying day
And all my bones have realigned
And now I guess it was a bad sign

I was praying to the Lord for some fun
But I guess He didn't have some
And betraying everything that I'd become
Just to prove it wasn't true love

If I'm too late will you come and hurry me
Like a kid among the dying leaves
If my heart breaks will you drug and carry me
Where we can talk about our chemistry

All my time has turned to days
That I will waste till my dying day
And when I tried I was ashamed
And said I don't believe in saving face
And all my clothes are still inside
And broken up into little piles
And all my bones have realigned
And now I guess it was a bad sign
Now I guess it was a bad sign
And now I guess it was a bad sign

[Verse 1]
Heya Tom, it's Bob from the office down the hall
Good to see you buddy, how've you been?
Thing have been OK for me, except that I'm a zombie now
I really wish you'd let us in
I think I speak for all of us when I say I understand
Why you folks might hesitate to submit to our demand
But here's an FYI: you're all gonna die screaming!

[Chorus]
All we want to do is eat your brains
We're not unreasonable; I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes
All we want to do is eat your brains
We're at an impasse here--maybe we should compromise:
If you open up the doors
We'll all come inside and eat your brains!

[Verse 2]
I don't want to nitpick, Tom, but is this really your plan?
To spend your whole life locked inside a mall?
Maybe that's OK for now, but someday you'll be out of food and guns
And then you'll have to make the call
I'm not surprised to see you haven't thought it through enough
You never had the head for all that bigger-picture stuff
But Tom, that's what I do, and I plan on eating you slowly!

[Chorus]
All we want to do is eat your brains
We're not unreasonable; I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes
All we want to do is eat your brains
We're at an impasse here--maybe we should compromise:
If you open up the doors
We'll all come inside and eat your brains!

[Bridge]
I'd like to help you, Tom, in any way I can
I sure appreciate the way you're working with me
I'm not a monster, Tom, well, technically I am
I guess I am...

[Verse 3]
I've got another meeting, Tom--maybe we could wrap it up?
I know we'll get to common ground somehow
Meanwhile, I'll report back to my colleagues, who were chewing on the doors
I guess we'll table this for now
I'm glad to see you take constructive criticism weII
Thank you for your time, I know we're all busy as hell
And we'll put this thing to bed, when I bash your head open!

[Chorus]
All we want to do is eat your brains
We're not unreasonable; I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes
All we want to do is eat your brains
We're at an impasse here--maybe we should compromise:
If you open up the doors
We'll all come inside and eat your brains!

Code Monkey get up, get coffee
Code Monkey go to job
Code Monkey have boring meeting
With boring manager Rob
Rob say Code Monkey very diligent
But his output stink
His code not ""functional"" or ""elegant""
What do Code Monkey think?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Code Monkey think maybe manager want to write god-damned login page himself
Code Monkey not say it out loud
Code Monkey not crazy, just proud

Code Monkey like Fritos
Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew
Code Monkey very simple man
With big warm fuzzy secret heart
Code Monkey like you
Code Monkey like you

Code Monkey hang around at front desk
Tell you sweater look nice
Code Monkey offer buy you soda
Bring you cup, bring you ice
You say no thank you for the soda cause
Soda make you fat
Anyway you busy with the telephone
No time for chat

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Code Monkey have long walk back to cubicle
He sit down pretend to work
Code Monkey not thinking so straight
Code Monkey not feeling so great

To get out this place

See your soft pretty face
Much rather wake up, eat a coffee cake
Take bath, take nap

Even pretty girl like you
Code Monkey just waiting for now

I get up early when the sleeping pill wakes me
I take a wake up pill and fill with energy
I power on hard and I check my messages
But I don't have any messages
I take a driving pill and head to my car
I drive around a bit 'cause work isn't very far
I call my phone and I check my messages
But I don't have any messages

All I know is driving on drugs feels better when they're prescription
All I know is the world looks beautiful, the world looks so damn beautiful

I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now
I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now

Work is anything but quiet these days
I try to medicate my concentration haze
I can see the day unfold in front of me
So I take the stairs and hit the gym
The phone is ringing when I get to my desk
What was a stinging's now a sharp pain in my chest
So I take a Calminex and just chill
And then it's time for lunch again

All I know is work is easy when you don't stress out about deadlines
All I know is I take my medicine I always take my medicine

And I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now
I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now...

Sometimes I'd like to slow things down
And enjoy the moment
But when I look the moment's gone

Work is over but I can't stay to work late
Got to leave and get ready for my second date
With a pretty girl that I met at the pharmacy
Right in the prescription line
I take a pill for my social anxiety
I get a table and a nice bottle of Chablis
Now it's getting late and there's still no sign of her
I have another glass of wine

All I know is the wine lasts longer when you don't gotta share it with someone
All I know is the steak tastes better when I take my
Steak-tastes-better pill

And I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now
And I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now

Lick sweet the taste you have
Sin is far behind
Lust is all we know
You swallow the love I give you
Suck it dry
You'll please me like you do it every time
Your sounds of love in the sky
Just like the animal inside
Never-ending thirst
What you want, you'll get
The fire inside me
Will take you now
You'll please me like you do it every time
In me you trust
How could I let you down?
What we got
Not everybody has
This kind of knife
Will cut through anything
Until we die
We'll kill the time like this
Lover, I hear your call
Wait for me, I won't be long
Tell me why you cry
Oh, it breaks my heart
Don't you suffer
Just lay down
And I'll please you like I do it every time

What means hallucinate?
What are we supposed to see?
What are they supposed to want?
Get a job!
You scare me

I sing here
I'm alone here
I'm with you over here

Marshmallow brain
I need an umbrella
If I'm gonna stand in the rain

My hands are cupped and full of blood and eyes is spirals
I am on my knees and praying
That is how I pray cause that is how you pray
Rat rat rat rat rat rat, huh!

Tongue thickens, I am with those who eat drugs
Who peek over the wall and get shocked
Shocking is therapy
Electrify your head!
Pianos in my hearing
Vincent, my ear is falling off
Who left me alone?
What do you mean you're alone?
Goddamn wolves
No one has that dream

Hallucinate
I need an umbrella
If I'm gonna go insane
I think she wanna be crazy, pick a brain!
I think I'm running away
Oh boy, God?
I'm gonna scare that boy again? Not again

Centerdale to Providence
Middletown to Armageddon
A road is in my dream
Centerdale is in my dream
Drums!
Carry me over the wall
You! left me alone
What do you mean you're alone?
I peek over the wall and get sick
Sickness is therapy
Electrify your head!

Catalyst
I need an umbrella
If I'm gonna slit my wrist

Pick your hands up
Put them on your head
Move it around and say
This is too much
It doesn't fit
Your feet say nothing but move your hips
Move your hips
Move your hips
Rat rat rat rat rat rat

Mania, oh!

This afternoon
Your back's not so straight
Your eyes aren't too clear
I could kiss you for remembering my birthday
Find you on the dock
Out of money, out of luck
You should thank me for remembering your name
You could be very easy

Spin the shotglass
Kiss the bottle
Shark in your brain
Spin the shotglass
Kill the bottle
Shark in your brain
'Cause she's warm
'Cause she's warm
'Cause she's warm

This afternoon
Your bite's not so bad
Your bark's not too scary
I could kiss you for remembering my address
Find you in the dumps
Out of money, out of drugs
You should thank me for offering my mattress
You could be very easy

Spin the shotglass
Kiss the bottle
Shark in your brain
Spin the shotglass
Kill the bottle
Shark in your brain

By fifty I'll ride on your shoulder

Now breath underwater
I'm so glad he's so charmed

Was a man took a hand, cleared the ground
Dug a hole we called home
Sprawled here
Eleven years, forty-four seasons
We came unstuck and it stung

Unstuck-ness flew me
Though the air whispered in my ear
This is chaos and it stings
Tiny strings across the United States
Run from you to me and to everyone we ever breathed with

I don't care if you're sad
I don't care if you're heart is breaking
You soothe me and you turn me on
Speed and sleep

I lock the dogs in the car
And cut across the parking
L'm far away today
But I might as well not be

You quit making mistakes
I might not leave
You quit making mistakes
I might just stay

I have two heads
Where's the man, he's late
One burns, one's sky
Where's the man, he's late
I'm two headed one free one sticky
But is it freedom can burn?
Is sticky ever blue?
For instance where's my husband?
This is what I need why I can't stay
God, this is the devil too bad he's late
I love the smell of beer
The smell of dark, the feel of dark, to feel the rug
To press the rug beneath me
A small party
But is it sinners can burn?
I hear we let them speak
For instance where's my husband
If you're my husband I tell you something
Dance on the devil's roof
Under a devil's moon
I don't care and you don't move

What can I give

Cool place

You rock me into space
You put cake
Down my throat
And in my face
What can I give you
What can I take

Kissing you is like kissing gravel
But feel's like getting off
Kissing you is like sinking
Down into the moss
You look better upside down
You look better lying down

On the move
I can lose
All my sympathy for you
Sitting straight
On the back of mother hate
What can I tell you
What can I say

On my knees
I can see
All your better qualities
So you freeze
I make frozen into heat
What can I tell you
That you'll believe

Kissing you is like kissing gravel
But feels like getting drunk
Kissing you is like sinking
Down into the mud
You look better upside down
You look better lying down

For today
I've arranged
To be just enough deranged
To relax
In the arms of someone strange
I promise you today
I promise you today
I promise you today

Nice limbo you have here
Nice field you have on

Baby go back to your womb

Bead me a necklace
A decade I'll wait

Picture this gun
I'm tired of crying
I'm gonna run
I swear you
Move you
To my pores
I'm not gonna cry anymore

Dead is next door
Dead is next door

You pulled my limbs one by one in your limbo

Keep me awake

With your bright silver frown
You own the town
And I think I need a little poison

I have no secrets
I have no lies
I have nothing to offer
But the middle of the night
And I think you need a little poison

You leak one apple a week to survive
And you still have to ask if you're alive

You have nothing to offer
But police my dreams
Keep me clean
Keep me awake

With your bright yellow gun
You own the sun
And I think I need a little poison

With your bright silver grin
You own sin
And I think I need a little poison
And I think I need a little poison
And I think I need a little poison

Won't ride in cars anymore
It reminds him of blowjobs
That he's a queer

Home is where the heart lies
The heart lies
The heart lies
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home

It's under the strangle of winter
I only love pieces of things that I hate
Like this box, this piece of roof
I can't grasp, can't see true
A piece of past
Days like today
Like a decade ago
Painful to remember like today

I've been here another year, another day
Ocean waving flies and a child
Girl, you complain
To kiss the rotten broken knee

You may be dreaming
You may be bleeding
You may be in this box

A kitchen is a place where you prepare
And clean up
Clean up
Clean up
Clean up

Banging in the night
Ankle deep in mud
I can sleep in mud
I was a kind of hooker
My lover was free

I don't speak I ramble he was a gamble
I just want to own something (young dirty street)
I can sleep with anything and more

Stripped women stripped men
I fall instead of him
I'm useless in the light fo the distance
I could break you for all the right reasons
I could hate you but what have I got

Nobody feels your tongue
Nobody sees you run
Nobody sees you make
Nobody knows your face

Love lives your whim
I'm stripped instead of him
I'm harmless in the light of the distance
I could break you for all the right reasons
I could hate you but what have I got

Nobody sees me old
Nobody feels me cold
Nobody lives my whim
Nobody knows you're him

I roam this head I carm what's left
I hide myself from her love
Nothing make me older but the birthmark on your back
But making babis in the fields
And the birthmark on your shoulder
Making babies in the fields
Makes me older

Banging in fenceposts
Banging in the night
Ankle deep in mud I can sleep in mud
I was a kind of hooker but his lover was me

I don't sleep I ramble my kids was a gamble
I just want to own something (old dirty earth)
I can sleep with anything and more

'cause the birthmark on your shoulder
Making babies in the field
Nothing makes me older; nothing makes me live my life but you
And that mark on your back making babies
In the field

The only car on the raw sheer highway is riding
The stars for him are only coat lining
You cannot sweat a piebald horse and make it a steed
I cannot take your want and make it a need

People keep wasting you
Wasting you
Just to get a taste of you
They’ve been wasting you
Wasting you
Just to get a taste of you

Ted saw a black man’s lips
And a movie star’s blond
He shook her little bobby socks
Until the thrill was gone

Then her legs got blue like kali
And her wet red mouth grew teeth
And no matter how many women died for him
Hughes can get to sleep

He had tasted her
Tasted her
Smiled right into the base of her
He kept racing her
Racing her
And stayed alive outpacing her

Blue bore the quiet land the best that he could
He learned war and silent and understood
The fleshy pages of women wet in the rain
The rising water feeling no pain feeling no pain

Alone waits in him
Aches in him
Takes up more than it makes of him
Alone shakes in him
Hates in him
Thrums in the subway grate of him

Shel gathered rocks and twigs in her skirt
Shel got the tired drug to make her get hurt
She ordered nature to her design
She went to sleep and dream and it felt more fine
It felt more fine

That drug banked on her
Blanked for her
Never bowed to the higher rank in her
It low sank in her
Drank in her
Never bothered with thanking her

They keep wasting me
Wasting me
Eating up more than a taste of me
This time shakes in me
Takes of me
Uses up more than it makes of me

That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers
Wild gamblers
That's all in the past
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye

Learnt to work the saxophone
I, I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long

And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama, ""The Crimson Tide""
(Aah)
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues)
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations
Sensations
That stagger the mind
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home
Learnt to work the saxophone
I, I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long

They call Alabama, ""The Crimson Tide""
(Aah)
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues)
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be
I learnt to work the saxophone
I, I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
(Aah)
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama, ""The Crimson Tide""
(Aah)
Call me Deacon Blues

10 bees, all gold turn into snow
Life's crows and covers ran for show
We come and look down on our knees
Everything gets covered in disease

I got plenty of time but nothing to say
You, you talk all the time and smile all the way

10 bees, all gold turn into snow
Life's crows and covers ran for show
We come and look down on our knees
Everything gets covered in disease

Old unbreaking tide, I hear you
Coming closer, I won't dear you
I know where you bring the inlorn
Give me courage to us love storm

A modern tire in a fiery tree
And our cat bars growing near the sea
And the sharks rise up and bend in the stars
And the light turns hard and crash the yard

And the highways burn and the banks all explode
And the big old bombs turned the back of your throat
And the green lake's dry and the fish all know
And the bees have nothing and the stars below

Beast Antelope grazed the fields today
Beast Lion eats fat and flesh away
Least little bugs clean the bones and say
Without us a price you'd all Pay

Be real slow like a glue
Feast with the hawks and let the hawks feast you
A little piece, a little beast
Clean a little teeth with the tiny little cream priest

I feel low
But now i know that soon go
How and when's what I don't know
When it comes i hope that I'll still glow

Some bees are better off left alone
Some bees feel better off in the throne
Some bees are friendly like you and me
Some bees are lazy

Been round this road so many times
Feel like it's skin is part of mine
This taste of milk is almost gone
Still got my shame, but not for long!
Been wrong so many times before
But never quite like this
And oh, it rained, but the rain all turned to piss

I hope to make it home one day
I doubt that day will come
I know, by now, that my days they're all gone

I'm gonna get my bathing suit on
Gonna get my base face on
Gonna get my hat out of loan
Gonna get my space face on

I'm gonna turn all snakes into bone
Go wishing the stone
Keep the crystal cat cold
Gotta get the throne

Hope my baby
May we meet a beastman
Hold us there
Happy but by one hand

Gonna get my pile of stone
Gonna my loud loud gong
Gonna get my men into rows
You better cover dem toes

Big carrot throne
Let them take a load
The crystal cat gets cold

If I could reveal what I feel for you
And mark my words with a gentle kiss
Like Saint George I'd slay the dragon
Just to find I'd lost

From outside this window there's
Walls between us
And outside is outside and that's
Where I'll be
I'll be wrapped in the morning dew
Just to find you gone

CHORUS:
So pour me a drink from a broken bottle
And fill my glass with the dirty water
What I've lost is gone
What I've gained has no name
And I'll take my leave once more
Ah J'aime mon amour
Ah J'aime mon amour
Fools for love in any language
Sometimes get burned by the heat of beauty
Just to find she's gone

My love is a scar that I wear for you
Like a crown of thorns
Like a bad tattoo
I wear sin, like a ring of beauty
Just to find you've gone

CHORUS

"
14889,"

If you found me lost on your porch one night
Would you take me in and hold me tight?
And wrap a dream around my head
In case I tumble out of bed?
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
If you found me hanging without a prayer
Would you cut me down and lay me there?
And wash the sins off of my hands
So I might get another chance?
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
If I lost the buttons on my coat
And I couldn't find the golden note
Could I use your hands to find the light
So I might make it through the night?
So I count my blessings in this world of sin;
The holes in the wall let the cold come in;
Could I use your skin to keep me warm
So I might make it through the night?
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

[Verse 1]
I walk, I crawl, but I never run
Sometimes I fall away like a setting sun
Well, I swim, I surf, but I never drown
Well, everybody says they love me but I don't know why

[Verse 2]
I watch you walk like a rhythm train
I love the way you kiss, I just can't stand the pain
Well, I believe in truth but sometimes I lie
Well, everybody says they love me but I don't know why
Yeah, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1 - Reprise]
Yeah, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why
Well, I walk, I crawl, but I never run

Well, everybody says they love me but I don't know why
Yeah, I don't know why

I was drunk
I was down
I was wanderin' round my bed
I was drunk
I was down
I was wanderin' round my bed

I called out your name
Called out your name

I was bleedin'
I was exhausted
I was sufferin' from the altitude

Picked up your scent and lost it
Then I suffered from your attitude

I called out your name
Called out your name
Called out your name
Called out your name

I was summoned
By the angels
To be hung beside your picture
Not allowed to feel
To touch
To hold
Forever imprisoned at long
I called out your name
Called out your name
Called out your name
Called out your name

I was drunk
I was down
I was wanderin' round my bed
I was drunk
I was down
I was wanderin' round my bed

I called out your name
Called out your name
Called out your name

There's an ocean between us my love
An ocean of powder and dust
Somehow I was blind
But now I can see

As you walk through this world Rosalie
Every step is one closer to me
As love we will find
What the others can't see
Your letters in mind
I love you Rosalie

Let the world spin you closer to me
Take a chance on us Rosalie
As love we begun
To find a world that is free

I want to dance with you Rosalie
I want to dance with you Rosalie
To the new years' just time
To bring you closer to me
The whispers are mine
Te amro Rosalie

May 17, 1952
Dear Rosie
The happiest Sunday of my life Rosalie:
Spending a nice, quiet day with you at home alone

December 26, 1952
Dear Joe
My darling
I'm so in love with you
I guess you know you left me speechless when you broke the news
Everything went round and round

How I wish days like those 12 would last forever

Ma and Pa aren't too happy about it
But it's harder on them, for I'll be leaving

I hope that soon, my darling, God will make all our dreams come true

I've started to take a long, hard look at all my surroundings
And at all the people I'm so crazy about
It's going to be harder than I thought leaving all this behind

I love you, can't stand being away from you
I love you

Now remember darling
I've been here all my life
But with my Joe at my side
I won't be able to complain

So never take our love Rosalie
You'll never break this love Rosalie
To the new year's just time
That's brought you closer to me
The whispers are mine
Te amro Rosalie

Your letters are mine
I love you Rosalie
I love you Rosalie
I love you Rosalie
I love you Rosalie

My hands are turning numb
But i still gotta strum
My Velvet guitar
And i don't care how long
Might write a sad one
But who's gonna sing them this time

My hands are turning numb
But i still gotta strum
My Velvet guitar
And i don't care how long
Exactly what went wrong
But who's gonna blame him
This time -----

A rooster's in the trees
But he can't crow for me
He's wasted his time
He lost track of how long
Exactly what went wrong
But who's gonna blame him
This time?

I hear her sing for me
But she won't cry for me
I'm wasted, inside -----
She's too cool to come down
And dance to a sad one
But who's gonna blame her this
Time ----------

Not gonna break him down

No, no, Bobby don't
Walk out on me while I'm talkin' to you
No, I know you won't
Steamroll all over my tears
No, no, Bobby don't
Put up your fists in a room full of strangers
No, I know you won't
Dig yourself into a hole

[Chorus]
But I never can tell you anything
You're always starin' at the TV
You never seem to hear a word that I say
Tonight it's the Blue Line all the way

[Verse]
No, no, Bobby don't
Let me reach out just to find that you've gone
No, I know you won't
Let me wake up all alone

[Chorus]
But I never can make you understand
You don't know how to make sense of me
You oughta learn the details some day
Tonight it's the Blue Line all the way

[Verse]
No, no, Bobby don't
Walk out on me while I'm talkin' to you
No, I know you won't
Steamroll all over my tears
I said no, no, Bobby don't
Put up your fists in a room full of strangers
No, I know you won't
Turn over any more trays

[Chorus]
But I never can take you anywhere
So I don't know why I do it any more
Time to bottle up and go home
I'm takin' the Blue Line all alone
No no no, no no no

No no no, no, Bobby don't
Show everyone what a fool I was
No, no, Bobby don't
Show everyone what a fool I was

It's strange the way
You walk behind
Yet seem to lead the way
Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed

I have taken you for a ride
Left you waiting in the car
While I played death games inside
Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed

I have loved in haste
I've been an alley cat and a bumblebee
To your panther, to your wasp
Oh, I have loved
While thinking only of the cost
Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed

I've raised a sick child to your lips
And in asking you to kiss
What I would not kiss
Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed

Well I never thought I'd be
One of those men
With pin-ups on the wall
For all to see
I thought that just was mechanics
Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed

I have taken you for a ride
Left you waiting in the car
While I played death games inside

Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed
Oh I know I
Oh I know I have strayed

Need ya lover just to feel you hand in mine
Holds me over

I'd never thought I'd ever see the end in sight
When life is over

One day, one life, one love I won't deny
We pray and we lie, one curse that never dies
Surrender your mind, and pray to God before you die
One day and one life

Here I am and I can't complain
Inside this struggle I see our worlds collide
Yeah, It doesn't matter
Can't depend on life ever making sense
It's hard to say when I'm running out of time
Yeah, it's almost over

[Chorus 1]

I don't know, if I know when that day will come
The blessing and the curses are not afraid to go

And make-up their face
And wear a pair of shorts and shirt
Dressed in red and white
Black sandals to shade
At the beach
I can bring a wicker basket

For a picnic in aspen
I'd wear a blue fur coat
While we ski down the slopes
In speed toboggans
Our hair wrestling back
At the speed of the sights
The cabins in the forest
At ski lodge imperial

Spotted on the skiing slopes
Our friends can have the others
While we have our own
We'll read stories up late
Red circles on your cheeks
The dark green velvet curtains 7
Around my bed
We can live in switzerland
While it's snowing outside
The bare brown trees
As the sparrow sings
It's winter song

While you lay there in
Soft white sheets
The life of
The living dolls

Long before a garden stood on this site
This was the district that thrives in the night
A hidden hovel of vice and deceit
These ruins would never be a landmark
And all the creatures that dwelled in its dark
They were the finest flower
They were the elite

Flowers and elite of the underground
Hustlers and losers and roustabouts
Beggars competing in damage and strife
Broken down racehorses, deviants galore
Not to mention a cut rate troubadour
A shipwreck clinging onto
His guitar for dear life

Adopted by this tender underworld
Flourished this precious pixie of a girl
Tucked in the heart of this unholy mess
Since she'd been found by a dry riverbed
Swaddled in finest silks and left for dead
Soon she was known all around
By the name of Princess

One fine night, so help me, O Holy Ghost
She slinks in his room and she takes off her coat
She crawls on his lap after closing the door
Blushing a little, she says with a sigh
""It's you that I love and you may if you like
Kiss me on the mouth
And then do even more""

Hold it there, Princess, that's not my style
I don't have the makings of a pedophile
You're only thirteen, and I'm almost thirty years old
That's a big difference and I see no point
In spending the rest of my days in the joint
She answers, ""Oh troubadour
I will not tell a soul""

""Don't push it girl"" comes his mocking reply
""First off you're not my type, and besides
My heart already belongs to a woman""
So Princess burst into tears as she fled
So Princess ran as she bitterly wept
Feeling the burning sting
Of her first rejection

Corruption of a minor did not take place
The singer at dawn, without leaving a trace
Made his escape in the back of a broken-down cart
Of an old farmhand while strumming a tune
Twenty years later, passing by the same room
He feels a twinge of regret
Deep down in his heart

At the end of rainy days
You're startled and you are amazed
But nothing ever seemed to fit
So turn away cause this is it
You're running out of things to say
You hide but you can't run away

And I won't be the one to love you
Oh, when nothing turns out right

You're getting tired of hanging round
So disappear without a sound
Go around, you're living lies
But it could never be disguised

That you, the cause of all my sorrows
You don't have a lot to say
You can see the sun in your bright day

There's a palace of ghosts inside
Your mind and soul that never die
Your brick is burned
You're sitting down
You'll disappear without a sound
And after all you've ruined how
Do you not know it's coming to you now

And I won't be the one to tell you
All the things I want to say
I'll just turn and look the other way
And you, you have a lot to live for
But when nothing turns out right
I won't be the stars in your dark night

Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine
The note he wrote was such a joke, your friends all laugh until they choke
Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine
The note he wrote was such a joke, your friends all laugh until they choke

Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine
The note he wrote was such a joke, your friends all laugh until they choke

Wave me down across the skies, wild, wild eyes
Hold my hand and don't ask why, wild, wild eyes

Wild eyes, wild eyes

Say you'll stay with me tonight, wild, wild eyes
Say you'll hold me till I die, wild, wild eyes

Wild eyes, wild eyes
Wild eyes, wild eyes, wild eyes, wild eyes

Wave me down across the skies, wild, wild eyes
Say you'll hold me till I die, wild, wild eyes

"
15609,"

Now I shouldn't give you one more chance
But my heart just stopped when you asked me to dance
And I know that you hurt me so
But I love you so much I just can't let you go
All my friends say they think I'm crazy
But when I'm with you my mind is hazy, ah-ah-ah, oh no

I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you

Say you love me and you won't tell a lie
But then bright the next day you tell me goodbye
And I know that you hurt my pride
But keep loving me baby just stay by my side
Yeah, I know that I'm being dumb
But when I'm with you my heart is thumping, ah-ah-ah, oh no

I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you
I can't, I can't, can't get over you
I can't, I can't, can't get over you

So you wanna make time for cheating
'Cause I can't stop my heart from beating, ah-ah-ah, oh no
You're so messed up, it's making me crazy, ah-ah-ah, oh no

I can't, I can't, can't get over you
I can't, I can't, can't get over you
I can't, I can't, can't get over you
I can't, I can't, can't get over you

She doesn’t talk like one of those
That’s what makes me sit so close
Shall I compare you to a rose?
Your beautiful and comatose

When you’re flat on your back
Girl, you give me heart attacks
And she doesn’t realise
My girl’s got pretty eyes

And when your hair’s a mess
Sweat dripping down your neck
Let’s get you out ‘that dress
I’ve got something to confess

You make me fall apart
Gave you the keys to my heart
Make me think in cliches
But that don’t matter anyway

Getting drunk on cheap wine
When you wind around my spine
Wanna take you on the northern line
We’re shedding clothes and stealing time

Underneath the weeping willows
Lying, cuddled up to pillows
Think about her when she isn’t there
Tie another bullet in her hair

We’re always courting with disaster
But that’s ok if i can have her
There ain’t no happy ever-after
Just stolen moments filled with laughter

Just a moving image there
Just imagining

From the giggling summer-sun over all the seas
With you; We spoke for days, sunwords
Have we held the many years as tatters fluttering?
When did you came to see what we had become?

Just a moving image there
Just imagining

You and I, we climbed stairs and punched the ball around
Panoramic views as such, we were in clover
Both couplings in disguise and the fire in our minds
Lay waste over the beauty of our labour

Just a moving image there
Just imagining

Our clouds are Sky

Pleading darkness and selling thoughts as forerunners
Speak of the sun and give in to the sound
A self portrait as a drowned man
I am you and you were me, and we both knew how to fall
Sunwords...
We spoke for days
Sunwords

Just a moving image there
Just imagining

"
16242,"

Nothing as dull as hearts that live on their beats
How I retch of this disease

My head bent twisted and turned
Its eyes twisted around
Gold was in the air
Or so it seemed

Almost silver

Sneaking up from behind and the n stating to breathe
At night during dreams
And silver owes the sunshine and so fueled mind and space
Oh, I fed the stars until nothing remained

Gather in the sunset, he still should be told and gagged
Unfortunately, courage lacked

So I danced until the moning when the world begins again
And gold lifts her head

Almost silver

Losing track of rythm, so spare me now of weal and woe
Instead I wished I lost control

So close your eyes and shiver and bury the sky in the sand
A shadeless dream in Shadowland

Hazy life, hazily
Nothing lasts fettered, it burns
Too soon to yield and too much to curse

Sleeping and smiling
My sing-song melody of old
Whispers and hums everytime again

Oh silver eyes and sunshine and meet me there in the flames
At night, everytime again

Seeing is believing but I saw nothing at all
At night and nothing but gold

Almost silver

I wanna go home and I ain't got sufficient clothes
Doggone my bad luck soul
Wanna go home and I ain't got sufficient clothes
I mean sufficient, talking about clothes
Well, I wanna go home, but I ain't got sufficient clothes

I bet my money and I lost it, Lord, it's so
Doggone my bad luck soul
Mmm, lost it, ain't it so?
I mean lost it, speakin' about so, now
I'll never bet on the deuce-trey-queen no more

Mama, I can't gamble, son, why don't you quit tryin'?
Doggone my bad luck soul
Mmm, why don't you quit tryin'?
Why don't you quit, I mean tryin'?
That joker stole off with that long-haired brown of mine

Sugar, you catch the Katy, I'll catch that Santa Fe
Doggone my bad luck soul
Sugar, you catch that Katy and I'll catch that Santa Fe
I mean the Santy, speakin' about Fe
When you get in Denver, pretty mama, look around for me

The woman I love's 'bout five feet from the ground
Doggone my bad luck soul
Hey, five feet from the ground
Five feet from the, I mean ground
She's a tailor-made woman, she ain't no hand-me-down

I ain't seen my sugar in three long weeks today
Doggone my bad luck soul
I ain't seen my sugar, three long weeks today
Three long weeks to, I mean day, girl
It's been so long, seems like my heart's gonn' break

I'm gonna run 'cross town, catch that southbound Santa Fe
Doggone my bad luck soul
Mmm, Lord, that Santa Fe
I mean the Santy, speakin' about Fe
Be on my way to what they call lovin' Tennessee

And they travel your veins
Now they live in your head
And they travel your veins
Every word that you speak
Is a word they have made

When you open your mouth
You’re too stupid to scream
When you open your mouth
You’re too stupid to scream
Your eyes are the holes
Where you suck in your need

[Verse 3]
There's steel in the air
And there’s blood on the wheels
There's steel in the air
And there’s blood on the wheels
But there’s nothing to fear
Because nothing here's real

[Verse 4]
Hear the dogs, now they howl
As the street fills with flood
Yeah the dogs now they howl
As the streets fills with flood
As your body drifts by
And your lungs fill with mud

[Verse 5]
There’s some people on earth
And they scrape in the dust
There’s some people on earth
Where they scrape in the dust
If you kill them enough
They will look just like us

[Verse 6]
Now tear down this wall
Let the animals out
Yeah tear down this wall
Let the criminals out
Let them take their revenge
Let their hate fill your mouth

Is just how it will be
And just as it was
Is just how it will be
For the promise of water
I walk on my knees

And I scream
At my brother’s sky

In my brother’s land
Murder
All across this land
The power’s in my brother’s hand
Your power’s where my brother stands

There were trains
And we out-run 'em
There were songs
And we out-sung 'em
There were brighter days never ending
There was time
And we were burnin'
There were rhymes
And we were learnin'
There was all the love two hearts could hold

And after all this time
You're always on my mind
Hey I could never let it end
'Cause my heart takes so long to mend
The dream that keeps your hopes alive
The lonely nights you hold inside
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still want you

There was rain
That we outlasted
There was pain
But we got past it
There were last goodbyes still left unspoken
There were ways I should have thrilled you
There were days I could have killed you
You're the only love my life has known

And after all this time
You're always on my mind
Hey I could never let you go
A broken heart that heals so slow
Could never beat for someone new
While you're alive and I am too
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still miss you

And I could never let it in
'Cause my heart takes so long to mend
The dream that keeps your hopes alive
The lonely nights you hold inside
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still want you
Hey after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still love you

[Verse 1]
Step into the light
Because your face is darkened
From the night
Will focus my attention
On the things more important than me and my life

[Chorus 1]
These days will change
Like memories fade into yesterday

[Verse 2]
In the heart of every moment
Lies a truth and a message, I might not know
Can't forget the time we shared
The lessons learned in the past I'll forever hold

[Chorus 2]
These days will change
Like memories fade
Into yesterday
And when I go
What will I know
And what will they say

[Bridge]
I fade to sleep, and I dream
Secrets I keep, with everything
It seems if I believe it
I might see you

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
(My dream is gone)
We fade to sleep and in our dreams
(My dream is gone)
Answers we seek to anything
(My dream is gone)
Awake only to see that
(My dream is gone)
My dream is gone

Open up your window
Show me where you are
The light inside your house keeps everybody out
But there must be a reason for the way you are
The rabbit bit the cord
And everyone ignored him
Teenagers know that they're going crazy
They run from stage to stage to stage
Their broken bones are just another part of the play
Clenched jaw and always raw frustration
Subject to change and change and change
My heart, for now, is just another part of where you could stay
Hurt house with all the windows open
See out through layers of soft mistakes
My flash on you is just another part of the play

I called my dealer, but he ain't dealin
A solid soul can be revealing
His set up is on his by-car
Its on fire
Once more for reverb
Received in gold
What kind of song
Could be in my head?
To sell us
We burn this icon
Its on fire
And we can't see where it came from
The choice ive made can't be undone
The only train weve seen won't go
Im losing sleep for bein slow
(waaa)
Inside the city inseams
Republic of the Lachine dont matter
Course you dont matter
Despite the tremors with we
Our love in blackest country be brighter
Dearest you flatter me
Be doobie brothers were wild
When they wrote
""Minute By Minute""
ZWY-ON ZWY-ON BE DIBBIE DEE AH
DIP DIP DIP DIP DIP DIP ZWY=ON
So dont you worry bout a thang
The wings i grew are sheltering
The nights we lay together in
This city needs us we need them

We are all cobras again, lean on lean in, via la ponce
We are all cobras again, leon lien, feel the pulse

Midnite cobras, comin again, oo-ooh ahhh. ohhhh ay-oh

2nd half of the song

(and you know that midnite upsets me, and you know that midnight upsets me)

Abstract fossil faxing rays, bag those apples bummer daze, nasa launches is a phase, small friends make waves

[Verse 1]
It's been so long since I've been good outside
I've been outside
I used to live outside
Static cruisin' white people don't die
Is reading cool, is readin' cool
I got books, brews
I got bikes, psych
Wind's a chillin', is it dealin'

[Refrain]
Wind's a chillin', is it dealin'
It's been so long since I've been good outside

[Verse 2]
Our summer jams have begun to get legendary to know, famous to-go
Ascetic monks of music
Brahmin pop was endo-supplied, girlfriend-denied
Launches, nighttime in Andy Summers
If Andy Summers drove you back into me, I'm thankful too
My bed got huge without you
Nighttime launches, Andy Summers
Launches with Andy Summers

[Refrain]
Nighttime launches, Andy Summers
Launches with Andy Summers

Dad's strut
We dazzle Florida's past
Go strut
Have-not-Jose, ask not
Or else Gladden change your name to global karma

I whisper the tongue - like an old friend
I cherish my time, here - alone
I wait in the eyes of the passing night
To help me laugh brushfires again
By the swallow's sleeve, I'm a new hand
Cutting out the shapes that burn me
I can touch the mouths of these child gods
And these true minds that hurt man

And the will - will go up
To the crashing sails
And the crushing wails
Of my old pen
This wind screams - while I'm asleep
And dreams that these white eyes
Will smile again

And the will - will go up
To the crashing sails
And the crushing wails
Of my old pen
This wind screams - while i'm asleep
And dreams that these white eyes
Will smile again

I take to the road like an old man
I cherish my time here - alone
I process the lines of the passing lights
Losing myself, I change my plans

By the western walls- I'm a cursed hand
By the eastern seas - I'm hardly wrong
I can swing myself down from these trees
When I  crave a glimpse of weary sands

I whisper the tongue like an old friend
I cherish my time here alone
I swing myself down from these trees
To help me laugh brushfires again

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I don't wanna know my face
I don't wanna know my name
I'll just follow you
And I'll find everything you do

I don't want to go back home
I don't want to be my own
But if you ran away
I'd be beside you all the way

[Chorus 2x]
Take me away
Take me away
I follow you

I don't want to go back home
I don't want to be my own
But if you ran away
I'd be behind you all the way

And I don't  want to see my mom
And I don't  want to see my dad
I just wanna see your face
That would make me so happy
Be so glad

Take me away
I'll follow you
I'll follow you anywhere

Take me away
Take me away
I'll follow you
I'll follow you anywhere

Take me away
Take me away
I'll follow you
C'mon baby
I'll follow you anywhere

Take me away
Take me away
I'll follow you
I'll follow you anywhere

Standing on a beach somewhere
Looking for something to see
As the beach rolls in, I swear
It's bringing something to me

Maybe one day I'll have what I want
Someone to stand next to me
Until then I'll just wait and watch
As the foam rolls in--to me

Beach foam baby, be my baby
Beach foam
Beach foam baby, be my baby, be mine

Standing on a shore somewhere, looking for something to be
As the beach rolls in, I swear, it's bringing something to me

Maybe one day I'll have what I want
Maybe one day I'll follow the streams
Until then I'll just wait and watch
As the foam rolls in--to me

Beach foam baby, be my baby
Beach foam
Beach foam baby, be my baby, be mine

Beach foam baby, be my baby
Beach foam
Beach foam baby, be my baby, be mine...

"
17589,"

From a hole in the floor - to a fountain of youth
You stepped to the door - all your hair in your hands
Wet through the shoes, and the calendar spun
On the porch - by the moon
Your words trailing off like a fading balloon

Today, you became real
In the quiet light, you stayed
And the child you found, you changed
With your head in your hands, you sang

You sang in the deep blues by the window pane
With the whole world crashing into your skull
You found the darkest place to lay your weary head
And share your secret soul

And you sang Oooh...

"
17590,"

You walk to the park as the setting sun
And sit as a stone til the day is done
You build us a house from sticks and shrubs
And huddle inside til I come home
There's a saying where I come from
No mistake is truly wrong
As the hole in my heart is where you fit
Your casual limbs inside my ribs

That's what we call life
For the first time i can feel tonight
That's how we fall light
That's why we share life
For the happiness of being twice
Half of a flawed kite

Come and catch me
I'm razor-like in half-sleep
Try and find me
I'm deep in the shallows
You can save me from the throes
Of winter nights in summer clothes
You can have my life, my rose
For feathers and hallways

And you teach me still
And you hold me dear
You unleash my will
And you always find me here

And the yoke weighed heavily
Upon the neck
And the tractors placed their tracks
Upon the cowering soil

The arrow cast
The bow pulled back
The arrow cast

And the chains were linked to other chains
Forged obliquely, freeing no one and everyone

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

From river to sea
The waves sing and shine
Untrained, unrestrained
Desiring nothing
From hill to vale
Form gives way to form

Standing there with dark in here
A crystal look, a crystal stare
Free release a soft affair
A free release a soft affair

An easy
Tonight

And do I want to get to her?
And do I want to know the name?
And should I fall inside of her?
Which one of us will pull the shade
Not easy
To see

And I think I'm in need of a free release
I'm missing black line from the needle please
I sense a green knife off the mezzanine
A V2 missile leaves my city clean

Come into our world
We can show you what we're made of
Come into our world
We can show you what we're made of

The satellites, they rise and fall
Sometimes she calls you on the phone
Our sanity, it lies so cold
Oh, Lord, I need someone to hold
Sad city lights, they flow full on
Against the harbor o r the shore
Our sanity, it lies so cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
We hope for directions, an entry, a call
This family it's frozen, the family's at halt
The song plays on and on
A soft situation for easing the pain
A room with a view a time off from the stake
The rain goes on and on and on
It could be so simple without you on board
You choose destinations you harm and you harm
Disarm, disarm, disarm
The satellites, they rise and fall
Sometimes she calls you on the phone
Our sanity, it lies so cold
Oh, Lord, I need someone to hold
Scary noise fills your home with harm
Our laws they keep us all alone
Oh, Lord, I need someone to hold
Oh, Lord, I need someone to hold
Held up by the numbers held up by designs
The limits put on us again and again
This song plays on and on
The flipside is coming the moment away
The flipside is coming the fortune the fame
The tease goes on the tease goes on
A soft situation for easing the wait
A room with a view a time off from the rain
This rhyme goes on and on and on
Desire it drives me the start of the day
Desire it drives me right down in the grave
Disarm, disarm, disarm

Won't you give us something to say?
Won't you help us cut across sea lines?
Won't you come and show us a face?
Can't you get us out in the meantime?

There's a party over there
This slack of a [?]
This lack of city space

[Verse 2]
You see me walking out of the room
Moving to another place
I'm left paralyzed
I'm flirting

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
We'll be lying out on the faults
And we're counting on you to pass time
Won't you give us something to say?
Can't you help us out along mean lines?

Forever and ever
The 60's, to sunshine, and movies are heaven
You won't ever find 'em here
They're only in our dreams

Shot down shot down
So violent

"
17833,"

[Verse 1]
Did you ever try to recreate
Past events all caught up in your head
Copies can be such an empty fix
Dreams left on an infinite repeat
Can't believe I'm sitting next to you
Outside trains, they keep on passing by
See the sunlight captured in your hair
See the sunlight captured on your neck

[Chorus]
Your faces circle in my head
It reflates every day
Like waves do
Like waves do
If I could wipe you from my mind
I'd do it straightaway
Like waves do
Like waves do

[Verse 2]
Did you ever stop to think
Figure out how certain systems work
Copies can be such an empty fix
Dreams left on an infinite repeat
Can't believe I'm sitting next to you
Outside, trains, they keep on passing by
See the sunlight captured in your hair
See the sunlight captured on your neck

[Chorus]
Your faces circle in my head
It reflates every day
Like waves do
Like waves do
If I could wipe you from my mind
I'd do it straightaway
Like waves do
Like waves do

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
I'm running headlong into night
Just to wipe you from my mind
Like waves do
So help me to
Your face is so clear in my head
It reflates every day
Like waves do
Like waves do

You stay dumb
Won't you save it on my heart
You say that i'm negative
But you know it's all made up
You know that a song is a sign
Let it be soft
Thank God that i find
To think at all

You know that I, I lie
You know that I, I lie
With high girls in motion
They're light
And they're bright
Eager in my den

When you leave it just unreal does
When you give it sweetly
Keep my king young
And you spill it from your tongue
We would all like the lake of love
But we really want to jump
Oh deep in the lower mind love
I could use you when I'm done
I don't need to listen
I don't need to listen
I don't need to listen
To a beast under the sun

Are you are you, here with me upon this misty mountain?
Gold is dripping from your hair as pearls fall in a fountain
Truth is streaming from your eyes, silver strands of smiles
Are you are you, here with me and did you count the miles?

Will you, will you, stay with me upon this heaven's bed?
All that you may ask of me need never to be said
Love dances through my heart and weaves its way to find
If you will, if you will, stay with me

With my love and with my mind

Encircled by the love we made
And I have slept inside the shade
Encircled by the love we made

And I have kissed the face of dreams

And I have ridden on the glow
That warms the sky with a rainbow

And I have waded in its golden streams
And I have waded in its golden streams

Unchecked growth climbing up the walls
Clear and calculating, mathematically-involved individuals resolve that:

“When the Cold Front hits, all you people better hit the deck
When the Cold Front hits, you better hide or you're gonna regret it.”

My husband lives inside a hole
My brother reads the Bible
He shakes the walls and threatens us all that:

“When the Cold Front hits, all you people better hit the deck
When the Cold Front hits, you better hide or you're gonna regret it
When an angry God comes down, you're gonna totally get it
When the firestorm hits the town, you're gonna beg for death
You're gonna beg for death.”

Dig too deep, get hot, hot hell, get devils inside your body
Climb too high, get wet, wet wings, get heaven inside your throat

And when the city starts to shatter. When the military comes. When the soldiers from their bases do arrive: we're going to feel the earth shake

Do you have any more money? Do you have any more food? Do you even have a roof over your head? Looks as though the end is coming soon

We came across a pharmacy
With its windows busted out
Pushed on through the broken glass
And had ourselves a look around
The medicines, the medicines
That esculent macabre for the mouth

We quickly filled our pockets
With pills of every kind
All sortsa shit like aspirin
That soon colonized our minds
And then we died
And then we died

But our rotting corpses lying there
Soon began to leak
And grow these lesions that all smelled
Just like a rose
And all the blood and guts inside us
Germinated into timeless pages
Stained with lines of lovely prose

I have been making presentations for a final escalation, I have been praying to the god of giving up
She says, “Lock the door behind you now, before the criminals/cops break in your house”
Oh, I have looked so hard for a place where I could die. But the winners up there of high-end living won't allow the broken insane to arise

So fuck this city. Fuck this job. They break you down before you even reach the top
In a god-fearing land, there ain't no lodging for the mad;
You can't get high enough to breathe before you drown

I'm gonna go back to that factory, where they make moving parts
That will take you very far away
In the flash of a pack of matches, I will be gone

"
18622,"

Piles and piles
Of old magazines
Windows locked up and hidden from the street
In a crawlspace, forgotten money
People tensing and waiting to come back home
You can feel the tension in the house
The moment you walk through the door
Sudden madness allow me in again

When the first train flies past the house, miles away
The screaming starts and it feels like minefield
Neighbors silently hiding in the shadows
There's a person locked in, behind that door -
Don't let anybody catch you turning the handle
It's a long, long night. It's going to be an awful and lonely night

Well... you can blot out the years and abandon the jungle
Cover up the tapes and refuse to look back
But your own right hand is not gonna save your soul
You have been followed! Ah, the mechanics
All the reactions that seem to attach themselves
It's been a very very very long year and it's gonna be an even longer night

And then a screen door slams; the windows break
A woman just jumps and scrapes at the hood of a car
When the car backs up into a streetlight, all of the neighbors call the cops
She falls off and the car speeds away
Headed for the border of a far away state
It's gonna mean an hour of freedom with the radio and quarter-filled gas tank
And a quarter filled gas tank
With the high beams on
And the windows down...

You've no way of knowing
There's no way of showing
What you mean to me Sonny Boy

You make them blue Sonny Boy
Friends may foresake me
Let them all foresake me
I still have you Sonny Boy

You're sent from heaven
And I know your worth
You made a heaven
For me here on earth

When I'm old and grey dear
Promise you won't stray dear

Promise you'll be good from day to day
Do as Mother says and never sin
Be the man your Daddy might have been
Your Daddy didn't have an easy start
So this is the wish that's in my heart

What I couldn't be, Little Pal
I want you to be, Little Pal
I want you to laugh and to sing and to play
And be good to Mother while Daddy's away

That you'll turn out right, Little Pal
So till we meet again
Heaven knows where or when
Pray for me now and then, Little Pal

When you start to roam;
The birds are singin', the day that you stray
But later, when you are further away
Things won't seem so lovely
When you're all alone;

When you're far from home:

Sorry that I made you wait

For one of your smiles
My Mammy! Oh oh oh...

Is it a masochist that makes a fool of me?
Am I wanting you or haunting me oh please

And the way you talk it makes me know I adore
Hold on tight, love me love me love me love me more
And the way you move it makes me know I'm so sure
And the way you talk it makes me know I adore
Hold on tight, make me make me make me make me sure
I’m scared I can't escape
Tied to what I want and what I think is fate
One thing, I can be sure
Keep giving me that feeling

Everything that fusses
Keeps giving me a reason
To believe in and to speak up
The way your fingers play on
While time just seems to wait on
Keeps giving me the feeling
That I know we must be near now
If you feel you’ve got it
Then you better flaunt it
If you want to own it
Then I guess we’d better haunt it
Say it if you mean it
But love it when you leave it
Put your hands together and
We move down to the C now

Move up to the beat oh
Laugh and kick your feet up
Say it if you mean it
Love it when you leave it
Stick my hands into the class
And know it
Where they shine and flicker fast
And show it
All that’s left that’s in your heart
Don’t fake it

We made ’em

And baby there’s no more shame for you

I'm in paradise
Yes it's very nice
Got my sex wrapped around my throat
Like a golden snake

Come over here and hey won't you
Throw me on the floor
Luck, it isn’t all we've got
I’m spinning like a top
When you touch me I want more

I found my love in Avalon
Beside the bay
I left my love in Avalon
And I sailed away
I dream of her in Avalon
From dusk till dawn
So I think I'll travel on
To Avalon

Every morn' my memories stray
Across the sea where flying fishes play
And as the night is falling
I find that I'm recalling
That blissful all-enthralling day

Beside the bay
And I sailed away
I dream of her in Avalon
From dusk till dawn
So I think I'll travel on

By a stiff breeze, a hellhound or a full moon

A vagabond with strong arms said:
""I will do you no harm""

We fit together, together like two birds in a little nest
Two tired birds who flew 'cross the desert in one long stretch
Oh, two lonesome doves, come now and take you a good rest
Now our feathers fall, our feathers fall together

Now I've returned from the airless expanse
Of the stratosphere, stratosphere, stratosphere
After all that slaughter, dear
We've nothing left to fear
After all that slaughter, dear
We've nothing left to fear
Oh, hellhound: lay down
We've nothing left to fear

We fit together, together like two birds in a little nest
And now our feathers fall, our feathers fall together

Who would have guessed?
Your hand-rolled cigarette lit by a burning stick
A burning stick, a burning stick
Oh strange as it may seem, I've seen it before in a dream
Oh strange as it may seem, I've seen it before in a dream
Oh, hellhound: lay down
You ain't as bad as you seem

Wake up, wake up my little dark eyes!
Break the spell, come into the light
Demons got you in your sleep
Feeding you lies

And ""here I am, beside you, dear""
He said through eyes of blue
""but we've yet to cross the vastest desert
So let's rise now, while the air is cool""

""the desert?"" I said, through eyes of brown
""must we go? I'm a-diggin' this dawn!
You see I've crossed them all, no matter how big or small
Now I want to lay my bindle down""

""woman"", he said, ""just look at those legs
Your limbs are long and strong
You've had adequate rest, now take this here test
And we'll see if you're all right or all wrong
You've had adequate rest, now take this here test
And we'll see if you're all right or all wrong!""

""I don't know about no test...
Not now when I'm open to my loamy depths!
Old air blowin' out the cracks
And that last test nearly broke my back.""

Hey! I'm afraid this man is all wrong
I'm afraid this man is alright
What now to do, but stay up all night
Chasing ghosts that fade in the light?
What now to do, but stay up all night
Chasing words that fade in the light?

They're talking behind my back
Thinkin' like a pack
Takin' down the weak
Straggler in the back
Oh, baby don't
Let them talk you out of me

Single out the singleton
Rollin' on your own again
Weak flesh is sick flesh
Oh, no, no please don't
Let them talk you out of me

I thought I'd found a home
In an awful dream
The master said I had to leave
I could not scream
Though I tried, I tried I tried

"
18722,
18723,"

This love's not dead
It's walking through walls
Floating through halls
And turning away when it's name is called

No more a mystery
Than a spider web or a tangled ball of twine:
Just cut out the knots, and start with a fresh line

Weave your magic web
From now until the end
You'll get the angle right
There's not another soul in sight
So scream your secrets
Up to the full-star sky
Scream secrets below the moon
Your time is coming soon
Yeah soon your time will come

Now I know your'e light
Because you're leaving
And leaving's the one thing
That brings release from the
Dull ache and the demon's wake

No more a mystery than a
Spider web or a tangled ball of twine:
Just cut out the knots, and start with a fresh line

I don't want that kind of love
I don't want to cage the dove
Count the days until your gone, but:
Oh how you'll miss my song

Miss it more than you know how

I had a big surprise today while in a ten cent photo play, I
Really saw my old home town way down in Dixieland It was
Simply grand, just to sit right there, and gaze on the scenes
Of bygone days, made me yearn to return to the land and people
I will love always, I even saw the same old school, where I learned the golden rule

I'd like to meet the movie man, I want to shake him by the hand, I
Want to tell him that he wrote a grand scenario, he knew where to
Go, plain as day upon the screen, Hezakiah can be seen, Little Mose
On his toes, looking at the camera, nearly spoiled the scene, I saw
The cotton white as foam, I saw my home sweet home

Down where the Swanee River flows I want to be there Down where
The cotton blossom grows, I want to see there, my little sister Flo'
Keepin' time with Uncle Joe, singing a song and raggin' on his
Old banjo I see my dear old Mother Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, how I
Love her, when the birds are singing in the wildwood My happy
Childhood comes back once more my heart is sore, that's why I'm
Going back where they care for me Every night they say a little prayer
For me down where the Swanee River flows

The bird, oh he go lightly
But sometimes, a bird get lonely
Oh, the birdie, does the birdie
Birdie need some company?

I know you got a big cock
'cause your girlfriend's got a big mouth
And I hear you'll be headed down south
By way of the High Desert Flyway

And I'll fly with you for a while, old friend
And know that this is no end
But a lifetime of, ""hello again, again""

Hello again, hello again, my friend
Low again, low again, old friend

I know you could do better
If you and I were together
But I ain't no homewrecker
No, I ain't gonna wreck no home
When I'm tryin' to build my own

Yes, everybody needs a home, a home
And someday, I'll have you in mine
""maybe tomorrow, honey, someplace down the line.""

So fly with me for a while, old friend
And know that this is no end
But a lifetime of, ""hello again, again""

Hello again, hello again my friend
Low again, low again, old friend
Dear friend

The bird, oh he go lightly
But sometimes, a bird get lonely
Oh the birdie, does the birdie
Birdie need some company?

The chain is heavy, heavier, heaviest
Cold as steel
Blue and so not real
In a very slow move she picks it up, she kick me up
And then rattles rattles rattles rattles

She's got a hold on me
Not in a tasty way
She's got a hold on me
In a nasty way

Every person in me says ""no no no""
But there is no other solution to this
Every person in me says ""run, now go
Before she will seal it
With a snake's kiss""

The bowl is full of sugar, oh yeah
The car is full of smoke, oh no
The lemonade is too sour
In this twilight hour
The geminis got separated, oh why?
It was her fault, she did it
Just like she cut this big hole in my chest
How am I ever gonna get some rest?

She's got a hold on me
Not in a tasty way
She's got a hold on me
In a nasty way

She picks it up, she kick me up
She picks it up, she kick me up
And then rattles, rattles, rattles, rattles
Rattles, rattles, rattles, rattles

What makes this place different from all the places we have?
I smell the reborn earth in the noisy air
A special kind of one and something's going to fall

Who am I to make a crowd out of moving people?
I don't look like the rest and they don't look like each other
We are all dead fishes in a bowl
We are just so easy to laugh at
What makes this place sound so true
And fight like a red bull?
Knee high boots and a sharp umbrella
Somethings gonna fall

Someone's going to lose something
Someone's going to lose someone
Something's going to happen that we
Never could have guessed from the start

So how can a secret be a lie?
How can a lie look like the truth?
How can that truth just be a shadow?
A shadow to the secret?

A safe pair of hands
A reason to stand
Some guns to stick to
Rational demands

Come on now ladies
They won't fertilise themselves
Get into the ball game
Let's clear those shelves

That's what I read in that Sunday magazine
The anvil is falling, falling on your head
You're just picking your knickers from your arse
Like you're playing a one stringed harp
Like you're playing a one stringed harp

Like Wily Coyote
As if the fall wasn't enough
Those bastards from Acme
They got more nasty stuff

Salt in my wounds
Sticking in the boot
We're all bulimic
But keep forgetting to puke

That's what I read in that Sunday magazine
The anvil is falling, falling on your head
You're just picking your knickers from your arse
Like you're playing a one stringed harp
Like you're playing a one stringed harp

Chalk it up, and write it down

The hand of history
Is clawing at my back
The Iron Fist of she
Cuping at my sack

Grip is tightening
My voice is heightening
This orange alert
Is beginning to crack

That's what I read in that Sunday magazine
The anvil is falling, falling on your head
You're just picking your knickers from your arse
Like you're playing a one stringed harp
Like you're playing a one stringed harp

Chalk it up, and write it down

I am the defector
And you’re the farmer’s daughter
You been teasing us farm boys
Till we start talkin’ about those rabbits, George
Oh won’t you tell us ‘bout those rabbits, George?

I am the defector
I give it what it need
Let’s make a new world order
Let’s make it rhyme

You’re the chocolate at the end of my Cornetto
I love the way your underwire bra
Always sets off that X-ray machine

Comin’ into land and
Now I love the colour of it all
Blue lights on the runway
I love the colour of it all

I am the defector
‘Cause someone stirred my soul
With that great big stick of hers
Kinda looks like an oar
The accountants have taken the movie
Yeah, they’re on set
The people from the mobile phone company
Say who gets to play and who gets to not

You’re a picture of the check out girl
Hand me a plastic bag
I got the sweats trying to open it
As it all piles up, I wish I didn’t bite my nails

Comin’ into land and
Now I love the colour of it all
Blue lights on the runway
I love the colour of it all
Getting ready to spill my guts and
I love the colour of it all
To the waitress on roller skates
I love the colour of it all
Oh the colour of it all

I am the great defector
So I must affect an air
Of a man who’s maybe seen too much
But still just manages to care

Still you’re the chocolate at the end of my Cornetto
I love the way your underwire bra
Always sets off that Xray machine

Comin’ into land and
Now I love the colour of it all
Blue lights on the runway
I love the colour of it all
Getting ready to spill my guts and
I love the colour of it all
To the, to the waitress on roller skates
I love the colour of it all
Oh the colour of it all
Waitress on roller skates
Waitress on roller skates (Love the colour of it all)
Waitress on roller skates
Waitress on roller skates
Waitress on roller skates
Waitress on roller skates (Love the colour of it all)
Waitress on roller skates
Love the colour of it all
Love the colour of it all

You Cannot See With Them Eyes
A Tired Hand, Her Naked Hand, Putting Me To Sleep

Has Left Me Dry And My Abstinence Has Been
Postponed By My Comfort In Denial
And The Worst Lie It May Be That Hope Said
She'd Be The Last One To Leave
Always Close Now Sense It Clear
For Years To Come I Can't Go Back
To The Things I Held So...I Held So Dear
We Were Crushed By Her Halo Oh What A Way To Go...
Endlessly She Said Forevermore In Debt
Colourful, So Beautiful, With Fever Eyes Closed And So Free
Those Were My Heroines
Freedom Roar From Senseless Mind

Pure as the unborn son, pure as the maid should be
Ceased to breathe again
Never look away
From those with nothing to spare

But I do and I don't want to care anymore
If I close my eyes would it spare me the sight?
Of decay, corruption, how we nurture destruction
And everything that will doom us all

Chaos may be thy name, you left us for anything
Trust never been so misplaced
As in your arms that day those that you gave away
To those who could ease your mind
We were nothing but a waste of your time and space

But I do and I don't want to care anymore
If I close my eyes would it spare me the sight?
Of decay, corruption, how we nurture destruction
And everything that will doom us all

You Cannot See With Them Eyes
A Tired Hand, Her Naked Hand, Putting Me To Sleep
It Won't Be Long, Your Glow
Has Left Me Dry And My Abstinence Has Been
Postponed By My Comfort In Denial
And The Worst Lie It May Be That Hope Said
She'd Be The Last One To Leave
Always Close Now Sense It Clear
For Years To Come I Can't Go Back
To The Things I Held So...I Held So Dear
We Were Crushed By Her Halo Oh What A Way To Go...
Endlessly She Said Forevermore In Debt
Colourful, So Beautiful, With Fever Eyes Closed And So Free
Those Were My Heroines
Freedom Roar From Senseless Mind
Apocalypse All Dressed In White
Saw It Coming Watched Them Leaving With All I Ever Was

Since Peace Of Mind Was Not Meant For Me

Disengage the cold world
Russia, Czech Republic

I remember punk

Came at me with white light
I can still remember the smell
Never washed his clothes
Something about the stained glass window

So wake me when you see life's worth living out
And tell me when this gets better
But don't be alarmed if I'm not here when you figure it out just call
I'll throw you a line
Take in this world you've broken down
Your hero's gone and there's no one left in town
Just one more page here left to write
But where do you go when the curtain's coming down
How did we ever get this far
There's something better for both these lives on the outsideand we're on our way
To the lives we said we would play
And we're on our way
To the roads we knew we would take

My greatest fear I fantasized
The days were long, the weeks flew by
Before I knew I was awake
My days were through, it was too late

My greatest fear I organized
Into something more realized
And now what's left I get to spend
Knowing that it's about to end

My greatest fear I can't decode
A cryptogram whose seeds weren't sewn
My last few months I arose out
My vision blurred, there was no sound

There was no sound, there was no sound

To try and risk a pace

The car ride home was blinded again

Words lost their meaning and could not explain
Why the subject was always just out of frame

I lived on Hazel Street
Protect me from the scene
And guide me with your heat

Mary had a pretty symphony
Spoken words on gracious melody
What she sang is always in my head
But I couldn't sing it to you
Now she's sleeping many steps away
With every song of hate and love in mind
Something that I'd love to hear again
But maybe she will never come back

My spark is dead
Inside of my head, there's nothing
Only noise instead of music
Won't you pull my strings once again?

Mary was my muse and I miss her
I can't do anything by myself

All the music vanished and lost

Piece of hair of scratches of her skin
Maybe I will find her on the way
Or maybe she will never come back

Tell me which is the best way to heal
There's a dead end in all directions
Get yourself away, i'm just having a bad day

This is one more reason why i wish i never met you on my way
Come in but turn off the light, i don't wanna show you this part of me

This is something i don't wanna deal with
But the bad seed grows in my head
I just want you to forget a bout me
Get youself away, i'm just having a bad day

This is one more reason why i wish i never met you on my way
Come in but turn off the light, i don't wanna show you this part of me

Turning pain into something beautiful
Is the best way i've ever found
You can touch, but you'll have to close your eyes
Get yourself away, i'm just having a bad day

This is one more reason why i wish i never met you on my way
Come in but turn off the light, i don't wanna show you this part of me

O sail of skin tumbling in the air
Blowing anywhere

O absent law
Chattering useless teeth
Secreting quiet sweat

Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium

O mirror that does not reflect

O fire that illuminates nothing
But itself

O shadow of what never was
But seems to have been
And to have been lost

Mysterium
Mysterium

And the yoke weighed heavily
Upon the neck
And the tractors placed their tracks
Upon the cowering soil

The arrow cast
The bow pulled back
The arrow cast

And the chains were linked to other chains
Forged obliquely, freeing no one and everyone

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

From river to sea
The waves sing and shine
Untrained, unrestrained
Desiring nothing
From hill to vale
Form gives way to form

"
19792,

The steam shall give birth to a glacier
The heath shall give way to sand
Bone shall become tusk
Hair shall become nail
Tooth shall cling to skull

Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire

Asphault shall flow like water
Forest shall crowd out the worms

Nothing ever began
There was no dawn
The heat chars
The cold stabs

The wheat shall give way to chaff
Bone shall crack against bone

Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire

I claw through veil after veil

Absent purity

Resounding though the arcangel
Like marrow

The future is nowhere
The past is gone

Do you remember the time
We drove out to lousiana?
To my father's beach house? I got us so lost
I knew right then because you never got angry
When we reached the city
And there weren't any rooms left

So we slept outside under sulphur lights
In the drugstore parking lot
All the stars came out, it was getting cold
But inside, it was so hot. So hot...

It had been four years since the time
That I really knew you
When you suddenly called me, I was so happy
Cuz you were doing all the things
You said you would do
I couldn't believe it, that someone could be so true

When you looked the other way I made a film
About someone just like you
Said the things you said. Did the things you did
And I played myself
See we were really together all that time
All that time...

Do you remember the time
We drove out to lousiana?
To my father's beach house? I got us so lost
I knew right then I loved you
Cuz you never got angry
When we reached the city
And there weren't any rooms left
The streets were empty

Sunday night, by subway light
But the train is still far away
You said you'd come
By now everyone is drinking wine
From paper cups…
Are you lonesome tonight
Do you feel a little achy
I don't think you have a fever
But I don't know…you do seem cold
It's like black, black, black, black
Black cars you can't see into
Leaving you wondering
And waiting on the curb
With all their little secrets
So keep on running from the winter
But you can't help missing the snow
And all these unfamiliar people
Who can't ever go back home
Who can't ever go back home

"
20013,"

Come, come, come
We're all on the run
No one sleeps at night
The phones all ring
The sirens sing
The stars seem extra bright
And the buildings all light up like ornaments
In some black velvet painting over the bed

I want to grab you and tell you
Be happy we found someone to love
'Cuz out here it never seems to be enough
Yeah, out here it never seems to be enough
No it never never never never never never is enough

20014,"

Star light, blistering white, black water
A thousand motorbikes, black water
And housewives still on the run
From black water and
Killer spelling bees, black water

The boys are breaking guitars
In black water
And eating little girl hearts in
Black water

Kind of lovable but kind of
Carelessly cruel
Sort of unstoppable
But officially going nowhere
The colored lights leave you hypnotized
But you're frozen in the spotlight's glare
So never be the pretentious one
And never be the one who achieves

Just rock it straight from the crypt
Into black water
That's all it takes to be hip
In black water
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Wash away your mistakes
In black water

Let's go to the river
Let's go to the creek
Let's go down in the water
And cool off this hot week

Let's go down to the river
Let's go to the lake
Let's burn a fire and give this scene a break

Let's get out of the city
Let's go run in the street
Let's sit down in the holy water where the air is clear and clean

Maybe Seb and you can
Grab some firewood
And me and Vi will take car of the booze
And Hannah and Brad will be good company

Let's go to the river
Let's go to the lake
Let's drink some holy water and get ourselves
Erased

Let's go to the river
Let's go to the creek
Let's go down in the water and cool off this hot week

Grab the old guitar and your mama's blanket
And a book about serial killers that I can read
(read read read)
And don't forget to bring...

(oooooooo)

Let's stay in this spot and we're better off dead
(dead dead dead)

Let's go to the water and praise the gates
With a sheen
Let's go out to the country
Where the sky is blue and the grass is green
First i take my shoes off then i take my socks off
Doesn't even matter where rocks that we can jump off
Try and stop me nobody can stop me
Coconut juices tearing down my body
Let'd go to the gutter
Let's go to down in the train
Let's get the hell outta here before we drive ourselves insane
Let's go to the river
Let's go to the creek
Let's go down in the water to wash off this dirty week

Let's go to the water x2

A friend of mine went riding
To the car to a town
Bought a sandwich and a milkshake
Found a bench and sat down
Met some girlies and some fellas
And made a new life

It's such a simple story
It'll make you think twice

About the trying and the doin' that we do everyday
And the caring and the workin' and the minimum wage
That you're makin' at your job
And spending at the bar

It's just about leaving
You don't have to go very far

Cuz new york is a certain kind of sickness
And you've been ill
Since far before you moved here
But you can't get well
In a place that is proud of just how cold it can be
And of its brutality

Before my friend went riding i asked her if it was
A possibility that it is just us
Just the boyfriends, and the babies
Just the subways, the scene, and the scabies

Then she said that while she knows
That that might be the case
Sometimes you can enjoy the way our hands interlace
Sometimes things are too hard and every thing's dark
Sometimes we just got to blame new york

Cuz new york is a certain kind of sickness
And you've been ill
Since far before you moved here
But you can't get well
In a place that is proud of just how cold it can be
And of its brutality

I swear to god it's not me
It's New York
I swear to god it's not us
It's New York
I swear to god it's not me
It's New York
I swear to god it's not
It's New York
I swear to god it's not us
I swear to god it's not us
I swear to god it's not us

Jack Dunn, son of a gun, somewhere in France today
Keeps fit doing his bit, up to his eyes in clay
Each night after a fight to pass the time along
He's got a little gramophone that plays this song

[Chorus]
Take me back to dear old Blighty!
Put me on the train for London town
Take me over there
Drop me anywhere
Birmingham, Leeds, or Manchester, well, I don't care!
I should love to see my best girl
Cuddling up again we soon should be
(Whoa!)
Tiddley-iddley-ighty
Hurry me back to Blighty
Blighty is the place for me!

One day, Mickey O'Shea, out in a trench somewhere
So brave, having a shave, trying to part his hair
Mick yells, dodging the shells and lumps of dynamite:
""Talk of the Crystal Palace on a firework night!""

Sono chiuso nella coscienza della chiusura della coscienza in un solo corpo e della conseguente struttura asintotica della comprensione

Taccio per pochi secondi lasciandoti il tempo per mettere insieme i pezzi, puro autocompiacimento concettuale e se non lo consideriamo necessariamente un male magari ne apprezziamo i mezzi, c'è chi lo fa con l'auto nuova, chi con la nuova morosa se regge al test delle curve come un auto nuova, chi con il suo aspetto, come la morosa che sa ed accetta di essere solo un auto nuova, chi col ""chi col"" come me che aspetto, non ho la patente

La forma dei miei pezzi richiederà queste pause finché avrò la volontà di sfidare la tua capacità di comprensione, causa della velocità di ogni mia composizione la quale richiede un contachilometri come.. come cosa? dai che hai capito! Come forse hai capito che sono una persona insicura e che la quantità di promozione dei miei cd di cui ho bisogno è inversamente proporzionale alla mia indipendenza etica poiché non faccio sentire i miei cd per amore del prossimo ma per ricever conferme. Me le vuoi dare anche stavolta? Medita

Ora che mi sono smascherato temi che non ti possa piacere il resto del cd? Solo se il tuo fine è la suspense conoscere l'identità dell'assassino prima della visione rovina la degustazione di un film, inoltre non esiste smascheramento definitivo in quanto io cambio e ogni conoscenza esemplifica e più la mia vanità si limita rivelandosi in un autocritica più si amplifica. Il punto è che tu mi chiedi se è per me o per gli altri che scrivo ogni mia rima, ora so che in ogni caso il fine è comunque la mia autostima, quindi cosa cambia? Resto un birro, ma forse sto cadendo nel concetto di onestà e coerenza con il background che ha reso gli mc orgogliosi delle loro abitudini più grezze, mentre io sono giunto alla necessità di applicarlo al di là di una totale sincerità perché nessun mare in cui tutti posson nuotare è limpido e si sporca di gossip e perché se la musica in media esprime l'inesprimibile i miei testi esprimono l'esprimibile quindi i miei problemi più grossi restano dentro di me o comunque per me e per quelli che seleziono direttamente, ma quando comunicare serve solo a dare una forma per rielaborare linguisticamente posso anche ripetere a voce alta da solo, autonomamente

Se ti stai chiedendo cosa c'entra tutto questo col titolo sappi che è scelto volontariamente incoerente come ogni riflessione che non ha niente a che fare col tema iniziale ed è inserita in un pezzo per renderlo più lungo in modo che lo si ascolti solo quando si ha veramente voglia di ascoltare, sennò la comprensione viene male o non viene per niente, ma di sicuro fuori dal contesto musicale devo ancora imparare a parlare lentamente

Questa trovata delle pause non è granché originale, infatti crea solo suspense e un pretesto, tanto so che a molti resta solo il beat quando interrompo il testo o che chi vuole davvero comprendermi si crea autonomamente le sue pause dopo il pezzo o durante tramite l'omonimo tasto. Vuoi un break? Spezza con chi cazzo sarà interessato a 'sti miei viaggi? e perché non li espongo in modo più esteso e meticoloso tramite dei saggi? Forse perché i testi accademici a volte ci rendono dei pagliacci che fanno ridere proprio per la pretesa di scientificità; io almeno sono un pagliaccio e mi piaccio cosi e nel 2000 uno dei ruoli che somiglia più al buffone è l'mc. So che ogni teoria rivela soprattutto il motivo per il quale è stata creata come questa pagliacciata nata giocando con gli schemi che ipotizzo applicabili al mio operato, forse per una paura inconscia di essere giudicato come quando ho paura di non essere eccitante ma schivo lo specchio dell'autostima estetica che in un istante si sublima nell'autostima di un'etica danzante. Quindi il problema è nel rapporto col mio corpo che scordo cercando il centro dell'attenzione in ogni mio rapporto. Potrei elencarti diversi ipotetici traumi infantili che mi hanno formato in passato, come il ruolo di cantante principale che al concerto delle elementari mi è stato negato, o quello di protagonista nel teatrino dell'asilo, si lo posso considerare ma come ogni dato, ovvero immerso in un mare di cause casuali delle quali ho sondato solo minime percentuali, quindi ogni autoanalisi deforma necessariamente, mi tolgo maschere cercando il volto sottostante ma questa metafora pretende una verità coerente dove c'è solamente un contingente intreccio di pulsioni, posso solo crearmi una maschera coerente in un testo come questo ma essendo ingenuo ed onesto poi vorrò sentirmi all'altezza di quella maschera non solo nell'arte ma anche nel resto, quindi sono un commediante nell'arte e l'imitazione di quel commediante nella vita restante

Ho pezzi peripatetici: non aristotelici ma per - i - patetici

Forse la nascita del linguaggio va oltre la teoria gestuale ma l'uso dei gesti per me è affascinante, anche perché sono un linguaggio a sé stante, non sempre volontario. Un uomo che danza può comunicarci stati d'animo senza l'astrazione per la quale è necessario un vocabolario, mentre la gestualità come farcitura del linguaggio scompare quando l'astrazione aumenta, ma tutto questo non ti interessa poiché tu non vuoi esprimerti ma solo fare il figo con le bimbe, con le quali balli o parli in occasioni ben distinte, e se io le sovrapponessi? Se mi muovessi con gesti connessi a ciò che dico ma ognuno esaltato e appassionato come a teatro? Ma nella tua morale i comportamenti nuovi non sono permessi, hai paura di esser giudicato e ti convinci che gesticolare sia da rapper ovvero da fessi, allora dovresti anche dosare l'uso di ogni muscolo facciale
Dopo una pista di coca vai in pista: ""pistaaaaa arriva il tipo che poga"", che si sente giustificato a spingermi mentre seguo un concerto e mi da dell'effeminato per convincermi, no grazie: la tecnica del ""non hai le palle di"" mi ha sottomesso solo nell'adolescenza
A volte l' esibizione per voi è solo una masturbazione dell'autostima da performer, ma quando fate autoerotismo fisico cancellate le orme, per questo mi tocco in pubblico senza problemi, ma non faccio futili concerti, ho schemi opposti ai vostri, ballo ma non in pista
Ballo ma non in pista
Ballo ma non in pista
Ballo ma non in pista

Come dal sesso all'amore ogni tabù induce ad avere per il suo opposto idolatria, come i traumi totalitaristici sono i tabù che han sostituito al regno dei cieli la democrazia e la forza dell'istituzione liberamente ispirata a Cristo sta nell'aver sedotto troppo alla debolezza morale che conduce al buonismo ancor'oggi sfruttato dai politici per essere votati. Stato e Chiesa sono tutt'altro che separati, il progresso collettivo è ossessivo-compulsivo, più l'uomo cerca efficacia meno è sicuro, macchine onnipotenti e uomini decadenti se cerco di proiettarlo nel futuro, altro che Neo. Viviamo in un sistema maniaco-depressivo che deprime e/o rende iperattivo
Il bambino predisponendolo a deficit dell'attenzione a causa dei ritmi delle industrie o dell'integrazione nell'industria dell'educazione, se nessuno vuole fare figli non basta finanziare la procreazione, chi è povero farà figli per incassare ma poi li getterà nel bidone o in qualche istituto a sua volta finanziato in un'entropia dell'organizzazione. In ogni mia ricerca trovo una grave contraddizione perché il problema è alla radice mentre viene cercata sempre e soltanto in superficie una soluzione. L'uomo vuole esemplificare e la fretta attuale non fa che aumentare questa necessità in maniera esponenziale e come sempre io non ho solo ragione, considerando che la mia apologia della calma è a sua volta in contraddizione con la velocità di ogni mia canzone

Che cosa pensi quando ti dicono che usiamo solo una piccola percentuale delle potenzialità del nostro cervello? E non riporto dati precisi per non sopravvalutare l'autorità della scienza odierna, cosa che troppi fanno per necessità di una verità eterna. Io penso che non c'era bisogno della neurologia per accorgersene, e chi si crede in buona fede dotato di capacità superiori è spesso preda di sé stesso, e chi inventa test come il Laboratorio di Zetetica è un fesso e chi considera la parapsicologia noumenica non cerca la verità ma un compromesso. In ogni caso io preferisco cercare la patologia dietro ogni chiaroveggenza o misticismo, e so che chi utilizza poco il suo cervello sovente è un esempio sano di uomo e che se mi leggi la mano non vedi il mio futuro ma al massimo il passato, nel senso delle tracce che mi ha lasciato ciò che nelle ore precedenti ho toccato
Chiropazzia, parapsicologia, parepsicologia, parapsicologia, parepsicologia

Riassunto delle puntate precedenti: i notri eroi hanno compreso che in Italia per fare testi rap potenti bisogna farli dementi, come all'origine americana di questi movimenti quando gli mc erano solo accompagnamenti della vera scoperta che era l'ossessiva ripetizione dei momenti più eccitanti di brani di altri generi e io che cercavo l'essenza del rap nel significato del testo ora so che la rappata è nata dalla parlata degli speaker da discoteca che detesto e del resto nessun rapperz smette di scrivere con poco da trasmettere mentre io cerco la definizione per questa alienazione da ripetizione del campione e ancora molti non capiscono il compactdisc che non pompa in disco, oggi che l'mceeing diviene un assolo metrico, un puro sfoggio di tecnica che ribalto con un nuovo approccio estetico, se metà resto a maggese, metà esco con una metatesto per le teste più accese e il movimento del tuo collo a tempo si interrompe forse un ascolto più attento irrompe sopra sto scempio in cui assemblo ombre di Schonberg, onde evitare esaltazioni notate che non vi sono giudizi di valore sull'hip-hop in queste descrizioni, se li trovate vi serve farlo, quando è necessario so distinguere la simpatia dal rispetto, se tu incontrassi senza conoscerlo Berlusconi magari sareste amiconi. Al contrario, io rispetto i malati d'hiphop ma di sicuro non è stima e la mia simpatia è rivolta a chi innova sta musica chiusa come ogni disciplina. Questione di gusti

Il mio primo approccio con la sessualità fu molto simile a South Park: un Cartman della situazione forte della sua novità mi domandò se mi masturbavo e sborravo e io con quell'orgoglio infantile che rende mendace pur di non fare figuracce risposi: ""ma certo che sborro"", ma quando tornai a casa la mia vita mutò radicalmente. Per molti essere fidanzati è come costruire un cesso, ovvero sapere di avere un luogo accogliente nel quale svuotarsi abitudinariamente, oggi è comico e neanche immagino il tragico matrimonio imposto dal parente per un patrimonio opposto al sogno di una figlia impotente. La vita è una scatola di cioccolatini come per Forrest ma perché se la esponi al calore si scioglie e se torna allo stato solido lo fa con nuove forme, come nel dialogo sul massaggio ai piedi tra Jules e Vincent le persone sono scisse a causa di differenti delimitazioni delle concezioni di tradimenti. Molti si chiedono se è giusto toccarsi pensando a donne d'altri o uomini d'altre, pochi si chiedono se è giusto limitare le future esperienze del partner: se veramente volete che abbia il meglio siete troppo superbi identificandovi con esso, e forse chi reprime eccitazioni per partner di altri fa solo peggio. Masturbatevi e andate in pace, l'uomo ha un metodo in più per difendersi dall'incantesimo della Velina, la Circe odierna: infatti dopo la masturbazione l'uomo non sente più la seduzione, mentre molte donne continuano a sentire la competizione. Chiedo venia e mi danno Nuvenia, nauseato dai pregiudizi sulle donne e dalle donne che li confermano, questo... questo era il fine del femminismo?

Accontentarsi di uno o di due è troppo comodo. L'uomo, essere per natura poco autonomo, concentra la sua fede su un singolo elemento spesso perché sta cadendo e si aggrappa e raramente risale, idealizza l'appiglio come una meta e non come una tappa semplicemente poiché non aveva ammesso a se stesso il fatto che stava cadendo si tappa gli occhi. Solo quando è ben nutrito
Il suo complesso di inferiorità si fa accettazione e diversificazione dal mito barra nemico, per questo quando sono a digiuno di esperienze sento solo l'invidia e la pulsione all'imitazione, quindi il modo migliore di dare un senso a una tradizione è confutarla
Come la devozione a un maestro: ha in seme la migliore inimicizia ma se non sai imparare non puoi nemmeno affrontarla, ma è soprattutto la scuola odierna ad essere un errore ed è una delle cose che mi ha insegnato involontariamente ogni professore. Ora sono al mio crepuscolo degli idoli e non ho un modello che mi limita, la mia ricerca proprio ora si fa più serena e serendipica, mantengo l'iperattività che avevo fisicamente da adolescente e che per la stupida paura di essere stupido avevo trasmesso alla mente, ora ho connesso il mio stile più vecchio a quello più recente perché supero abitudini mixandole e non interrompendole bruscamente. Gli alcolisti dopo l'illuminazione da salutisti rischiano attacchi epilettici

Mentre l'eco delle critiche altrui amplificava i miei sensi di colpa e mi persuadeva che non smetterò di fare un errore solo perché non è la prima volta, io mi chiedevo qual'è il significato di una scusa, cosi l'ho chiesto a google ingenuamente poiché ovviamente la maggior parte dei siti che il motore di ricerca proponeva contenevano solo scuse pronte da inviare per sms e ho ripensato che ciò che molti vogliono è essere perdonati senza capirsi, per non sentirsi dei vermi, per paura di essere puniti in risse o inferni, perché quando una ragazza li lascia non sono più abituati a stare da soli, fermi, e non vedono la dignità di accettarlo strippando o arrivando a fingersi servi. Quando ho le forze riesco evitare di assegnare le colpe dopo un diverbio e sono certo che gli uomini cercano scorciatoie come copiare la scusa già pronta su internet, come la maggior parte delle potenzialità di internet, come la mia ricerca di un interpretazione morale preconfezionata causata da paranoie, come sto pezzo e ogni mia teoria sulle scorciatoie

Questo cd ha dei versi ma non ha un verso

Paura di essere visto durante l'autoerotismo come creazione del concetto di onnipresenza, vandalismo spicciolo di maggiorenni, istrionismo conseguenza della consapevolezza di essere ammirato, sfondo del desktop con paesaggi naturali solo per sentirsi meno alienato, la tipa che ho ospitato che non credeva nell'AIDS dicendo che esiste solo se lo temi, nel dubbio il bagno io dopo l'ho disinfettato, estremismo etico non giustificato da una minaccia estrema aka straight edge italiano, ragazza con misticismo come cosmetico: dare importanza a quello che gli altri pensano del tuo gusto estetico, selettività della scelta sessuale azzerata dall'abuso alcolico, non aprire il menù della contingenza e chiedere al cameriere ""il solito"", rifiuto sessuale farcito di scuse irreali che mascherano l'impronunciabile ""non mi ecciti"", citazione boriosa, onicofagia, scaccolarsi con l'odore di aglio o benzina sulle mani, prigioni, manicomi, CPT come discariche sociali, consigli musicali, critiche di anziani davanti ai cantieri, ossessione salutista senza limiti facilitata dall'invisibilità dei batteri, ritornelli pop che ti ritrovi a canticchiare durante faccende domestiche, rapporto a tre ""ma non con due uomini, solo se ci son due lesbiche eh"", odio per l'America incosciente dell'impero fondato sul guadagno oltre le nazioni, complimenti come velate autoaffermazioni, consigli oggettivi che non han le palle di farsi critiche soggettive, manifestazione politica del colpevole che ha trovato un capro espiatorio, insonnia volontaria, discussioni astratte proprio perché fatte con chi temo comprenda i punti di partenza concreti, uso di medicinali auto prescritti con dubbi causati dall'incomprensione del foglio illustrativo, invenzione delle cause di un male non riuscendo ad accettarlo privo di un motivo, concerto di clacson, interessarsi alla politica solo per la legalizzazione delle droghe, fretta mattutina che fa dimenticare i sogni, chi si suicida per paura di vivere, chi invece ha paura di vivere ma non si suicida e quindi ha una paura in più, troppe per i miei gusti! Che palle le lamentele come questa!

I've clicked more than Douglas Engelbart, I'm as bossy as Bowser
Don't even remember all my e-mail addresses
And I've got more screen names than Sleepy's got matresses
I need the internet like Whitney Houston needs crack
If you feel the same way let me see you delicious this track

I spend more time online than Tim Berners-Lee
When I go to a club it's mostly a surf club you see
I've palpayed more money than you've got pictures on flickr
They call me the Uber-YouTuber, MySpace clicker
I love amateur homepages and dirt style design
The interweb's a ghetto full of gustatory crimes
Cross your fingers, make your hand look like a W and holla WEBSIIITE!

Hello my future girlfriend
This is how I sound like:

Let me see you shakin' it don't stop
Rub it down, bounce around, wiggle every pound
Get into the _hyperground everybody dance, jump if you're liking this sound

""Für mich seid ihr alle Raver""

Feel the bass drop hear the beat pop

When it's time to take off, climb the rooftop
Jump out of your shoe

Oonce oonce, happy-face balloons
Unfadeable pokey-tunes
Dance moves from shitty cartoons, pretty hot wounds
Hung over afternoons
The club's full with a whole sweaty nation that seems under the wrong medication
Rave invasion, it's a T-thang
Boing Peng Bum Tschack Peng!
Eins zwei Polizei drei vier Beuteltier fünf sechs Hypertext sieben acht Mitternacht

I battle fake emcees
That'll break their knees
And make 'em say ""now please""
You know I'm deadly with my rocksteady helmet on
When I run my show like an olympic marathon
Tracky, whack emcee
Wanted to enter the Wu but couldn't find my key
Sprechen sie deutsch, that's just all symbolic
Because I'm a [?] decked out polka-holic
At the Oktoberfest I test the best beer
Drunken monk style, it's a mess, but I have less fear
To attack, flip competitors on their back
Exactly like in Virtua Fighter Three
In the chamber, of torture
I'm gonna fold ya, like I told ya, Motherfucka
I don't need rhymin', I have the right timing
Like Arthur Lyman, I do the birth crying myself

Double-A battery packs in my pocket
Fresh like a supermarket
Don't make sense at all, well fuck it

I'm sorry 'bout our phony mails
But I love to see your pony tails
In motion, up and down
While I take you to funky town

Rollercoasting, sandwich toasting

Cause I'm fancy, trancy, underpantsy
Dirty like a sidewalk on Delancey
Cracky, whacky, what-the-hecky

Night life, we just fear it
Smells like teens without spirit
But don't you be afraid
Tracky Birthday go make you sweat till eight
With his armpit beaver, disco fever
Rocking till he convinced every disbeliever
So please may I suggest
To the ladies in this room to shake your chest

This like one guy high on crack
Taking this shit outside your door
You said ""hey cock sucker
Get lost motherfucker
I told you once before""
He just looks up, right at you
While squeezing out the biggest shit
He asks you for a light
You go back inside
While the guy takes another hit

It goes one for the money, two for the money
Three for the money, and four for the money
Was it ever about anything but the money
Hip-hop more commercial than the Easter-bunny
Let's rock, you don't stop
Make your fat asses go pop-lock-a-drop
What the fuck is up at dub the Tracky beat

I'm the uber-youtuber
Doogie Howser
German Schnauzer
Schnitzel Stroganoff

Cocktail, pot whale
Better go home and inhale
That stuff that you like to

Nobody, nobody can dance like
Nobody, nobody can dance like
Nobody, nobody can dance
Nobody, nobody can dance like you

Up, shake it up, shake it up, come on

Don't care
Chemicals are rushing through my veins
Don't tell me without Lulu's lips I'd be the same

And in the morning, made of sugar
Sun come melt me down
Don't tell me..
All I hear..

One reason
Walking down the street I don't fall down
Love conditional..
Here I kneel before a plastic shrine
Hollow Madonna, who's her maker?

Maybe I don't mind

"
21185,"

He's going to where I'll end up
Did you hit a fork in the road?
Spoonful of sugar is breaking your back
Knife come to cut the heavy load
Though it severs, give him some slack
He's going to where I'll end up
Time to travel on the black ford through dark waters
The wind on your back
Waves flowing gently nevermore
Pray for lights attack
He's going to where I'll end up
You might say to yourself I would never
When you're thinking out loud it's forever

"
21186,"

If you go away leave the tattoos on your arm
I'll stay and paint the lawn black
Vast generation gap
Want my television blank

Winding up their clocks to make time for tomorrow
The kids are alright in their pink tobacco cloud
Blue flowers fading in the sun
Hours spent in artificial light

Paint the lawn black
Dye my flowers blue

"
21187,"

Memory define all
Find the evidence gone
Light years away no song
No future to come

Is it happening now?
Hold the line or let fall
Narrate when you call

"
21188,"

Trace the veins on your arm
Count the polka dots of rain
If it prevents you from harm
If it distracts you from pain

Celebrate the mundane in the place of the divine
Casting a line to the other side

Alone in a room she's renaming the colors underneath the sun
In a lucid dream I tried to bring back things
I found for you in the ground
In made-up towns with fabricated skies of blue
But I couldn't bring them back from the dimension of black and white

They were trapped above the sun
Wait for me underneath the sun in the black and white

"
21189,"

Draw it out of dim decay
Don't crawl out of here until the lunar landing
One foot out to touch the glass
Dusty claw or shapely mass
Survey the landscape
Trust you will recalibrate
Now consume the atmosphere
Here where you are now

"
21190,"

Watching, waiting, step back
Deep sea, in darkness hiding
Long lens, electric light quake
Between planes of flying stone
I watch your face form print alone

As kerosene drips down the wall
Slide up and over
Rattled call

Solid or not the plans were birthing
You can look down
But don't lose your footing
How to prepare?
Could face disaster
Our epic tour, what are we after?

At the countdown there's no turning back
Is the earth round? I'm going to find out
Travel so far to find your answers
Back in your car burning in embers

"
21191,"

As you lay down on the broken lines
I called out to you
Give me shapes so I can build a house
We'll set fire to
Return to enter through the burning door
Walls were reaching high
Up the elevator to the place
Gardens mark the plane

"
21192,
21193,"

No one saw the uneven grass on that day
Night brings dreams to recapture fears, haunts you still
Wash the sand away, bring her here
Strangers come, pulling time
Disorients, rewind
Unfamiliar recognized
Unfamiliar bring her here

The truth can hurt
The truth'll make you cry
It will break you down and make you wish it was a lie
If you don't wanna lose her
You better move her
I said baby be a real straight shooter

You can look high
You can look low
But you won't find no man who's gonna love you anymore
If you don't wanna lose her
You better move her
Well baby be a real straight shooter

Don't what you want
And I don't know where to go
I told this and I told you once before
If you wanna move her
You don't wanna lose her
I said baby be a real straight shooter
Oh baby be a real straight shooter
I said baby be a real straight shooter

Freedom of birth has rooted me from the first
Leavin’ the worst curses muted to my feelin’ of worth
I’m bein’ reimbursed for puttin’ trees in the earth
So I’m grateful, ‘cause it’s hateful when you’re needin’ the work
The seasons reverse; in the spring, bees and the birds
Got a reason to sing, bringin’ their seeds into birth
And sprouts, pleasin’ to nurse, upsurge like a fountain
And begin’ to burst out the dirt up in the mountain
I’m countin’ the amount and the worth of all my poundin’
Runnin’ around, I work the ground, my words resoundin’
Verses abound, but the sound carries downwind
Drowned as it tarries ‘round the area I’m found in
Weight packin’ straight pounds around to break your back and
I make it happen; I race down mounds; I’m paper stackin’
My tapers blacken; late nights creatin’s the best
I’m breakin’ cheques, makin’ connects, wakin’ to sex
My achin’ breasts never takin’ less than they can invest
And I ain’t paid to rest, as any day can attest
I’m hatin’ the stress, but I’m lovin’ the freedom
I’m shakin’ the pesticides with gloves when I need ‘em
I’m racin’ the rest, numbers above and I beat ‘em
I’m makin’ a mess; I’ve got mud up to my knees, and
I’m shovin’ the trees in where I dug and then squeeze ‘em
I’m duckin’ no-see-ums and other bugs and I’m bleedin’
But under my breathin’ this is what I’m repeatin’

I chant this to replenish
Like a sandwich when you’re famished
Under bandages my hand is
Badly damaged, but I manage
By the handle grip to brandish
My shovel as I plant this
Great expanse of forest vanished
Where the planet has been branded
Trees get slammed into the slanted
Land with frantic speed I dance with
An enhanced sense of romantic
And I can’t get disenchanted

I’m draggin’ my feet; to get speed I shift gears
I fiercely lift my knees, and my fatigue disappears
My sweat drips swiftly; my lips bleed and get smeared
Which I lick quickly, 'cause it’s the sea mixed with tears
Clocks tick six year as I walk between trees
And the slash is deep with distracting green leaves
My dreams lead, and I seem to be fast asleep
I’m trapped in a deep trance, but I plant masterfully
I stand half-deceased at the end of my last screef
And when my hand slaps the tree in the sand, that’s just sweet
And actually, it’s past belief the feats I’ve had to pull
Wrapped in these rags of wool, tree bags full
I’m like a black sheep that’s track-meet speed compatible
To pass me you have to be released by a catapult
And every word that I speak is autobiographical
So follow my path; it’s all flagged with red tape
And I shed weight with each micro-site I impregnate
My shredded legs keep me upright to levitate
Up the block everyday, but the rocks never break
I’ve got to measure space and do whatever it takes
Some nights I lie in bed awake and shiver and shake
But I never let a late night get in the way
‘Cause every second I waste is like instead of my pay
And when I’ve got to separate my head and escape
From all the effort it takes, I just rap to meditate

I chant this to replenish
Like a sandwich when you’re famished
Under bandages my hand is
Badly damaged, but I manage
By the handle grip to brandish
My shovel as I plant this
Great expanse of forest vanished
Where the planet has been branded
Trees get slammed into the slanted
Land with frantic speed I dance with
An enhanced sense of romantic
And I can’t get disenchanted

I was a soldier boy in the twilight of my youth
When I still could feel love and a trust in above for the truth
I fought with bravery, then I left my gun behind
But the misery I've seen never wiped itself clean from my mind

Now I never, ever close my eyes completely
When I'm sleeping...

I barely recognize the people that I knew
The faces the same and I still couldn't name but a few
If god isn't dead, then I'll kill him myself
Cuz I've seen the worst, I'm not scared to just burst into hell

Now I never, ever close my eyes completely
When I'm sleeping, I'm not dreaming

Lazy bones strewn around the room
There will be no flame to consume
The unspeakable carnage they wrought

All done up, posed on the bed
It went to my head when you said
I had never looked better than that

Lazy bones
Lazy bones
Lazy bones
Lazy bones

Pulled apart and bleached by the sun
It's never much fun when you come
To conclusions to late
As the rainwater drips through
The steel drainage grate
And the fruits of your labors
All rot on your plate
You're left with sticks and stones

Margo, I need you to hear my reasoning for leaving
Without warning on that somber Sunday morning
Couldn't tell you where it was that I was going
'Cause I didn't even know for sure myself

If you hadn't gotten me so down
Then, Margo, I'd be more inclined to stick around

Margo, I heard that you don't want me anymore
From a friend that said that you were asking for me
So forgive me if my disbelief is showing
'Cause I only see your feelings for me growing

Though I've been trying to forget
The image of you left in bed
Beside you for the love the times we had (?)

You know, you'd gotten me so down
But, Margo, there are times I wish I stuck around

I wanna know girls who want to know men
I’m already stuck inside the head of one of them
I’m so loosely defined
I wanna draw your outline
On a fresh yard of snow
The burning leaf held by the stem

I wanna know girls, yeah every one I can
And mostly I’m not stupid, but I love what I can learn from them
Sometimes knowledge is a shock
Don’t push stuff by sharing rocks
You are my only sweetness and you know it
When you let yourself see it
That vibrating halo of tin

And let yourself be known
Let yourself be known
Don’t use words, we’re never alone
No, we’re never alone
And let yourself be known
Yeah, let yourself be known
We don’t need words, we’re never alone
No, we’re never alone

I wanna know girls that give me hope
That float by through the air
I love your feet and your legs
And everything going up from there
I was one thing I can always be had
But real love’s not up for grabs
You know men ruin everything, it’s true
But you and I, we can’t be spoiled so let’s be fair

I wanna know girls, but only love one
You’re my source of energy
Hook a panel up to me
And shine down on me like the sun
Now, you and your friends say love is blind
But I think it’s easy and kind
Or anyhow it could be
You buzzed me like it would be
You think we’re in the movies
But movies never move me
Don’t think that you can lose me
‘Cause love is like an uzi
It weighs a ton. Oh yeah, my love weighs a ton – Hey!

Isn't that the way?
Isn't that the way?

Flowering trees hang close to the river
And the welcoming party is fixing you drinks
The closer you get you can see that they're strangers
They're wearing your clothes they dyed 'em all black

Isn't that the way?
Isn't that just the way?

Honey, you know I'm watching now
Though I believe the lines are down
You're shaking me, I'm shaking too
But probably not as much as you

And do you think it's funny
That I can hardly come runnin' now
And I picture you in a crouch
Next to your San Andreas house

Did you just not hear the phone
Did you lose your house and home
Did the earth swallow you up
Or are you waiting for me

Shaking freeways I can't believe
Burning houses far and low
From our television crane
I hope that you have stayed the same

And do you think it's funny
That I can hardly come runnin' now
And I picture you in a crouch
Under your San Andreas house

Did you just not hear the phone
Did you lose your house and home
Did the earth swallow you up
Or are you waiting for me

Did you just not hear the phone
Did you lose your house and home
Did the earth swallow you up

I won't be around to cut your holiday trimmings down
I won't be there to hold your hand

From where I stand you don't appear to need it
And the summer end, like a ruined heir we tried to read it
Don't think we can

A spider you can't catch, a cunning rusty latch
A weatherman acting coy, a web you can't destroy

But I'm your boy
Although you may not need it
And the summer flew, I know how hard you tried to beat it
But we both knew

The light comes in much too early every day
It wakes me up but it won't chase those dreams away

The light comes in much too early every day
It wakes me up but it won't chase those dreams away

You're mental miles away
Long-distance, some might say
But I can't hear you say it
Time takes its toll but you still have to pay it

Whose charges get reversed
All depends on who calls first
You hang up in anger
Why raise a fist when you can't lift a finger?

Keeping the weekend free
In the event you call
Keeping myself locked up
Letting the weekend go
Waiting for my parole

You're seven digits far
However close you are
Close to desperation
Until you called with your kind invitation

You took to me
Like an axe takes to a tree
I was felled, you followed
Some lines are occupied, some rings are hollow

Keeping the weekend free
In the event you call
Keeping myself locked up
Letting the weekend go
Waiting for my parole

And tomorrow's falling down
Promises are breaking

Is rusting from the sun
And those candles

But one will do
I've got three beers to get me through
Just trying to write a song without you

All that jewelry
Will never buy back your soul
Your ways are wicked
Like a heart that's lost control
And those heroes
They've all turned to stone
So go to bed, girl
Feel what it's like to be alone

Comes real
With every swallow
Swallow

Tequila, my friend
Inhibitions with you
Always end
And break
You take me to a better place

The only time you think of me now is when you're in between an R and O
With your heart on your shelf you must be pleased with yourself it's slowly turning into stone
Is there another lover there in your room, does he even know about me?
Can there be any doubt that from here on out
This debris, it's all that's left of me

When you look down deep into the pit of my heart can you find the weakest link
With your low little reef and your broken teeth I ain't never gonna be your friend
Is there another lover there in your room, does he even know about me?
And can there be any doubt that from here on out
This debris, it's all that's left of me

The only interest you have in love is to see it broken down
You would tear it apart just to prove that you're smart, you would burn me down
Is there another lover there in your room, does he even know about me?
And can there be any doubt that from here on out
This debris, it's all that's left of me

There's something that you don't know
That keeps all your friends busy talking
And when you come around then it's a scene

Now they say that it can't hurt you
But I know better now
The truth can't hurt as much as a lie

Now that whisper campaign's gonna bring you shame
And I don't wanna be no ball and chain
I don't know how I'll ever let it slide

Now every time I see your face
It just puts me right in my place
How long will it take me to forget?

And there's lots of things that you don't know
That keep your friends busy talking
But when you come around then it's a scene
Yeah, a scene

"
22535,"

My heart won't let you go
Even though I often try and tell it so
There are some things it just won't do
No matter how many times I tell it to

Cause it still thinks that you are mine
And it still seems to think you are so kind
So do it a favor and help it to remind
And break it for me one more time
One more time

Since you've gone there's no one else
But it comes to you I can't seem to control myself
But my heart can't see all the things you do
When you go walking round town with someone

It still thinks that you are mine
And it still seems to think you are so kind
So do it a favor and help it to remind
And break it for me one more time
One more time
Baby break it for me
One more time
Make it hurt
Help it to remind
And break it for me
One more time

I hear the bells
Ringing in my ear
Telling me that the time of decision is near

Pierce this night
With your honey voice
Let me know that I still have a choice

I wandered long without compass or direction
Now you want both my comfort and protection
In a world that is so cruel

Wise men masquerade as fools
And I wait to hear your footsteps and yours alone
Please guide me home

For promises undone
We must pay the price
Who knows this chance
May not come twice

I wandered long without compass or direction
And now you want both my comfort and protection
In a world that is so cruel

Wise men masquerade as fools
And I wait to hear your footsteps and yours alone

The truth can hurt
The truth'll make you cry
It will break you down and make you wish it was a lie
If you don't wanna lose her
You better move her
I said baby be a real straight shooter

You can look high
You can look low
But you won't find no man who's gonna love you anymore
If you don't wanna lose her
You better move her
Well baby be a real straight shooter

Don't what you want
And I don't know where to go
I told this and I told you once before
If you wanna move her
You don't wanna lose her
I said baby be a real straight shooter
Oh baby be a real straight shooter

Atira no meu coração

Me diz versos à toa
Me traz da sua rua

Me tira dessa solidão

Carabina, gasolina
Na surdina do trompete
Anilina do esmalte
Da menina marinete

Mais um dia besta
Aqui no meu mocó
Quero fazer contato
Engrossar o caldo do mocotó
Descarregar direto pro oco da cabeça
Neurônios descontrolados
É nós e tá ligado
Então deixa cair

Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto sossegado
Compacto um fino um raro
Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto então deixa cair
Compacto sossegadinho
Compacto em eletricidade
Compacto

Sentir a raiz crescer sob seus pés
Deixar a tampa se abrir
É nós e bote fé
Então deixa cair

Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto sossegado
Compacto no meu canto no meu lado
Compacto um fino um raro
Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto então deixa cair
Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto no meu canto no meu lado
Compacto quietinho sossegado
Compacto

Estamos prontos para juntá-los
E cantar uma pequena rotina em estilo livre
Tudo isso ao som da música
Use somente sua imaginação
E faça o que lhe faz sentir bem
Se você tiver algum problema
Não fique desencorajado
Simplesmente volte ao início do corte
E comece novamente
Vamos então escutar
Compacto
Junto com os melhores
Pronto, preparado e já
Um dois três quatro

Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto então deixa cair
Compacto que eu só quero ouvir
Compacto no meu canto no meu lado
Compacto quietinho sossegado
Compacto um fino um raro
Compacto então deixa cair
Então deixa cair

You left home the other night
I won't see you for a couple days
But I still leave on all the lights
And all your stuff is still in place
Where you left it

You turned me into a wreck
I swear I hear you coming through that door
But every time I go to check
You're not there and I swear not to fall for that no more

Oh my God, could this be? Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
And if I die before I wake, the dreams of you were my escape
I'm falling for you

A TV lights an empty room
That shines upon me laying in my bed
As every memory of you
All night long since you've been, is running through my head

Oh my God, could this be? Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
And if I die before I wake, the dreams of you were my escape
I'm falling for you

Oh, can't seem to get you off my mind
Oh, no matter how i try and try
Oh, every time I blink my eyes all i see is you

Oh my God, could this be? Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
And if I die before I wake, the dreams of you were my escape
I'm falling for you

It is nice to know you and now that we've met
You've been really kind and I hope you don't regret it yet
You could half become my brother
You could half become my friend
But I cannot stand such kindness, I'd better bring this to an end

Before I start
Before I start

And rather than to lose it I would have it dumped at sea
You could half become my brother
You could half become my friend
But I would only disappoint you, so let's bring this to an end

Before I start to sabotage you
Before I start to watch us drift apart

(Watch us drift apart)
(Watch us drift apart)
(Watch us drift apart)

The me that you know's always sweet and polite
But another part emerges when I'm all alone at night
This one's out to bring it on you, this one's willing to destroy
So run for cover, place no trust in me, or I'll complicate you, boy

Before I start to sabotage you
Before I start (to complicate you)
Before I start to sabotage you
Before I start (to complicate you)

You're gonna do what you want
Every night every night living with a
Girlfriend on the verge of total breakdown

You and I
Baby I just don't wanna talk about it
And then it's if you mind
Maybe I'll write a song about it

My dear, I'll give you sixty seconds to disappear
And if you don't get out of here... who knows?
Cuz I've been trying to find out if an angel bends or breaks
Or shatters like a stone

I... I want to destroy something beautiful
For you, I want to destroy for you

Tonight, there's only an inch between pain and delight
And I'm full of Canadian whiskey and spite again
Destruction and creation are the same thing after all

I... I want to destroy something beautiful

Destruction and creation are the same thing after all
The mighty always fall

For you, I want to destroy for...

[Chorus (Refrein)]
Doe de Kropotkin
Dans met ons mee
Een steen naar de flikken
En de B.O.B

Dans de Kropotkin
Het is nu de tijd
Voor de revolutie
En de klassenstrijd

[Verse (Couplet) 1]
Beu om te werken
In een klotenfabriek?
Steek dan die handel
Gewoon in de fik!

[Chorus (Refrein)]
Doe de Kropotkin
Dans met ons mee
Een steen naar de flikken
En de B.O.B

Dans de Kropotkin
Het is nu de tijd
Voor de revolutie
En de klassenstrijd

[Verse (Couplet) 2]
Is je personeelschef
Een groot stuk verdriet?
Verbeter de werksfeer
Dan met dynamiet!

[Chorus (Refrein)]
Doe de Kropotkin
Dans met ons mee
Een steen naar de flikken
En de B.O.B

Dans de Kropotkin
Het is nu de tijd
Voor de revolutie
En de klassenstrijd

[Verse (Couplet) 3]
Geen geld om te zuipen
Of niet genoeg dop?
Beroof dan de
CERA, K.B. of BACOB!

[Chorus (Refrein)]
Doe de Kropotkin
Dans met ons mee
Een steen naar de flikken
En de B.O.B

Dans de Kropotkin
Het is nu de tijd
Voor de revolutie
En de klassenstrijd

[Verse (Couplet) 4]
Vergiftig het leger!
Vernietig de staat
En ook al die pedo’s
Van ’t episcopaat!

On the glass that wraps the telephone box
An impatient bystander knocks
The receiver, put it back back down in it's place
In the some things should be said to the face
I'm a believer
You're stripped of all your worldly powers
And staring at the opposite apartment block for hours
You say that each window is just a TV channel
And you'd surrender all your so-called friends for flowers
And you'd rather be sleeping in the paddocks with the horses
While the stars cross the sky's on their prescribed courses
Can you take me with you when you go?
Because love is just a lazy generalisation that we use for 100 different feelings and as many situations
Going through each others pockets is not like us and flattery should get you somewhere and your happiness is just a chemical
A constant feeling you're being watched
All your good intentions so clumsily botched
A kiss sent down the telephone line can come out sounding like a bug getting squashed
And grasshoppers fling erratic parabolas
While you're drowning ants with your can of cola
Can you take me with you when you go?
Because love is just a lazy generalisation that we use for 100 different feelings and as many situations
Going through each others pockets is not like us and flattery should get you somewhere and your happiness is just a chemical
It's just a chemical
Separate the parts and give them titles
Lungs are for songs and eyes are for feasting
And butter's for a bee sting
Can somebody please check my vitals?
Because love is just a lazy generalisation that we use for 100 different feelings and as many situations
Finding things others pockets isn't always a plus and that sensation that you felt up the back of the bus is just a chemical
Yeah happiness is just a chemical
Yeah it is

One thing about all this clock punching
Brings back meaning to the weekend
The heat gets shut off at midnight
Noises seem louder with the lights off
You eat and sleep and dream and ride your bike through the slip stream
On footpaths that weren't built for bikes let alone people
They're full of trucks and cars and dotted with topless bars
This land that once was promised ours treats you like a stranger
Hold on, my love, hold on
If only for that cloud who burst it's skin and cried out loud
And sent us running with the crowd, the concert ruined
The cute smiles of young boys beckon, if only for 9 seconds
I know you're lonely so if only for the 'if only'
Hold on, my love, hold on
Oh please try to rest those peepers, you're jealous of easy sleepers
Try not to think too hard, you might break something
Sometimes my biggest fear is a dressing room between two mirrors, watching myself disappear forever and ever..
Hold on, my love, hold on

Yeah, I found out
Don't blow it when you've had enough
Yeah, I found out
Just carry on and live it up

"

Come alive and let the motion rock you
Let it send you off to sleep
Come inside there's nothing left to shock you
Now you've landed on your feet
Then after all the fun is over
You will still have all the memories
Come alive and see the world through all the trees

Come alive
You know it's more than breathing
Have to wrestle with your soul
Show it that you're close to understanding
Don't give up and think you're too old
And then after all the fun is over
You will still have all the memories
Come alive and see the world through all the trees

Feel the change rising up inside you
See the fear scare itself away
Find a road leading back to your life
Come alive give the rest away
Come alive give the rest away

And then after all the fun is over
You will still have all the memories
Come alive and see the world through all the trees

Bright dunny day
It's ok
We are wearing
Sun lotion

I was laying there
Thinking 'bout taking off
Sunday morning
And I was just waking up

Looking at the sky
In my coffee cup
Sugar you're sweeter
Yes I'll meet you at 10 o'clock
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Bright sunny day
It's ok
We are wearing
Sun lotion
I've got the wheels
Bring the thrills
We are wearing
Sun lotion

We were laughing like kids in a candy store
We went flying but our feet never left the floor
If you're getting high
Then I want some more
Taste like honey
Who needs money when you've got the score
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Bright sunny day
It's ok we are wearing
Sun lotion
I've got the wheels
Bring the thrills
We are wearing sun lotion

At the end when the sun is falling
We'll play til the break of dawn
At the end when the sun is falling

I'll do anything you want
I'll help you make the right decisions
I'll give you somewhere soft to land on the way down

Been sleeping underwater
Holding my breath 'til you came along
You walk around the corner
Carry me home to where I belong

Hey how does it feel?
Once in a lifetime
Two may find each other
Hey nothing's more real
Now that the search is over
Two together and you know you're the one
(know you're the one)

You do anything I want
You only have to breath to move me
You try to take the load right off when I'm weighed down

Been sleeping underwater
Holding my breath 'til you came along
You walk around the corner
Carry me home to where I belong

Hey how does it feel?
Once in a lifetime
Two may find each other
Hey nothing's more real
Now that the search is over
Two together and you know you're the one
(Know you're the one)

I needed love
You gave it to me
Warm like the sun
You give and you give
You're lifting the world around you

Hey how does it feel?
Once in a lifetime
Two may find each other
Hey nothing's more real
Now that the search is over
Two together

Hey how does it feel?
Once in a lifetime
Two may find each other
Hey nothing's more real
Now that the search is over
Two together and you know you're the one
Two together and you know you're the one

If you say nothing will be coming your way
What may come, you chase it away
Create your own fate

If you smile
Something in the world's gonna change
Something in you won't be afraid
Create your own fate

Will you be missed when you are gone?
If something shifts, do you take too long?

You're feeling so misunderstood
It's like an endless ocean
You count to ten but it's no good
You find you're wasting your time
But doesn't feel good?

On a plate
Nothing comes to us on a plate
No thank you, I already ate
Create your own fate

Will you be missed when you are gone?
If something shifts, do you take too long?

You're feeling so misunderstood
It's like an endless ocean
You count to ten, but it's no good
You find you're wasting your time
But doesn't it feel good?

"
24256,"

It's nearly time to set the wheels in motion
We've got ideas this world won't allow
Got us so far this notion
It's how we came to be the stars we are

Where did it all go?
Will I get it in the next life?
Oh you think that you know
But we will never walk the same line

When we come we will come together
Safe in our little bubble world
Giving the best devotion
Making off in a cloud of smoke

Hit Me
Hurt me
Kill me
I get what I deserve

Kiss me
Love me
Thrill me
Get what I deserve

Where did it all go?
Will I get it in the next life?
Oh you think that you know
But we will never walk the same line

Put on your running shoes
You're never gonna win the race 'til you do
We all have hidden truths
You're never gonna race again if we lose

Where did it all go
Will I get it in the next life
Oh you think that you know
But we can never make the deadline
Put on your running shoes
You're never gonna win the race til you do
We all have our issues
We're never gonna face the day if we lose X2

La la la la la la la la la la la

"
24257,"

All I have to do
Is make life better
I shout
But no one is around
Slowly make a move
Away from knowing
Silence has a sweeter sound
What's better for me
Might not be better for you
What can you do?
What can you do?

Why won't you come, my friend
Revive
Bring it on, my friend
Revive

What are we to do?
It takes forever
And yet it takes no time at all
Let me introduce
A view of heaven
Before we walk into a fall
What's better for me
Might not be better for you
What can you do?
What can you do?

Why won't you go, my friend
Revive
Bring it on, my friend
Revive
Let it come, my friend
Revive

Let it come, my friend
Revive
Bring it on, my friend
Revive
Let it come, my friend
Revive

Let it come, my friend
Let it come, my friend
Let it come, my friend
Revive

I remember when I was just a baby
When somebody told me everything was all right
Was my mother right before she drove my crazy
Chewing on her lips like a witch cooking suicide

I'm so sick of hearing
Things are gonna work out
Well I'm so sick of hearing
Things are gonna be all right

In the kitchen there's a cuban with a pistol
He got an itchy trigger finger sticking in your side
Holds you tight and at this range he ain't gonna miss you
And no one else will girl cause you're already dead inside

Ain't you sick of hearing
Things are gonna work out
Well ain't' you sick of hearing
Things are gonna be all right

Well somebody lied
Somebody lied
Somebody lied
Somebody lied

Well everybody talks alot of pretty stories
But when they talk you know they don't even
Look you in the eye

And everybody's got a crystal ball to look into the future
But we all know that tomorrow's just a lie

Your lying naked on the bathroom floor now
Another day and you don't bother keeping score now
He's getting vicious as he's walking through the door now
And don't you know you're running out of time

They all said that everything was gonna change now
They told you all good things would come to people in good time
What's the different when you're living like you are now
Suck a strangers dick just trying to make some money to survive

Everybody talks alot of pretty stories
But when they talk you know they don't even
Look you in the eye

And you know you ain't gonna live forever
You can't even hold your self together
As the days go by

Your lying naked on the bathroom floor now
Another day and you don't bother keeping score now
He's getting vicious as he's walking through the door now
And don't you know you're running out of time

"

Sun comes up
I'm counting the days I've got left
I'm counting the time on my hands, watch the days roll by

When I'm gone
Who will be waiting for me to come home?
Who waits for a ghost to come in from the cold, just to haunt you?

Sometimes girl I'm already gone, I've been ready so long
In your heart there's a different man, and I just ain't that strong
I can't win
I can't lose
And everything I do is wrong
One hand clawing at the other hand, trying to hold on

Sun goes down
If I stay too long then I'll just fade away
And if you were smart you would just walk away, don't you cry

When I'm gone
I know for certain the birds will still sing
And I know the clouds will still cry like a child, on my shadow

Sometimes girl I'm already gone, I've been ready so long
In your heart there's a different man, and I just ain't that strong
I can't win
I can't lose
And everything I do is wrong
One hand clawing at the other hand, trying to hold on

See no pee no hot outside 4x

Im 5 ft. 7
You know im a little buttercup x4

If we flew to LA we could all go
We could live in a little bungalow

I could still keep my job in washington
And set world records on the phone

In a little ride
In a little ride roll
(if you flew to LA we could all go, we could live in a little bungalow)

Im 5 ft. 7
You know im a little buttercup

Dear Anh
Wish that i was tan
How are things in LA?

Orlando's oak trees groan
From the daily gulf breeze sway
If im right we'll power through the day
And play outside in the night

Time of the night same as the day
We could stay in the pool
You got such a nice pool
We could stay in the pool
You got such a nice pool
You got all the best movies
It's the best downstairs 5 ft. 7
You know im a little buttercup
(we could stay in the pool)
(tonstartssbandht)
(its the best downstairs)

I get lost sometimes
When my work won't grab me
From the pull of the outside world

And there's a song we sing
That leaves us always burning
For them things we've yet to find

Singing
We won't stop believing
We'll be young always
We know when it's time
To be working on a twelve pack instead of 9 to 5

And 9 to 5 gives us the fuel for the ride
As we cruise through this life past them speed limit signs
We've seen a few drunken nights and some stories unfold
Set down the stress and replace with a brew
Don't quit your day job, but take a few breaks
Not just for sleep or for sanity's sake
But for waters uncharted and the good friends of old
For the love of the ladies, and the bullshit we've sold
Put down them papers, empty those minds
Turn up the music it's time to unwind
I got some time on my side and the world to see
It's just a few of my friends and the song that we sing
Sing it

We won't stop believing
We will be young always
We know when it's time
To be working on a twelve pack instead of 9 to 5

And I am found sometimes
When my reason leaves me
Taken over by the outside world

And there's a song we sing
That leaves us always yearning
For them things we've yet to find

Cvees (ft. Probe DMS, Ike P, and Swave Sevah) - “Dro Please”
[Emcee(s): Probe DMS, Ike P, and Swave Sevah]
[Producer(s): Probe DMS]
[Vocals: [?]]

[Hook: [?]] (x2)
Roll that dro, please
And lick.  Come on, son, roll that up
And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

[Verse 1: Probe DMS]
Well, it was
One of them nights around five to ten
I blew my last L trying to get high again
So I called up my good old supplier friend
He went as low as a ten for dro, yo
Two could roll a L as thin as a pig pen
But if I spend twenty, that’ll be half of my money
Man, fuck it.  I’ma call up my dunny and
See if he got half in the stash for the gummies

[Verse 2: Ike P, Probe DMS, and Female]
Well, I’m in the crib, busting the grub, eating the funnies
The phone rings.  “Probe, what’s cracking?”  “Ain’t shit.  What up?”
“We need to meet up and go half on this spliff”
“That’s cool, but, first, I got to ditch this straggling bitch
‘Cause, once she smell it, she wants to inhale it, always like
'What’s popping?' but never come out of her pockets to get it""
“Ayyo, y’all trying to get the smoke, yo?” “Stop running
Your mouth and hang up my phone.  This ain’t your house”
She like:

[Hook: [?]] (x2)
Roll that dro, please
And lick.  Come on, son, roll that up
And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

[Verse 3: Probe DMS]
Haha, Swave, we bounced without the spouses
I know this house party that’s down a couple of houses
They got the Bacardi.  I copped a couple of ounces
We ‘bout to bent on a couch like some slouches

[Verse 4: Swave Sevah]
Word?  Well, I got something to add.  May not be
As much as a ounce but it’s a nice-sized bag
And it’s the highest strain that you could put in your body
It’s serious—I’ll let you smell it when we get in the lobby
Whoa!  There’s a lot of hoes at this party
Oh!  Look at her.  I know she’s a hottie
Yo, pass me the Dutch, let me twist these trees.  Ayyo
Probe, I think shorty’s licking her lips at me

[Verse 5: Probe DMS]
Woah, I think
So.  Shorty grinding like she toe-back
That’s when I pulled out something to roll like, “Hold that”
That’s when she strolled over, sat on me, gave me a lap dance
With romance in her voice, looking Janet-mold, she said:

[Hook: [?]] (x2)
Roll that dro, please
And lick.  Come on, son, roll that up
And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

[Verse 6: Swave Sevah, Ike P, and Female]
Damn it, yo
I’m coming up short.  Yo, I got to get my cheese up
Let me go outside and just strip you this re-up
I just finished stuffing these bags.  Y’all better grab
A couple dimes and dubs and post up on the ave
In spite of my nigga Ike, about to ""Walk On"" fast
“Ayyo, Ike, what’s good, dawg?”  “I’ll stay in the hood, god
You’re just the person that I needed to see.  Give
Me three.”  “Yo, keep your money, god.  This one’s on me.”  “Yo, look, yo
Who this bitch that walking up with the cheese?”  “Yo, that’s that bitch
Shantise.  She always trying to burn the next man’s trees.”  “I seen you
Smoking, Sevah.” “We’re busy.  You might as well continue
Your route ‘cause there’s no way the blunt is touching your mouth”
“Yo, keep it moving, Shanty.  Just walk that path straight
Don’t be pulling that shit—it’s new-old and half-baked.”  Then right
Before she decided to skate, she licked her lips
With the thirst in her face.  She was dying to say, “Can we...”

[Hook: [?]] (x2)
Roll that dro, please
And lick.  Come on, son, roll that up
And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

Cvees (ft. Probe DMS) - “For You”
[Emcee(s): Probe DMS]
[Producer(s): Probe DMS]

[Verse 1: Probe DMS]
Yo, I’ll sometimes hate making beats around my peeps ‘cause
When I’ll press, they’ll always got something to say like
“Yo (Yo), why your tempo so slow and
(Yo) Yo (Yo, yo), why your chords be so mellow?”  But
I’ll stay cool like Jell-O even though I’m upset
They’ll talk about being amped when my art is the subject
And every time I’ll start a project, I’ll hear them yapping about
Platinum and me not reaching the charts yet, not realizing
I take it to heart.  And if you understood
That, well then just know that this one is
For you

[Bridge 1: Probe DMS]
This one is for you (This one is for you), this one is for you (This one is for you)
This one is for you (This one is for you), this one is for you (This one is for you)
This one is for you

[Verse 2: Probe DMS]
And each and every one in my crew
Don’t me mad.  Just be glad for the things that I do
I’m the known king of slang.  Watch them niggas cling to
My bozack.  Talking this and that, I’ll have my girl sing to
A fool.  Use each and every one of my tools
To have them thirst niggas drooling.  Cats be mad ‘cause I’m a-
-llergic to high hats.  They’d rather have shiny raps
Come on, who you fooling?  I’m all into music
Not only do I like it dirty, grimy, infused with
Jazz.  You got to represent hip hop and rap your ass off
Not ten percent hip hop, ninety percent do a rap song
If it’s true that this is what you do, well then this is for you

[Hook: Probe DMS] (x8)
And this is for you (And this is for you), and this is for you (And this is for you)

[Verse 3: Probe DMS]
Instead of getting props, I’m getting hours to swap tracks
You act like you wear the time—yo, stop that
And you don’t rule Cvees and
And I know majority, two out of three wins
Fuck it.  Don’t rhyme on my tracks, then try
To climb on my back after I blow when I’m fat
I’ll design serene tracks to ease back
And write in lash mode to keep drops intact
Probe a hundred percent hip hop, not rap.  I’ll never
Drip drop or hit the pit stop.  I’ll never
Flip flop or floss a wristwatch.  Hot
Damn, I’m a man that’ll get props.  And if
You stand in my way, you’ll just get mopped, so please
Stop popping all that shit.  I’m getting sick like
The flu, switched up my whole damn crew
Pimped ‘em.  If you got these symptoms, well then this for you

[Hook: Probe DMS] (x8)
And this is for you (And this is for you), and this is for you (And this is for you)

[Verse 4: Probe DMS]
You’re mad ‘cause I’ll rock a Lo cap with a knapsack
Damn right, motherfucker, I’m a backpacker
And I’ll attack any of you sad, wack rappers
We’re real hip hoppers and y’all are all actors
We’re true emcees—y’all could all see the factors
Of beats on envy and graffiti in the flat book
Float on my back with the flow that’s spectacular
Hold that, revert back to old rap vernacular
In case you forgot, my main
Purpose is to preserve real hip hop, and all
Y’all deserve that hot hip hop, so here
It go.  Shit, play it out of control.  That’s how
We do it.  New shit out of the blue, kid
You stick it in the... with the phlegm as the fluid
You nah’m saying?  Shit.  If you’re listening
To my crew, well you definitely know that this is for you

[Hook: Probe DMS] (x16)
And this is for you (And this is for you), and this is for you (And this is for you)

Cvees (ft. Ike P) - “Spread Love to Ya”
[Emcee(s): Ike P]
[Producer(s): Probe DMS]
[Sample: Take 6 - ""Spread Love""]

[Intro: Sample from Take 6 - ""Spread Love""]
I know somebody who declares he's got it made
He won't admit it, but it's just a masquerade

[Verse 1: Ike P]
Ayyo, butter
I don’t know what to say or think, but somehow
These words’ll come out as I burn this haze and drink
I’ll remember when I first met you.  Summer of ninety-
-one.  Who would ever think that the god would sweat you?
If you ask for my time, I would never neglect you
Or disrespect you, risk my own life to protect you
My, you’re more than a precious jewel, diamond in the rough
Dimes you’ll love to puff and you’re crazy cool
Mocha complexion and texture of your hair is smooth
Mesmerized by your eyes while I stare at you
Plus, the softness of your lips—shit—there are no words to
Describe it.  Loving you is my primary assignment
Just give me your list of promises to keep, and, on the dotted line
I’ma sign it.  Your voice is harmony like the wine is
We could make beautiful music together—then it’s Ashford
And Simpson.  Solid as a rock, I’ll never lose interest
Hugs and kisses

[Hook: Ike P]
Yeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya
(You’re gully, ma) Yeah, momma, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya

[Verse 2: Ike P]
Baby, I know
You’re dealing with your personal issues.  I have some of
My own.  We’ve both been searching for our comfort zone
But while we’re doing that, I can’t ignore the fact that I’m feeling
You heavy, and you’re a shortcut to Heaven, most definitely
I know that money’s not an object, but if I had it
To splurge—that’s my word—you’d be out of Douglass Projects
I know that you deserve the best, fine wine and
Cuisine, top-of-the-line designer things
A fee with the navigational screen, pounds of purple
And green, full wear to switch up daily for weeks
You told me you love diamonds—fine.  Open your mind
‘Cause, if I could, I’d throw you a whole coalmine
Through my gray skies, you’re my rays of sunshine
And I don’t have to worry ‘bout you crying—not one time
‘Cause, not only are you classy and sassy, but the streets
Is in your bloodstream and get your grizzly on for the green
You heard me?

[Hook: Ike P]
Yeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya
(You’re gully, ma)

[Bridge 1: Sample from Take 6 - ""Spread Love""]
What the
World needs now (I'm telling you)
(Love is what we need) is love, more
Love is what we need.  What the
World needs now is (We need more love)
Love (Whoo!).  More
Love is what we need

[Hook: Ike P]
Yeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya
(You’re gully, ma) Yeah, momma, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya

[Outro: Sample from Take 6 - ""Spread Love""]
Spread love (Hey)
We’ve got to spread love (Instead of spreading lies)
Spread love (Oooh)
Dah, dah-dah (The truth needs no disguise, oh)
(Said love)
(Could open any door, but I)
(Wish we had much more)
More love is what we need—need...
Spread love
Dah, dah-dah
Spread love
Dah, dah-dah.  (I've often)
(Said love)
(Could open any door, but I wish we)
(Had much more)
More love is what we need

I don't know what it means to feel anymore (x4)

Break my arm on the back of the chair
I don't care who you tell
What I tell you to do to my face
In the night
In the back
Of the car
'Cause It never hurt, never hurt
Never hurt the fuck at all

I don't know who the king of the prom was
And I don't even think I remember your name anymore
It's okay
It really don't matter at all to me
Know when the drum machine calls... (x2)

I don't know what it means to feel anymore
I don't know what it means to be anymore
I don't know what it means to live anymore
I don't know what it means to care anymore
I don't know what it means to love anymore
I don't know what it means to hurt anymore
I don't know what it means to kill anymore
I don't know what it means to feel anymore

This is not my fucking war
But i'm gonna fight it anyway
This is not my fucking gun
But I'm gonna fire it
This is not my fucking god
But I'm gonna bow to him anyway
This is not my fucking song
But I'm gonna sing it
This is not my fucking dick
But i'm gonna suck it anyway
This is not my fucking life
But i don't give a fuck... Fuck... FUCK

This is not (x 14)

Oh SHIT

I don't know what it means to feel anymore (x 7)
I don't know what it means to be anymore
I don't know what it means to live anymore
I don't know what it means to care anymore
I don't know what it means to love anymore
I don't know what it means to hurt anymore
I don't know what it means to kill anymore
I don't know what it means to feel anymore

I don't know what it means to feel anymore (x 7)
I don't know what it means to be anymore
I don't know what it means to feel anymore
I don't know what it means to live anymore
I don't know what it means to feel anymore
I don't know what it means to care anymore

Know when the drum machine calls me...

I don't know what it means to feel anymore
I don't know what it means to be anymore
I don't know what it means to live anymore
I don't know what it means to care anymore
I don't know what it means to love anymore

I'm gonna get my bathing suit on
Gonna get my base face on
Gonna get my hat out of loan
Gonna get my space face on

I'm gonna turn all snakes into bone
Go wishing the stone
Keep the crystal cat cold
Gotta get the throne

Hope my baby
May we meet a beastman
Hold us there
Happy but by one hand

Gonna get my pile of stone
Gonna my loud loud gong
Gonna get my men into rows
You better cover dem toes

Big carrot throne
Let them take a load
The crystal cat gets cold

Direntang waktu yang berjejal dan memburai, kau berikan sepasang tanganmu terbuka dan membiru dendam
Dibibir yang curam dan dunia tertinggal gelap membeku, sungguh petang nelangsa dan udara yg terbakar jauh
Kita adalah sepasang kekasih yang pertama bercinta di luar angkasa, seperti tak kan pernah pulang, kau membias di udara dan terhempaskan cahaya, seperti tak kan pernah pulang tuk langkahmu menarilah jauh mengudara
Jejak langkah menghilang tertulis dan menghilang karna kita telah bercinta di luar angkasa

My apartment
It looks just like your apartment
With four walls but two times all the space inside
And the space between all these high-rise apartment buildings

And the windows in your apartment building are televisions
And they collect the images from far and wide
I'm in the air all around while your cable's under the ground
Your wires in the trees
Look out, I'm on TV
These gray boxes, well, they're OK computers
But they'll keep me inside nearly all of the time
Singing ""don't ever leave me, lover""

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I’m going to the discount store
Yeah I’m going to the discount store
Can’t afford what I used to afford and I hardly even noticed

[Verse 2]
I’m going to the discount store
Yeah I’m going to the discount store
Can’t afford what I used to afford
And I hardly even noticed
Know this

[Chorus]
Knowing that the world’s an awful great big place
And I am awful small
It really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise
To find i don’t really matter at all

[Verse 3]
Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
I know you’ve got to be at work by nine
To keep food upon the platter

[Verse 4]
Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
I know you’ve got to be at work at nine
As if it really mattered
Mattered

[Chorus]
Mattered that the clock needs punching
The man is watching
And the union’s gone for good
With all this freedom how come there’s no fun
Left in the neighborhood?

[Verse 5]
A&R woman has central air
A&R woman has central air
Every day I walk up three flights of stairs
And it’s getting hot this summer

[Verse 6]
Label president has got health care
Label president has got health care
Every day I walk up three flights of stairs
And it’s really hot this summer
Bummer

[Chorus]
Bummer that the world’s a great big awful place
And frequently unfair
It really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise
That there’s just not enough to share
Aaaaaaah

[Outro]
We're going to the discount store
Yeah we're going to the discount store
Can’t afford what we used to afford
And we hardly even noticed

Everything old everything told
Crowd get your bass so low
Dance to explode and buy back your soul

When we sing words we bring
And the story comes alive
To share a though inside it fought
The meaning wants to hide
But do you know what's old is new
Tell a friend and talk it through
Don't be yellow when I am blue
It is a mystery give me a clue

I won't say that you're wrong
Everybody sing along
I won't say that you're wrong

It makes you feel down down down
Keep your feet on the ground
Don't let them ruin our sound

[Verse 1]
By the shattered calls of a mother's arms
All swept-inside like the rosary
That fell away when her girlish charms
Cried out to take on motherhood
She waits by the windowsill
All wrapped in white and puzzling
What happened to the child inside?
Who ran the streets and the days at night...

[Chorus]
She says, ""Nothing seems the same.""
And, ""I can't change a thing.""
""My body's like a wave, breaking to the sea.""
She says, ""Everything seems strange.""
Locked behind the years

But life is ours to find, in the days at night

[Verse 2]
There passes a stranger every eve
Who walks himself on a silver-leash
And in his head, the worlds asleep
Or, so the wrinkles in his hands believe
When he was young, he had a dream
To be a star, on the movie-screen
Now it all seems a silly lie
As he walks alone
And, the days on fire

[Chorus]
He says, ""Nothing seems the same.""
And, ""I can't feel a thing.""
""My bodies like a wave, caving in on me""
He says, ""Everything seems strange.""
Holding back the tears

And he smiles just like a child
In the days at night

Mother of song
You'll find the right way
To cherish in dreams
All of the small things

Father in time
You'll find a world

You'll find the right way

[Verse 1]
A part of me - you have
A part of me - you hold
Apart from me - you stand
And there's parts that you have stole

[Verse 2]
You collect them in the cupboards
Like the pieces of a puzzle
And nest just like a mother
In the dampness of your sweater
And it's never put together
As I've watched you from the window
Behind the curtains, winter
Moves slowly as a tether
To wrap around you tightly
As lovers will in meadows
To fall in love with shadows
Where the snow is all but melted
And it's never put together
It's never put together
Behind the curtains, winter
Falls slowly as a feather

[Chorus]
A part of you - I have
The part of you - I hide
A part of you I hold
The part you left behind

Call on me, I'll be there always

And call on me
I'll be there always

And call on me
I'll be there always

The part you left behind

As processions fade
New hearts doubt
But you are Golden and no one questions it
But who you fake and how you sound
Asks the best of men
To share your sentiment

[Chorus]
I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about
Dreaming of the South
And all those lost goodbyes
And all those lonely tears
You never got to cry

[Verse 2]
It never works out right
Unless you're one to follow
Where the silence takes too long
When the night falls--when the night falls oh so slow
And caution isn't ours
When the night falls--when the night falls oh so low
We may lose control

[Chorus]
I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about
Dreaming of the South
And all those lonely nights
And all those lost goodbyes
You never got to sigh

[Chorus]
I want to be the one to help you find those dreams
Because you've been hanging around
Talking about the South
And all those balmy nights
And all those lonely songs
You never got to write

[Refrain]
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through the door
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door

[Verse 1]
A loose, and hazy time
When you were not my Clementine
And I was not your diamond's eye

Bereft, as daisies lie
For our love was not lost in style
You were strong, I was a child

[Chorus]
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

[Verse 2]
And Love, has died in song
Carried down by ancient tongues
Ferried around the water's thrum
And winds, along a line
Along a whirl, a lonely girl

To be, to see, to sweat, and bleed
To fall on your sword-on your sword
On your word

[Chorus]
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

[Verse 3]
Be still, by my side
For you are not my Clementine
And I am not your diamond's eye
To Sleep!

By right of you, I can't endure
In the light of things, I can't ignore
In spite of all the rose's thorns, and hopeless words, and hopeless works

[Chorus]
We're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers
And angels

Curse the ages, time spent on this earth
All False hopes, since the day of my birth
Curse the reasons, what should and shouldn't be
And all that is divine, the one who's cursed is me
Stubborn, like a mountain side
In you, I won't confide
Knock down, merits you earn
Cast out, lazy will to learn
Imprisoned, like brain to skull
Implode, no self control
Never see, pitfalls under feet
Won't accept, the goodness cursed on thee
Curse the patterns, showing cause for alarm
And the souls, that have always done me harm
Curse conditions, that molded minds this way
The cries and screams, unheard for another day
Why search for things untrue
Only one cursed is wretched you
Cursing others, and placing blame
You're the one, who lives in shame
Won't Stand up, and get in line
Narrow Minded for the asinine
Your self army, is only one strong
Lonely life, for you is too long
Stubborn, like a mountain side
In you, I won't confide

My brain is tortured all day long
The phone, the screen, more unknowns
The boss is lost in senseless time
He says my worth
Is measured in kind

Job is over, it’s time to run
Find that bud and have some fun
I’m lost in endless time
To save myself or live a lie

Black night, black night
Black night…

She walked up to my door
Knocked on the window
And asked for more
The drugs really turned her on
But the AIDS tore me down

She tried to trade her best gift
I tried to fight but fell into the pit
Now I’m trapped within my mind
To help myself or go and die

Black night, black night
Black night…

Late at night more chaos comes
I’m just too stupid and I won’t run
Now my friends, try to hail
While I sit in hell and rot in jail

Ti è mancata la speranza, la forza l'uguaglianza
Dei contadini curvi sulla terra
Ti è mancata l'innocenza, la perseveranza
Di un raccolto andato a male a primavera

Ti è mancata una patria e un po' di appartenenza
Il sentire delle tue radici
Forse il senso del dovere, oltre a quello del piacere
Un po' di sale e di maturità

Quanti mondi, quante storie quante le combinazioni
Che arrendersi è storia da vigliacchi
Tanto la vita ti darà lenzuola bianche e pane caldo
E a me la polvere delle strade

Ti è mancata una famiglia a cui voler davvero bene
E una casa da non disprezzare
Quando fuori farà freddo e pioverà davvero forte
In quale letto ti andrai a riscaldare

E poi tu non pensare
Che sia tutto qui
Quanti orizzonti non abbiamo avuto modo di guardare e poi
Non restano che le canzoni
Specchi nei ricordi
Per il giorno che vorrai andare via

Tutto passa e tutto cambia è così facile a capirsi
Eppure ogni volta ci caschiamo
Bisognerebbe ritornare alla canzone popolare
Che suonava l'ora alle stagioni

Bisognerebbe visitare centomila cimiteri
E festeggiare la vita ogni sera
Come le grandi carovane degli zingari dell'est
Sotto la guerra, il vino e la miseria

Ma poi tu non pensare
Che resti tutto qui
Dentro queste stanze quante volte hai visto
Dove può arrivare un uomo
La musica e l'ideale
Schiusi negli sbagli, dietro ai muri
Che mi portano via da te

Che disastro amore mio era davvero necessario
Dare fuoco a tutta questa polveriera
Che disastro amore mio era davvero necessario
Trasformare questo cielo in galera
Ma ora aspettami ti prego non lasciarmi qui da solo
Tra tutte queste rovine
Io che ho visto tutto il vuoto di un andare senza scopo
Sopra strade senza inizio e senza fine

E poi ovunque andrai
Ricorda la poesia
Nasce dalla terra e fiorisce nei giardini di chi sa vedere
Dio dietro le cose
Brucia nelle piazze e nei sorrisi più segreti dell'umanità

Tremila anni di evoluzione
E non ho ancora una risposta
In fila senza un senso o una ragione
Ad aspettare una risposta
Tra chi non sa dove andare
Ma comunque di corsa ci va
Tremila notti sotto la tua porta
Magro di fede e grasso di illusioni

Tremila anni di sbagli e di dolori
E i roghi della Santa Inquisizione
Sui cingoli dei vostri carri armati
Menzogne, potere e repressione
Tra chi provava a cambiare
E chi lasciava tutto com’è
I giusti hanno un volto ed hanno un nome
E la Storia non ha mai pietà

Tremila anni di paura della notte
E bunker dentro le foreste
I boschi sempre dietro alle finestre
Tremila anni di grande civiltà
E ormai non ci sono più stelle
Nella nebbia delle nostre città
Abbiamo armi sempre più potenti
Tra galere che chiamiamo Libertà

Tremila anni d’evoluzione
Persi a cercare una risposta
Mi chiedo se sia stato un errore
Pretendere un’umanità migliore
Ma poi non mi resta che stare
Dalla parte di chi è come te
Buonanotte domani è un giorno buono
Per cercare la risposta che non c’è

Un sud antico coltivato a grano
Che senso ha dire che sono un italiano
Che senso ha dire che sono un italiano
Se le mie mani scavano da sempre
Un suolo aspro coltivato a grano

Madre e i tuoi occhi sul senso delle cose
Madre e le mura di queste quattro case
Che poi qualcuno comunque c'ha vissuta
è stata dura ma non ha mai ceduto
è stata dura e la terra è stata tutto
Se pregheremo darà pur qualche frutto

Madre col treno io me ne andrò lontano
Sarò soldato oppure carpentiere
E tornerò con qualche lira nella mano
E ne berremo fino a stare male
Che tutto questo dovrà pur finire
Che dovrà starci un modo per campare

Madre la terra è coltivata a grano
Quaggiù restare significa morire
Ma coi tuoi occhi amari come il fieno
Non mi hai mai detto al mondo come stare
E prenderò la via per la statale
E dopo la Puglia mi aspetterà il Molise
E forse a Roma troverò fortuna
E passerà pure la voglia di tornare

E sarò solo un punto nelle cose
E là nessuno saprà già il mio nome
Ne' quanto è stato dolce ma anche vano
Vivere i campi e coltivarli a grano

Questione di chilometri
Il cielo basso, le mani sudate
L'Italia ci scorreva dolcemente sotto ai piedi
Ai lati della strada

Questione di significato da attribuire alla parola ""libertà""
Che non significa non curarsi degli altri
Ma, anzi, donargli incondizionatamente
Tutto noi stessi

Stringi ancora i denti, ancora un poco di strada
E ti potrai riposare
Assieme a tutte le promesse fatte
Che non potevamo in nessun modo mantenere

Ho fame, ho sete di razionalità
Di dare un posto alle cose
Senza l'ombra del rimorso
Del passato o del futuro

E oramai non c'è più niente
Non c'è dolore e il cielo è un po' più blu
La strada qui davanti
Conduce nel profondo, verso Sud

Questione di chilometri
La terra secca, gli occhi riarsi
Il sole era una sfera di polvere
A picco sul deserto bruciato della mia evoluzione

Oggi ti chiamavo da una via Cavour
Di una qualche città di Marte
Più grande di te non ci sarà mai niente
E dopo sarà tutta un'altra poesia

Oggi che si festeggiano i funerali
Come gli zingari
E giorno dopo giorno
Io e te ci stiamo perdendo

E ormai non c'è più niente
Non c'è dolore e il vento è un po' più blu
La strada sotto al sole
Conduce nel profondo, verso Sud

Questione di chilometri
Mi avevi detto che saresti stata sempre
Che anche nei luoghi più desolati
Avrei saputo portarmi dietro una parte di te

Guardale ora queste belle parole
Che in fin dei conti sono come grano maturo
Pronte per essere colte
Ma troppo vaste da non riuscirle davvero ad amare

Oggi al tempio degli dei
Mi hanno offerto dei doni
Minerva, il cinico, l'anarchia e il denaro
Mi hanno promesso il meglio della loro felicità

Francamente non ho saputo cosa scegliere
È stato meglio tornarsene a Nord
In cerca di qualcuno con cui parlare

E ormai non c'è più niente
Non c'è dolore e il cielo è un po' più blu
La strada qui davanti
Conduce nel profondo, verso Sud

E il maggiore era l'unico
Ad avere le idee chiare
Quando ci disse ""questa mattina
C'è un lavoro da sbrigare""
E la pianura era così immensa
Che non vedevi più la fine
E il sole bruciava le nostre spalle
E dipingeva le colline

E il sole bruciava i nostri vent'anni
Rubati ai monti e rubati al mare
Messi su un treno una mattina
Per la leva militare
Ma perché mi hai fatto questo

Perché a morire per una bandiera
Non ci vai tu, ci vado io
Perché a morire per una bandiera
Non ci vai tu, ci vado io

Occupata dai militari

Annunciò il nostro arrivo
Che se eravamo 5000
Oggi non so chi è più vivo
Quel giorno eravamo 5000
E oggi non so chi è più vivo

Così il maggiore che era l'unico
Ad avere le idee chiare
Aveva occhi di deserto
Sotto al capello da ufficiale
Questa è una guerra e capirete
Che così girano le cose
Che come voi sull'altro fronte
Ci sono uomini senza pretese
Che come voi dall'altra parte
Non è più tempo di mani tese

Però una cosa signor maggiore
Quel giorno gliela dovevo dire
Che avevo ancora delle speranze
Volevo vivere e non morire
Che dietro la sua alta uniforme
Fresca di scuola militare
Ci sono uomini senza vergogna
Dietro alle leve del potere
Ci sono soldi che chiamano soldi
E poveracci da ingannare

E mentre marciavo sul mio destino
Con la morte nelle vene
Pensavo a lei sull'appennino
E alle sue mani fatte di neve
T'avrei amato per una vita
T'avrei dato tutto me stesso
Ora che mancano pochi momenti
Oggi si muore, si muore adesso

Avrei creduto che fosse più semplice
Dimenticare
Invece di odiare

La contessa dondolava lenta
Persa nell'oscurità
Aveva occhi forti come il vento
E triste non sembrava mai
E triste non sembrava mai

Presa all'angolo della strada
Tra le alpi e le praterie
Dentro a boschi troppi scuri
Lungo troppe ferrovie
Lungo troppe ferrovie

Nella notte del tuo tempo
Gli occhi aperti sulle cose
Per vedere più lontano
Della tua semplicità
Della tua semplicità

La contessa dondolava il cielo
Con le sue spighe di grano
Chissà adesso dove sei
Se t'hanno poi capita mai
Se t'hanno poi capita mai

Nella storia che non ama imperatori
Si rimpasta il vecchio gioco del potere
E mi ricordo di altre bandiere
Altri slogan, altre facce ed altre idee

Sulle strade che entrano a Praga
C’è il trionfo della repressione
Sui carri armati dell’armata rossa
C’è una maschera di un altro colore
C’è chi maschera un altro colore

Sulla piana che solca l’Ungheria
Corre il treno di questa mia vita
Ma tu mi dici che è già finita
E non sai che dolore mi dai
Tu non sai il dolore che mi dai

Tu che mi dici: lascia stare
Sai che il tempo è un amico infedele
E come vedi, tutto cambia
E l’amore è fatto solo di poesia
E l’amore è fatto solo di poesia

Le mani sempre più tese
E gli occhi schiusi fin dentro un’ideale
E il vento sui nostri ricordi
Sulle promesse
Sulle certezze
Sulle speranze
Di questo sogno che chiamiamo libertà

Per la gloria dei moderni dittatori
Scorre il sangue di un popolo sovrano
E tu soldato americano
Con che pane questa sera mangerai
Di chi è il pane che stasera mangerai

Sui tamburi della propaganda
Il regime immola i suoi ideali
Tanto una bomba quando esplode
Fa gli uomini davvero tutti uguali
Fa gli uomini davvero tutti uguali

E in TV si accendono i roghi
Per il fiore della mia generazione
Ti ho aspettata una vita
Ma tu dov’eri sorella utopia?
Ma tu dov’eri sorella utopia?
Ma tu dov’eri sorella utopia?
Ma tu dov’eri sorella anarchia?

Le mani sempre più tese
E gli occhi schiusi fin dentro un’ideale
E il vento sui nostri ricordi
Sulle promesse
Sulle certezze
Sulle speranze
Di questo sogno che chiamiamo libertà

Dimenticami
Ma lasciati dentro qualcosa
Un chicco di grano abbastanza maturo
Da attendere la pioggia serena
Della prossima estate

Anni fa
Sotto questo medisimo cielo
Dentro a questi occhi traditi
Che poi
In fin dei conti, adesso sai dirmi
Che cosa ne rimane

Dimenticaci
Le stazioni passate
Hanno perso colore, nel solco degli anni
Un ricordo è sempre più fragile
Di una speranza

Settembre ti odio
Sei caldo di giorno, freddo di notte
L'estate è finita
Tra le mie dita
E tu con lei

L'Irlanda
Degli occhi più verdi
Dei giorni migliori
Che senza rispetto, che senza pietà
Fuggono via

L'Italia
Ladri e cemento
Palazzi e buffoni
La guerra, la pace, l'oblio
E l'omertà

Dimenticati
Che niente era scritto
Che niente era detto
Che forse bastava sedersi, parlarsi
E ascoltarsi di più

Settembre ti odio
Sei caldo di giorno, freddo di notte
L'estate è finita
Tra le mie dita
Lei con te

Anni e anni di risacca
E una terra sola
Vecchi turchi, ungheresi
E padroni veneziani

Anni ed anni di rimorsi
Di dolori senza tempo
Canto il canto della faida
Di un paese alla deriva

I mortai sulle colline
M li ricordo bene
E le stragi nei mercati
I cecchini e le catene

Terra dolce terra amara
Io ti conosco ormai
Canto il sale della faida
Che ha un sapore che non sai

Lei non sa la verità
Mentre il suo paese muore
Cerca un po' di dignità
In un'alba senza sole

Mostar a starigrado aveva un ponte
E non l'ha più

Anni ed anni di promesse
Di trattati e nazioni unite
Carri armati nelle strade
E le menzogne sulle macerie

Terra dolce terra amara
Io ti conosco orm
Canto il sale della faida
Che ha un sapore che non sai

Dignità libertà
Sono a salve le mie parole
Stringi ancora l'umanità
O l'hai perduta nelle tue sere?
Dimmi: vedi ancora l'acqua scura
O non l'hai più?

Voi con i vostri caschi lucidi
Della polvere delle strade e del dolore dei vostri fratelli
Voi, cani da guardia delle guardie
Riflessi nello specchio, in equilibrio quasi perfetto

Mi avete preso alle spalle
E non potuto far altro che gridare
Tutto questo odio, pensavo
Non porterà certo a nient'altro di buono

Io e te infatti e da mesi che ormai non ci guardiamo più in faccia
Nel sole asciutto del nostro futuro
Di una giornata, in fin dei conti, potenzialmente tranquilla

Genova
Genova
Genova

Voi e i vostri palazzi d'oro
Colazioni di lavoro
E nel vento l'incombenza
Di un colpo di stato

Voi e le vostre piazze fiorite
Di una democrazia da carro armato
Di ordini e gemoetrie
Da nazismo in prima serata

Verso le tre del pomeriggio
Avevate bisogno di nuovi ordini, nuove divise e nuovi ideali
Perché quelli vecchi erano lordi
Del sangue della gente, del sangue dei vostri fratelli

Le mani sugli occhi ma il cuore sempre da una parte sola
E tu che piangi mentre dici ""ma non vedi, non lo vedono
Che così li ammazzeranno?""

Genova
Genova
Genova

E poi tutto è finito, tutto passa
Tra le commedie in nome del bene
Tra chi è uscito pulito
E chi è uscito in catene

E tu mi dici ""hai occhi uguali ai loro
Mentre insulti i tuoi migliori amici""
Hai ragione, dio quanto mi vergogno
Dio quanto mi vergogno

E adesso davvero non sento più niente
Tutto è passato
Tutto quanto è così lontano

L'estate scivolava
Giorno dopo giorno
Come una condanna
Tra andata e ritorno
L'immensa galera
Splendeva tutta intorno
Sulle strade del nostro mezzogiorno

E il tempo in certe sere
Si contava in distanze
E sulla 106 la ferrovia era parallela
Andava verso il nulla
E dal nulla proveniva
E le ore mi facevano più grande

Sullo stretto di messina
Consigliai a salvatore
Di piangere convinto
Solo se qualcosa muore
Mi chiese ""come stai""?
Gli dissi ""lascia stare
Ho il cuore a pezzi e certe volte vorrei morire""

Passavano i chilometri
E la sete di capirli
Nelle lettere d'agosto
Nei pomeriggi in cui non parli
E furono 100, 1000 e poi 2000
E alla fine smisi di contarli

Smisi di cercare
Un senso nelle cose
Nel sole che moriva
Dietro il filo delle case
Il senso è tutto intorno
È tutto un divenire
Davvero non c'è niente da capire

Taranto, Palermo
Lecce, Barcellona
La piana dei Torlonia
Di Brindisi o Matera
Davvero non pensavo
Che tanta desolazione
Potesse amarmi e scendermi nel cuore

E giù per le statali
L'italia quella vera
L'italia dei più furbi
Coltivata a miseria
L'italia dei padroni
Dei poveri in catene
L'italia che parlarne non conviene

Mi dissero quaggiù
Non cambierà mai niente
I migliori prima o poi
Finiscono su un treno
E se ne vanno a Roma, in America o a Torino
E ritornano per la festa del patrono

Gli scioperi, le armi
Le cattedrali nel deserto
Lo stato dei collusi
E quello degli amici
Ed ecco la tua italia, divisa e fatta a pezzi
Giuseppe, eri solo un idealista

Taranto, Palermo
Lecce, Barcellona
La piana dei Torlonia
Di Brindisi o Matera
Davvero non pensavo
Che tanta desolazione
Potesse amarmi e scendermi nel cuore

Chiusi un poco gli occhi
Oltre le apparenze
E scelsi di capire
E di non giudicare
Chi giudica ha giù preso la strada per tornare

Io, invece, non sapevo dove andare

Galway porto di mare
E un libro di Herman Hesse
Riso e un bicchiere di Thè
Birra al molo se avrò due soldi

L'Irlanda è tutta qua fuori
Che pascola nel blu
Scende dalle sue valli
Tra l'oceano e la brughiera

Ho messo le gambe nel cuore
E le ho portate via
Ai lati delle nazionali
Le ho portate via
E il vento andava più forte
Le mani stringevano il cielo
E tutto sembrava più vivo
L'inganno diviso dal vero

Le lettere scritte sul molo
Che mai leggerai
Gli scogli, l'oceano, la terra
E vecchi felici
E il cielo era vasto oltre il monte
E tutto poteva accadere
Ed anche il dolore si arrese
Di fronte al sorriso di Dio

Sul ciglio delle scogliere
Scolpite a poesia
Il senso più vero e immortale
Di una nazione
E niente potrà mai spiegare
La forza di quelle pianure
Il suono di certi violini
Il mare che urlava negli occhi

Che perso ero perso nel fondo
Dell'Irlanda occidentale
E un viaggio non è mai spostarsi
Ma è un atto d'amore
Tra te e la terra che incontri
Tra te e la tua parte migliore
Figlia di quello che hai dentro
Sposa della libertà

Ho messo le gambe nel cuore
E l'ho portato via

30027,

In un giorno di sole più caldo
Il mio amore se ne volerà
Arrendendosi alla sua sorte
Il mio amore se ne volerà

Lascerà questo vecchio occidente
Poi l'oceano le si aprirà
Tra le lacrime delle radici
E la sete di libertà

E stasera hai gli occhi più tristi
Sulla strada per la frontiera
Perché tanta ingiustizia nel mondo
Proprio oltre questa frontiera

Vorrei fare di più la mia parte
Mi dicesti in un giorno lontano
E tra gli ultimi del nostro tempo
Saldare i miei conti con l'uomo

Per trovare la mia direzione
Sulla strada che porta a quel dio
Che è negli occhi di tutti i fratelli
Nelle viscere delle città

Prenderai la tua valigia
Con dentro qualcosa di noi
Che ti possa far forza la notte
Nella notte dei sogni più tuoi

Prenderai la via del cielo
Con un chicco di buona fortuna
Da piantare tra chi non ne ha avuta
E ad un fiore darai il nome mio

In un giorno di sole più caldo
Il mio amore ritornerà
Sarà forte forte come una donna
Bella come la verità

Sarà forte forte come una donna
Bella come la verità

Avrei mai potuto amare una ragazza
Che almeno una volta nella vita
Non avesse sognato d'essere
Amelie Poulain?

E Parigi scorre lenta
Mi chiedi se ho dei sogni da levarmi dalle scarpe
E un sorriso ti si ferma tra la fronte ed il volto
Tu che potresti pure essere nata qua
Tanto Parigi non lo sa

I turchi, i tunisini e gli indiani
I russi, i polacchi e gli italiani
Qualcuno ha lasciato i cannoni a Montmartre
Con l'esercito proprio fuori la città

E i treni vanno veloci
Sui vapori dell'ideologia
In enormi stazioni in ferrovetro
Che quando parti non torni più indietro

Le piazze i mercati le case
La gente che passa e va via
Gli studenti e la polizia
E le battaglie di duecento
Di duecento anni fa

Avrei mai potuto amare una ragazza
Che non avesse qualche cosa di rosso
Un sorriso o un sogno nascosto
Da regalare solo a chi dice lei

E Roma è bella di Maggio
Con l'ombra degli olmi sulle case
Però c'è voluto coraggio
Non ti dissi le solite scuse

E allora ti porto a vedere
I binari della ferrovia
Tra questi discorsi a vapore
Tra chi vive con un po' di poesia

Le strade, i palazzi, le chiese
La gente che passa e va via
Dicevi che qui c'ero nato
Su quest'isola della città mia

Avrei mai potuto amare una ragazza
Che almeno una volta nella vita
Non avesse sognato d'essere
Amelie Poulain?

Venti giorni di fuga
La pioggia lavava i ricordi
Ho gli occhi più scuri
Ma nessuno sembra essersene accorto

Sarà che non ci sei
E che saresti stata tu
A capire come sto
Senza farmi una domanda
Così simile a me
Ma poi così distante

Ero così lontano
Il vento spazzava la strada
Giù nelle pianure
Che mai saprò raccontarti

Chissà se capirai
Come stavo certi giorni
Da solo nel mio letto
Di grano e di cemento
Le volte in cui ho urlato
E tu non c'eri

Però se tornerò
Ti porterò una canzone
Qualcosa che ho trovato
Sul ciglio della vita
E tu ti stupirai
Di trovarci cose nuove

Venti giorni di sole
A picco, senza pudore
Ho il volto bruciato
E dentro non sai che dolore

Non sai quanta rabbia
Quando a volte acceleravo
Per perdermi più in fretta
Tra le braccia della terra
Da solo nell'immenso
Da solo nell'immenso

30032,"

Dio, è così tanto tempo
Che non scrivevo pensando a te
Certe volte avrei anche voluto, ma credimi
Il coraggio mi è rimasto nel cuore

T'avrei scritto soltanto banalità
Senza riuscire a tenerti per mano
Rimpicciolendo al ricordo dolcissimo
Del giorno assoluto in cui andammo lontano

Perché vedi esistono sguardi
Che non si possono dire con gli occhi
E ci sono silenzi talmente assordanti
Che in certe sere non li riesci a cantare

E le solitudini più profonde di un uomo
Affiorano appena sulle linee di un volto
E ci vuole tanto di quell'amore
Per capire che il tempo ci ha dato e ci ha tolto

Per capire che in fondo tutto è cambiato
E sono anch'io diventato banale
T'ho scritto canzoni che già ti aspettavo
Che se non scrivevo, in fondo, era uguale

Ma per comprendere un atto d'amore
Per non ritrovarsi a buttarlo via
Bisogna essere un poco poeti
Rifletti su questo anima mia

Ma cosa resta del nostro tempo?
Di tutti gli sforzi fatti per cambiare
Che cosa mi rimane delle tue mani?
Del nostro urgentissimo bisogno di amare

E gli occhi non erano che roghi immensi
Tu che credevi non avremmo mai spento
Poi tutto a un tratto la sola compagna
Rimase la strada ed un filo di vento

Blood is flooding my vision
The crash of metal suffocates my hearing
I'm loosing myself
I feel like a dead man
All this biomechanics bypasses my brain
The cement of our survival
Crumbles as if a second lasted a century
Our beloved world is collapsing in front of us
Driving Edaenia's fell
I feel like a dead man
All this biomechanics bypasses my brain
With a child's purity
With the strength of ten armies: Saviour, you were our chalice
Why did you decide to take us on
My faith in you was blind
Work was guiding the reconstruction, if only...
You hadn't been held hostage
By OM's legion, that's a lie
Total Slander!! Men's exploitation won't exist in twenty fifth century
There were no weapons
You tell us to make some
To faith
Your answer is madness
With a child's purity
With the strength of ten armies: Saviour, you were our chalice
Why did you decide to drive us to death
With a child's purity
With the strength of ten armies: Saviour, you were our chalice
Why did you decide who your murderers should be
My faith in you was blind
Work was guiding the reconstruction, if only...
A nation's symbol
I crush with my own hands the seeings that created you
Non humans, fear our sadism
I have nothing left to lose
Brutal rage, my entire being will unleash anathema
No burden will be heavier to carry
Than not to kill our executioner
My tears are for you, Almighty
I set intoxicated on destroying you
Wiped out and disincarnated
Your testament delivers your will of non-existence
Mistake, you're but a mistake
You're asking me to correct it, makes me edgy
Every trick against your machine
Make my neurons implode, make my soul die

"
31253,"

Let me rest in peace
I'm nothing, I can't teach anyone a lesson anymore
My cells want to stay inert
Why do you keep approaching me
My neurons are so old
I won't be men's clown anymore
My nerves have became numb
I don't dictate laws, I am the law
Stay united instead. Are we there to regulate men's deviancies?
I can't believe in this meaningless cause leading to no salvation
Watch our laws stirring up again a taste for life and desire
I can't imagine our lines are drowning our kindred
My target isn't mankind. Evils are deeper. Fight obsequium minaris
The spark of hope that stays in me will blow up the whole system
The game we're in is simple: men's exploitation
One feeling is driving me: vengeance!!
Stay united instead. Are we there to regulate men's deviancies?
I can't believe in this meaningless cause leading to no salvation
Watch our laws stirring up again a taste for life and desire
I can't imagine our lines are drowning our kindred
I'm Adam, the non-human eraser
I'm re-establishing money game and sex
And creating anarchy in my Edaenia
I'm Adam the purifier of humans
I break the chains of those who want to fight
And give their lives for liberty
Everyone will have to kill a minarian and anyone running off!
Everyone will write their own story through the others
Blood will squirt again
Guts will be your fetishes
Bones will break, bones will smash in slimy marrowshed
Your bulging eyes, your scarification, will flow in with hate
Stay united instead. Are we there to regulate men's deviancies?
I can't believe in this meaningless cause leading to no salvation
Watch our laws stirring up again a taste for life and desire
I can't imagine our lines are drowning our kindred
Your skin, dry and rough as leather, I burn it!

"
31254,"

Participating in my city's life is the point of my enrichment
Every day you make, seal my devotion morestrongly
Taking the tools of reconstruction is binding me to my fellows
Everything I do signs further my worship for you Adam
I wake up every morning claiming our salvation
The one you handed down to us
I kneel down every night to celebrate your coming
The one which has freed us
My name is Gorith, mainstay of the city, I drill the ground
My hands are working to extend life's lanes
I don't see the light, frozen are my eyes and blind is my mind
There's no place for tiredness when I must hear Adam's voice
Expiate our misdeeds
Mortify the past
A new day is coming
And it is to better serve us that you are arising at last
My name is Silva, messenger of the city, I transfer orders
My voice rises to enforce community's rules
I can't sleep anymore, my thoughts are divided, I' near madness
And it's to fight my wandering, that I keep moving
Expiate our misdeeds
Mortify the past
A new day is coming
And it is to better serve us that you are arising at last
Every day I wake up to scream my hunger
The one that stabs deep inside me
I kneel down every night to praise the feast
The one that feeds our souls
Expiate our troubles
Mortify the past
A new day is coming
And it is to better serve us that you are arising at last

Spread your soul into futile religions
Folklore of your existence
Your customs dash
Your perception of reality

Rejoin mathematics cult of science...
Your knowledge of the universe
Has sealed men's destiny
Their need to be awake

Drench your thirst with ancestral beliefs
Masquerade which dupes you
Your reality's only a distorted view
Confront the truth of research...

Disavow, give up, escape, shun
Your pledges full of lies

Extol, hallow your prophet's views
Endure in your flesh
Don't you realize your God is lying?
Fill your spirit with statement of your priests
Flog your mind
Don't you feel, you too, the need to create?

Learn, decipher, look for, solve
The riddles of your life

Stifle your mind with the weight of rules
Ceremonies of your days
Your rites castrate
Your ability to create
Take part in progress's conquest...
The technology which is yours
Would you know, how could you
Manage without it today

Disavow, give up, escape, shun
Your pledges full of lies

Disavow, give up, escape
Shun your pledges full of lies

Learn, decipher, look for
Solve the riddles of your life

Feed your spirit with ludicrous curses...
Gruesome dance that tricks you
Your heart is beating on a rhythm
That is not yours
Become the prodigy of your time
The genius of some has sealed
The destiny of all
To understand

Disavow, give up, escape, shun
Your pledges full of lies

With suffering but alive, I'm running through decimated bodies
Gapping, suppurated, oozing, are the wounds of my blood brothers
Through blood for freedom, I rise up against these dictators
Vindicative, oppressive, menaching, is the yoke of these warmasters

Participate in the symphony of destruction, kill to survive
Remember how thin life is on earth
Defend the sovereign laws of your country, brutalize to dominate
Remember how scarce air is on earth

My eyes low so my hat down)

Verse 1:
I come from that north side of that Jacktown
My eyes low so my hat down
Bad Bitch on my cell phone

Black pack of them white owls

But I swear im no mason tho
This shit is amazing tho
Tellem something they should kno

But im just Sick of being patient tho
Paitents is a virtue
But im virtually impaitent ho

I swear to God I been missin you

I told her closed mouths don't get fed
She made her tongue play peek a boo
Another shout for my nigga Taz
Swear to God that he a creature too

I told once before that I was a beast
They fucked around and they let me loose

Roda rodant neo ruta destroy inna dancefloor
Unta'm de crema!

Ni un nano ni nono
Mo n'anem
Last night half past eight

Pobles i festa
Descontrol ruïna
Mandanga en el tanga
Burumballa en tarima
Cata cubata bakalata primera fila
Resaca playa peim aspirina
Adrenalina dilah
Canela en rima
Albaes, processons
Serotonina
Aspenta teta, horitzontal te tenta
L'abocaor d'El Puig te representa
Bovina, ovina, porcina en la granja
Palmera discotequera i més ganja
Gasteu bé l'eina
Anem per feina
Nanai de la xaina
Nonaina
Nanai nonà

Festa fluorescent de les llums intermitents
Bombo caixa i Benima no ens falla
La gent del bodevil untant de crema la nit
Carrers i falles trutupà i tralla

Roda rodant neo ruta destroy inna dancefloor
Unta'm de crema!

Hui n'hi ha torrà papi
I la matinà és pa mi
Hàmers ocasions racons revolcons
Carretera Barna rotondes detencions
Túning competicions a rectes de polígons
Espòilers i alerons a l'aire
Semàforos en ambre
Clits per estrenar estrenant fetge
Make up funda güihqui fanta i de banda a banda
Rulen i merquen una nova tanda
Benefici hasla carril bici pasta
Milhomes panda al regne del vici
Farem negoci alternatives a l'oci
Oh sí sí mulata oh sí sí

Festa fluorescent de les llums intermitents

Tu quieres que yo te diga que sí sí sí
Pero yo te digo que no no no
Se te pasó el arroz con este MC
Vas a tragarte mi microfono

Negra és la sang que corre dins d'aquesta terra
Sota els peus de gent amb un futur ben negre
Com el cor d'aquells que els hi han portat la guerra
Navegant des de molt lluny... No!!!

Sents el vent xiular? Sents la mort ballar?
Bales que venen i van. Uh, Ah!!!
Són la solució, són la salvació
I sempre desinteressats. Uh, Ah!!!
Volen llibertat i felicitat. venen les seves veritats
Són la solució, són la salvació
I sempre desinteressats

¿Sabes lo que pasa cuando pones gasolina?
¿Qué pasa?, ¿qué pasa?

Un burro per la bassa!

Freda, és la veu que ens va parlant a cau d'orella
I que ens diu que hem de ser ràpids, anar depressa
Donem de menjar a motors que ens destrueixen
Per fer rics als assassins... No!!!

Sents el vent xiular? Sents la mort ballar?
El dipòsit a vessar. Uh, Ah!!!
Són la solució, són la salvació
Ho tenen tot tant controlat... Uh, Ah!!!
Volem llibertat i felicitat
Fer-se ric és prioritat. Uh, Ah!!!
Són la solució, són la salvació
Ho tenen tot tant controlat...

""Veniu amb mi, us porto la felicitat
Velocitat, rapidesa, efectivitat...
I no patiu que això no s'acabarà
Ara també puc cremar-vos cereals.""

Hem de dir prou, tot això està a punt de petar
Un núvol fosc t'entra dins al respirar
L'ànima trista d'algú que ja no està...
Que ecara està plorant

¿Sabes lo que pasa cuando pones gasolina?

Ginger on your head
Threw my coat
No more I drink just spicy pink
Spicy pink soup
I love you
For hiking through the grainy parts of New York
But I vanished appeared on an island
Ginger kids can be nothing but violent

[Bridge]
Race bikes, at night
I hope we don't crash into any street lights

[Verse 2]
Expensive smoke and lacking in
The life of the ginger kids
And ginger kids all love to get lost in the earth
In the earth

[Verse 3]
Lady make up your mind
What the rose or the gold
Baby pink little birds begin to unfold
Stick them on my shirt
And stick them on my nose
Wear them to the kingdom of the gold and the rose

I love you

[Verse 1]
Those looks have closed me in your palm
Sent me dreaming softly between
But I won't stay where I dream for long
Through your rising in the morning
Then you're settling 'round the evening
And when you come back home
When you come back home
I won't ever let go
I have't before

[Bridge]
Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo

[Verse 2]
Dressed in wine-stained silk
Hanging you're eyes, widened too
Somewhere above the window's reach
Steps, soft, in a little room

[Outro]
We can glide back home
We can glide back home

I'm not breathing
Without machine

Lately
My heart's been breaking
My heart's been breaking
Through the seam

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Shut me off, shut me up
Shut me off, shut me up
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

"

Suddenly seeming
These eggshell ribs
Are caving into your hands
Can't sustain this breathing
It weighs on my chest
These lungs are filled with water from the tide
From the tide
And I watch them go by

Can't define a purpose
Though hands set adrift
In eyelids, cobwebs forming
Realize through the vapor
Some strange trembling gift
In sleep, I dream of houses in the sky
In the sky
And I watch them go by

Sometimes I'm pulled away
From my own misery
Your hands cover me
Eyes drift slowly

Sleep the summer chill
In sheets of linen
Hush the static sound
Of time dispersing

Sometimes I'm pulled away
From my own misery
Your hands cover me
Eyes drift slowly

Sleep the summer chill
In sheets of linen
Hush the static sound
Of time dispersing

Where do they go in time?
Do you think that they will die?
They're on that time-line
Oh, i miss him today
I'm standing inside the gate
With someone re-incarnated-
Nathan, he's 18 again
I'm hurtling past time
Or is that even possible?
Who's writing it?
It's just a detail-
Nobody, everybody
I'm standing inside the gate
It was that younger face
It was that same face
It was that egyptian face
Do you die?
Die on that time-line?
I wanna thank everyone who put me here
They're in here
I'm coming back again
I'm moving past, through the past
I'm going back there
How can i meet you sideways in time?
It's happening
Or it's not happening
Or i'm dying on my feet
I'm coming back for me
Again

She is fine-
Rolling the lane and wasting the day
About Love and daylight
Walking away in the sun and the shade
Gonna dance- hey la
Water the leaves, looking over the trees
Gonna be alright
But what would my lady say?
Give her an ounce of pay
Loose her mind, all that time
What do we love to do?
Run through the park and trip in the dark
And dig up our roots
And just move to delay an average day
Well then I agree
Part of me wakes with something to take
But then magically it fades
So what are we going to do?
There's nothing to do but walk in my shoes
And dust the land
Down on my knees I confess to the breeze-
The best time I ever had
And I'm sane, Jane

Put a hole in the ground just to bury your poor uncle
Put that shovel down for he's nearin' toward his savior
If his heart's light as a feather he can walk right in
It's a shame it's heavier by the burdens of his sins
Oh me, what have I done?
Oh me, what have I done?

Have a paper son, you can light yourself a cigarette
He'll shine up his gun with the corner of my wedding dress
Never shoot at moving things, just feels good in my hand
Makes me feel more threatening, makes me feel like a man
Oh me, what have I done?
Oh me, what have I done?

Now God sees everything, but does he have himself an x-ray
To see him lie to me? The stink of gin and whiskey
We've been known to holler but I love that boy to death
Lipstick on his collar and some whiskey on his breath
Thought I saw clear waters, storm was slow to rest
He had lipstick on his collar and a bullet in his chest
Oh me, what have I done?
Oh me, what have I done?

I'm just a nobody because nobody smiles at me
You must be somebody cause your friends sell smiles for free
I wish you were lonely cause maybe I wouldn't be
You'd feel so sorry for that other nobody

And who needs friends when you can come and cry with me?
It all depends when your cup is half full or half empty
Who needs friends when you can come and cry with me?
It all depends when your cup is half full or half empty

I'm just a nobody, I like to write and read
You must be somebody cause you never talk to me
I wish you were ugly cause I would feel so free
To hold hands and sing with that other nobody

And who needs friends when you can write bad poetry?
Talk of when love ends, the hurt sets in, the faithful art of the lonely
Who needs friends when you can write bad poetry?
Talk of when love ends, the hurt sets in, the faithful art of the lonely

I'm just a nobody, I call my own phone
You must be somebody cause I've never seen you alone
I wish you weren't so huggable when I feel like a cactus tree
Who wants to touch the thorns of a hopeless nobody?

In the belly of the beast and out the blow-hole
To the salty sea, she's a seagull boat
Floating like a dead man all the dead tend to float

And her ghost came in like a silent thief
Heard the drop of a pin, stole my beard of bees
And there's no ugly buzzing for the keeper to keep

Oh lo in the distance the stallion comes
And they call him Lightning for his hind-legged run
Boxing his hooves at the dampening dawn

Come, let Lightning strike me down
I'm ready as I'll ever be right now
But we can't understand her with her teeth out her mouth

She said ""Come, let Lightning strike me down
I'm ready as I'll ever be right now,""
At the sound of applause, she took a swooping bow

We put heavy coins on her eyelids
And we clothed her fast softening breast
And her children were five flaming arrows
And her ashes were solemnly left

To the wind, down to Puerto Rico
Where her father stood silent, she laughed
Looking down at her firm, able body
And he pulled her now close to his chest

He said ""I know each love is a lifetime
My darling, I loved you my best
Please don't cry child, it's been such a long time
You look like the day that I left
I left, I left, I left, I left""

So come, let Lightning strike me down
I'm ready as I'll ever be right now
In the belly of the beast and out the blow-hole, Lord

It was painted black and white
Like some shivering little pup
Inside a coffee cup

Stay here, stay here for a while
You can lay me, you can lay me down
I think we've figured something out
If only for a little while

The frog did slowly die
When it became cracked and dry
In the air conditioner
Behind the convenience store

You're water, you're water, you're air now
And I'm not sure I'll be okay
If I cannot breathe, cannot drink you
I won't last a day-- please

Is there another lover there in your room, does he even know about me?
Can there be any doubt that from here on out
This debris, it's all that's left of me

When you look down deep into the pit of my heart can you find the weakest link
With your low little reef and your broken teeth I ain't never gonna be your friend
Is there another lover there in your room, does he even know about me?
And can there be any doubt that from here on out

You would tear it apart just to prove that you're smart, you would burn me down

I just wanted to touch you
I didn't mean to break you
This is how it feels
When everything goes wrong
Love won't leave you a song

Once you kissed me sweetly
Now you won't even greet me
On a crowded street
And all my days seem long
Now that all your love is gone

And no blue melody
Could ever please me
No chorus or refrain
Could take away the pain

I won't be here tomorrow
There's no time left to borrow
That's just how it feels

It won't leave a song

And the damage is done
And you shield my eyes while you suck me dry like a rattle snake does
Reptile style
You brought me poison apples on a silver tray
Reptile style
Well you broke my heart and you slit it away

You said finding good help is hard
Then you handed me a business card
That said all good things must pass
And the adress just said in the grass
Then you slid you hand into my shirt
Said carefull you might get hurt
When the whole clouds turn to green with envy
As you sank your teeth right in me

You brought me poison apples on a silver tray

Languid and lazy
Take me quickly
Fill me sickly
Naked I take it
Two lips and a paid debt
Returned and recurring
Laid and stirring
Spiral quickly
You can't see me
But I'm dropping fast
See I want it
See I want it
See I want it now
In peace thoughts fasten
Buckled and crass, then
Safely saunter
Silent wander
A fine degradation
Thick sedation
Pain dissipates
Sacred desecrates
Spiral quickly
You can't see me
But I'm dropping fast again
See I want it
See I want it
See I want it now
Spiral quickly
You can't see me

A picture of you, a smile and a bong
We’re laughing together and singing an old fashioned song
Then something went wrong

You pushed me into the pond,under the ice
What were you thinking? I’ve already been baptised
Now that wasn’t nice

Since you’ve been gone, I’ve been safe, I’ve been sound, I’ve been good
All those magical times that we shared are al tainted with mud
No good

You tied up my hands, and gave me a smile
Attached me to your car, and dragged me for miles and miles
I’ve got to say, you destroyed me in style
Such a deadly smile

Pain, fading away, healing with time
Pain, fading away, healing with time

Since you’ve been gone, I’ve been safe, I’ve been sound, I’ve been good
All those magical times that we shared are al tainted with mud
No good

Managed to see right through, ain't no scab left on this wound

Burned on her skin, ain't no man left in this room
Blind in one eye, but she could see right through you
Like a movie dream, can't escape the calling dead
Ain't no friendly dead, ain't no key left in this hand
Saw her in the sun, snarling beast he never seen
A beast he never seen, ain't no hope left in this room
Blind in one eye, but she could see through you

Sacrifice, for the city's sake you'll watch it incinerate
Sacrifice, takes a fire to wash away the human waste
Was it a crime? Was it a crime?

A disgrace, like a parasite. Dig it out to desecrate

Is it fault or fate that I can't relate, my mind's impurities have left me empty. Don't want to be detached but I'm fucking lost. In my head, the things I can't control. Slave to the eyes I see. The enemy never leaves my sight. It's never ending, it's always wrong. It's never easy, It's always wrong. There's a battle in my head I know I'll never solve. It's never ending. I'm lost in a world of people I ant to love but can't stand a minute in their gaze. Night brings no relief, solitude for me. Close my eyes and dream of a life I'll never have. Where does it leave me? Fucked up and disenchanted. It's never ending, it's always wrong. It's never easy, It's always wrong. There's a battle in my head I know I'll never solve. It's never ending. Where's the life I dreamed?

Scarred your young hands, now pick through the glass
Your plan went dead wrong, can't trick your way into love
This haze won't drift off, this night won't live on
It's a set up, it never let up, and it don't mean a thing
It's just a vow and a ring
Can't be everything to everyone, every time
Stop you're not getting any kind of answer here
Your plan went dead wrong, can't dig your way out of love
This curse won't move on, this scar won't scrape off
It's a set up, it never let up, won't ever stop until you're gone
Can't be everything to everyone, every time
Everything, everyone's gone

Grown tired of the false praise
Grown tired of trying to wait
Left last on the beggar's plate
(On, and on, and on)
These days it's assured to break
These days there's a sign to face
These days there's a role you fake
(On, and on, and on)
I've found there's a simple way
I've found how humility tastes
Struck cold I can never shake
(On, and on, and on)
These days it's assured to break
These days there's a sign to face
These days there's a role you fake
(On, and on, and on)
That time, it's gone. I never felt it at all
One day, I found it gone
The place we lost. I never saw it off
One day, it takes us all
I'm lost in Groningen
(On, and on, and on, and on, and on)

Another year drips down the drain and I'm sick from trying. One inch closer to the answers but I'm still the same. No love, no dream, no touch, no feeling, no hope for salvation. Puckered pigs as dignitaries fistfucked with money. Powersick parasitic fangs bared to feast. No pigs, no plea, no judge, no jury. No ego-powered delusion. I'm gone, I'm done this year has gone to my head. I need to find a safe place because I'm feeling lost in this world. I need to find a safe place. We're the casualty of apathy, eyes closed to everything. Safe at home in our indifference while the deaths keep rising. No god, no greed, no force, no freed, no military solution. Another term with nothing learned but disillusion and confusion. False reports from every front sustain American illusion. No change, no move, no truth, no news, no political revolution. I'm gone, I'm done this year has gone to my head. I need to find a safe place because I'm feeling lost in this world. I need to find a safe place

Oh what a shame
I let you invade my brain again
What did you see inside
A simple place to hide
Away from you
Now you're trapped here
Looks like the jokes on you
I've got the only key out
I'm not giving it to you
Where are your friends now
I'm the only one who can help you

The saddest part of this
Is the way that we kiss
It makes me feel right
Yeah,it makes me feel right
I look inside your eyes
To see where you hide
But you never let me in
No, you'll never let me in
Now I see that the joke is certainly on me
I'm stuck outside the only place that I wanna be
Oh what a sad reality

All I wanna do is feel
But sometimes, I feel too much
All I wanna do is love
But sometimes, I love too much
Do you wonder why some days
I say those things I say
It's you
Ever wonder why, oh why, would I act this way
It's you

All I wanna do is feel, but sometimes
I can't feel at all
All I wanna do is love, but sometimes
My love is gone
Well I'm a human too even if
It doesn't seem that way to you
I've got flesh and bones just like you

Well I'm a human too
Even if it doesn't seem that way to you
Well I'm a human too
Even if, even if
It doesn't seem that way to you
That way to you

Why don't you say something?
This silence is deafening
Putting a ringing in my ears
Maybe along the lines of, ""How are you?""

I never knew you could disappear
So well, and so for real
Where'd you learn a trick like that?
I'd like to learn when you get the chance

So next time I want to treat someone like shit
I can practice your disappearing trick
Along the lines of you
But this will never do
Until he knows that
All the words he wants to
Are all the words he's not supposed to say

Why don't you say something?
You're too busy, that's ok
I understand it's getting late
Tomorrow you have a busy day
And the day after that
And the day after that
And the day after that
You're busy too

But I wouldn't even know
Since my questions simply roll
Down the hill on which you lived
Before you just went and disappeared

So next time I want to treat someone like shit
I can practice your disappearing trick
Along the lines of you
But this will never do
Until he knows that
All the words he wants to
Are all the words he's not supposed to say

"
33035,"

I feel tired now
I wouldn't hold your breath 'til our next meeting
The way you depressed my chest
Whenever you crawled in from your secret evenings

There's always a paradox involved
Watch what you say to me
I'm not hungry for you to feed me a lie
There's always a way to mess things up
If you compose them without any real meaning

When the dusty summer air is right
I'll find the courage and realize
To erase you from my mind

You can't see the other side
But when it comes around
You'll see, it's nice

You'll erase her in due time

I should have woke up then
Instead of replaying scenes time and time again
But how can you once be, then never again
Without even fucking blinking?

I should have called the state
They'd take you away for much, much clearer reasons
Than those that were given to me
So you could take a cop handcuffed to the railing

At night when these troubled thoughts begin
You'll have to count then out of your mind
To erase her in due time
And because the wound there is so fresh
You'll pour and pour the iodine
Or else completely lose your mind

And all things end
I feel tired now

"
33036,"

I like that she has cats on her shoes
And a little tatoo
It says life in Polski
The city of Portland, it misses me

Can't it shift parallel to the coast
And fold three hundred miles?
To form the highest peak around
With a train that tunnels underneath

Of which I would ride
Of which I would ride

I like how she curls her head toward me
When she's falling asleep
But when eyes close the hours transpose
Into a thousand tiny seconds
They count down 'til the very end
When the ground settles home again
Before I depart for an apathetic north
We will say goodbye

Until next time
We wave goodbye

The very second
We cancel out the time
You will be waking
When I reach the other side
Beneath the surface
Of our north and south divided
Abbreviated
I wish we had more time

"
33038,
33039,"

All your abstract ideas
Exist in high atmosphere
Multiplied to anyone else
And your value disappears

Cause there's nothing inside
You were never occupied
Vacant eyes still unseen
As deep as a magazine

Do this math
Do this math

"
33040,
33041,"

I realize I must observe this
That I just can't expect to know when
You're right, I tend to overthink these things
At one thought per second, I just made my first mistake

So the mighty back has broken
And sooner than you might have thought then
I just want to settle down some
Not alot, just enough so I'm cozy and warm

It's too soon, yes I've observed this
When distance is a complication of choice
But every second of my travel to you
Is worth the time it takes, just to hear your voice

Far far away, will you stay, will you stay?

For once can't things just fall in place for me
Why must this intuitive sense invent
I'm trying not to parse your prose to death
When instinct wants to tell me half of what you meant

Far far away, will you stay, will you stay
If only just the weekend?

"
33042,"

Everyone knows we'll never make it
Too young to grow old
This is what it has to be

This place is so cold
My room is two by two
To save the rest of us few
This is what it has to be

But where do we go?
This way or that way?
A path of unknown
This is what is has to be

Soon

Show me where i must begin
Sign me up, sign me in

More than happy to fit in
Tie them up, tuck them in

Push the pedal to the floor
Do your worst, give me more

Bang my head against your wall
A broken face, a broken jaw

Soon

Introduction and farewell
Which is which, you can't tell

You whisper first, and then you yell
You told me that you couldn't tell

I know exactly what you mean
I know exactly what you mean

"
33043,
33044,"

No, it's not what you want
It's what you can't get
Soon I hope you'll realize
That the traffic still moves
While you sleep

While you sleep
While you sleep

No, it's not what you are
It's what you can't be
To be the bearer of bad news
I won't wait patiently
While you sleep

While you sleep
While you sleep

"
33045,"

I can't breath in all these things
Oxygen in my veins
Circulate to my brain
One way out, then back again

Later days
Later days

This place is so nice
With you here at my side
Gravestone framed city lights
The close of a year
Near the end of our time

Later days

"
33046,"

I could stare for hours
At your fast asleep face
Something keeps me warmer
Than your blanket self
Tonight

Stop pretending and breath
Or I'll put my hand up your sleeve
You return from slumber
To kiss me on the cheek

But I am only dreaming
And you've been gone for weeks

You are the very first one making out all over me
You set my nervous hands are(?)
So take me more
You'll take me

You were the first one
And i'd like to say

And i'd like you to stay

When i met your story love
Your lucid eyes came to life
Come on down to my depot
You tell me more and i'll tell you more

You were the first one
And i'd like to say
You were the first one
And i would like to say

Take is down
Down on the floor
It's piping hot
Let's move it more
Temperture is very cool
And i was sure
That i would feel like

Doesn't matter where you're looking
It doesn't matter who you're painting
Taking time to watch the walking
Taking time to take the train off
Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel
One, four, five when I'm walking
In the square, in the subway
Detroit, home is coming
Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel
Three, two, five when I'm walking
Yes, you were a lovely child
She is a lovely child
Gone diving in the river
But your body kept on swimming
All alone from life's beginning
Admiration is still swelling
Isabel comes to here

As you lay dying
Poppies are reddening
Bursting wide open, revealing their seeds
Tastes like the water that beads on white skin

As you lay dying
Morphine and ice cream
Staining your sheets, and confusing your mind
And it reminds me, they still get paid when you die

They took the heart right out of you

How did it feel to be twenty six degrees?
With your body split leaking all about your legs
Could you hear me call from your mountaintop
Crawling through the snow, crawling through the blood
To say, hey

Daddy
Daddy

How did it feel to be twenty six degrees?
With your body split leaking all about your legs

Don't go away

I do believe you're blushing
Everything in your mind is coming
Why, Miss J, I do believe you
I want to stick you gold and blue

Sucking boat where I want to be
Train, train in the ground with me
Sinking sky, the sky is falling
Looking now, I am calling you

I do believe your eyes
Your face is glowing
I do believe your face
Waking up to your eyes
Endless over
I do believe that you are blushing

Put me down on the ground, won't you?
Take a walk in the park, won't you?
Let's lay on the rock with me
Don't you, don't you, want to look me?

Push me to the wall, won't you?
Push a ring down my neck for you
What will they be like, like you?
Incredible eyes, incredible

I do believe your eyes
Your face is glowing
I do believe your face
Waking up to your eyes
Endless over
I do believe that you are blushing

You soft soap
The soft-shelled
The porous
Morons like me
And you're not sorry

Piece of cake
To shake off
Principles
Hard-won scruples
And pretty virtue

Crushed into the bottom
Of mud-yellow sand
Like a slippershell

Chrome
Like phosphorescent teeth
In mud-yellow skin
You're a slippershell
And you can go to hell

Hard water
Down your throat
Down your back
Hard to say it's hard luck
When you're so happy
Hard to say it's hard luck
When we had it coming

Crushed into the bottom
Of mud-yellow sand
Like a slippershell

Chrome
Like phosphorescent teeth
In mud-yellow skin
You're a slippershell
And you can go to hell
Maybe see me there

Can't you see it's a white-out
Made of chrome?
Can't you see the white-out?
It's why i piss and moan
It's why i can't go home

Wallet full of fat
Belly full of milk
You're touchingly, deeply fulfilled
You're very old
You're very new
You're touchingly, deeply confused

Can't you see the white-out?
No, i guess you don't

My lip gloss froze off
Outside the airport
On a hard bench
Beside a dingy Santa
I searched every face

What are you?
Animated soft tissue
Shifting neuropeptides
A social pyromaniac
A plate spinner

And it's smoky around you
I can hardly breathe

I watched your eyes go dark
I saw them look blank
I wasn't there
I saw it in pictures
After the fact

And it's smoky around you
I can hardly breathe

"
33535,"

Around dusk
You walk the seven blocks to paradise
And throw your arms around it
Part of the cattle call to harmony

At dawn it breaks
But much too late to wreck the night
We spun a silken effort
Wrapping the day in softer company

My favorite distant sadist
The acid test tangle
Face to face

Under the lights
Whatever it takes to kill me off
And throw your arms around me
Wrapping the night in ugly harmony

My favorite distant sadist
The acid test tangle
Face to face

I couldn't sleep anyway
The hole you left is full of rain

Morning birds screamed all night
If there was just a little light left
Something to grow into panic

Homeless
Coming home
I could not stop moving
Now i can't move
I miss you
I bet i take this lying down

You know it'd be a justified sin
You know it'd be a justified sin
You know it'd be clean

You know it'd be purifying
You know it'd be purifying
You know it'd be clean

Morning birds screamed all night
If there was just a little fright left
Something to grow into panic

Homeless
Coming home
I could not stop moving
Now i can't move
I miss you

33537,"

In the boiling grip of bad love
I was dizzy with hunger and oxygen
And it was so goddamn cold

And then i can't see my shoe to tie it
Eyes full of tears and i'm not a crier
And you were so goddamn cold

And ever since
There's only heartbreaking you
Maybe you shoulda let me drown

All i wanted was to swim out to sea
I only wanted us to swim out to sea
Maybe you shoulda let me drink
Maybe you shoulda let me speed

In a well-lit mexican restaurant
I order badly, so we make out
Tequila in our hands
We'll never breathe again

"
33538,"

Sleeping in the valley, valley of ill fortune
Waking cross the river, river of delusion
Full moon lures the waves, waves of desperation
Empty hearts and mouths wither away

So close your eyes
Slow your breath
Dream of northern lights
Around this dance of death

No abandones, no llores, busca tu rio
No te sientas perdido
Gira, vuelta y vuelta gira
Danza de la muerte
Que viene a verte
Bailala

Cup your hands to her parched heart, parched and
Broken heart
No water here to drink way downstream
One goes where the water flows and water's running dry
So don't give up no don't cry, don't cry

Just close our eyes
Pretend we forget
North country dreams
Twist this dance of death

Danza de la muerte
Si viene a verte
Que bailando te encuentre
Bailando, girando
Danza de la muerte

Spin round, spin round, spin round
Vuelta, vuelta, muerte

Bailala

"
33539,"

Watching your eyes go back and forth
Out on the highway
Watching your heart bend to the road
Kiss your forehead as I turn to go

Following those signs
Driving out
Only engine smoke frozen in a cloud
Wishing the space would remain
You're holding back your tears
From letting go of your heart
Leaving the middle of the road
Letting go just a little bit
Till it all spills out the side of the road

Hole in the sea
Hole in the heart
There's a hole in your hand
Where the money just falls
And the pain falls right through
The hole in your head
That wears right through

The hole in all your plans
There's a hole that shines right through

Yo canto de mi corazon
Y tu mi amigo me inspiras mis pasos
Me voy por el mundo conociendo varia gente
Pero nunca hallé una persona como tu

Mirame ya estoy aqui
Si pudieras mirarme que pensaras de mi
Pero hoy es muy tarde para decirte que soy cambiado
Me duele me duele que ya no estas aqui

Ya es muy tarde
Para decirte que soy cambiado

Mirame ya estoy aqui
Si pudieras mirarme que pensaras de mi
Pero hoy es muy tarde para decirte que soy cambiado
Me puede me duele que ya no estas aqui

Marco's shadow falls on the door
To the 7 Lost Cities of Gold
Finds a raven's head and rattler's tail
Dead in his tracks, this Godforsaken soul's
Unwanted here and his curse lingers for years

Amalia's face hides behind the mask
Sweating on the TV factory line
That smile on her face is starting to crack
While welding back the pieces of a shattered heart
That's scattered out here, with the ghosts of her peers
Searches for her lost child along the River of Tears... the River of Tears

The end of the working week
When drunken worlds meet;
Both sides keeping a close eye
For a break in the line here... on the Crystal Frontier

Ramon tightens up his leather belt
And slips on through a hole in the fence
He can get you anything you want
It might cost you a life, it might cost you
The whole price of freedom here...on the Crystal Frontier
Searching for your lost love along the River of Tears... the River of Tears

Blood spills out on the streets
And bodies are missing for weeks;
Both sides keeping a close eye
Watching the bullets fly here... on the Crystal Frontier
...Crystal Frontier

[Verse 1: Joey Burns]
There are code breakers with lines well tapped
Traces sweeping out across the static night
You are draped in white like the blossoms of the tree
Looking down a glass elevator
At your father signing the papers for

[Chorus]
Two silver trees, two silver trees
Two worlds in need, two silver trees
Branches falling down
From sources underground
False identities
Stranded in each single seed

False sense of warning no poisoned cup
Just deception crawling up like a snake
Decay of the blossoms and roots well hacked
Spoil the hidden waters dying at the base of

Red Blooms

When the fists of winter fly
Driving bones into the snow
Blackened frostbitten nights
Vodka running dry

The statues cloaked in white
Migrants from museums
Losing all the feeling now that
Sunrise is outlawed

Strangers plant themselves
Down in the cold hard ground
Later when the harvest thaws
Snow drops will be in bloom

Crossed out on city maps
Prospekt Mira reveals
Shadows drinking antifreeze
Neath the underpass

Ordered once a gulag’s march
Now cities send the call
Falling from the rooftops fast
And frozen against the wall

Where strangers plant themselves
Dead souls of the underground
When February thaws
Snow drops will be in bloom again

Bloom again, bloom again
Bloom again, bloom again
Red blooms, red blooms

Wire fences still coiled with flowers of the night
Songs of the birds like hands call the earth to witness
Sever from fear before taking flight

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands

Me siento solo y perdido
Una vela alumbra mi camino
Cruzando tierras que nunca he visto
Cruzando el río de mi destino
Solo soy un chico mas
Que sueña en alto y mirando al mar

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands

Man Made Lake

I'm gonna walk these streets
Of cold concrete
Like I'm a ghost
Searching for its grave

Then I'll dwell by the edge of this man made lake
And descend into the city
That holds no place for me

But the streets
With no stir of life
And all the houses on the streets
Are wholly submerged

Then I'll gather the leaves from cell phone trees
And return them
To their place
And pretend someone's calling for me

Fractured Air (Tornado Watch)

From the delta to the plains
Storms touching down again
Devil's hiding in the house
Angel's in the rain

Corrugated lovers swimming on the wire
Switching on and off the breakers
On a night like this
No one should be alone

In the fractured air
Misfired from a distress flare
All the while searchlights reconcile
Cut their losses and run

Clinging to the rooftop
Losing track of days
Devil's up in the attic
Angel's lost her way

Must've misdialed the number
Or the telephone's died
Lost you in the darkness
And never heard back
Dropped out from the night
Like a stone

Falling from the fractured air
Misfired like a distress flare
All the while searchlights reconcile
Cut their losses and run

"
33547,"

Felt a tremor stir beneath my breath
That forecasts storms on the gallup poll
Woke up from the nightmare news
And hoping to read a sign in the morning air

Nothing changes here and nothing improves
All say my friends who just want out
And leave these troubles behind
Scatter like paper in the eye of the storm
Documented with a silent snow
That's only heard from far away

More cards in play, follow in suit
Everywhere you look, you only see red
And wonder when to call off the race
Watching a horse running down its last legs
Just when you think it couldn't get much worse
Watch the numbers rise on the death toll
And the chimes of freedom flash and fade
Only heard from far, far away

I hear you can't trust in your own
Now the gray is broken in the early morn
And the words forming barely have a voice
It's just your heart that's breaking without choice

Everything you've learned is distorted in your head
Bouncing off the walls, unraveling the thread
Staying up with the blue screen glow
Forgetting everything you ever dreamed years ago

When the dread is flowing down my veins
I want to tear it all down and build it up again
Tear it all down, build it up again

Hear your heart that's breaking without choice
I want to hear those chimes ring again
Ring again

A large headscarp slammed Concordia last night
A wave of sludge too dense to fit
Our floor gave out, and we're tumbling
Headfirst without all our things into a rift

Please don't till another wasteland
You won't get the chance to tunnel through
Or bend another kickstand
You infuriate me when you crash and contract tuberculosis
You should take care of your lungs
Before you knees and all that quicksand collide

The truss roof gave out
With planks and rebar pummeling our backs
We make it out
And shake our fists

כמה זה מספיק? נהיה לי בור בנשמה
אני סופר עוד תיק, ואז  אתה...אתה
משהו לא ותיק, חי על אחרים, מצחיק
אני מנשק את הריק, מגיע לפיק מפליק לך
אתה לא מפסיק להציק מריק אותך
כי זה לא שיק, זה דביק להקשיב לך
מעדיף צבע מתייבש, מרחיק אותך
מדליק שקט עם מצית

הקסם שלא ישוב עוד, יותר מדי לעבוד
בורח לך מהאיי פוד
בחורות עם דגל שחור מעל הראש
בני אדם עם דגל לבן רוצים לפרוש

כולם מתפרנסים ממה שאנחנו מחרבנים

גמישים מספיק כדי להכיל אנשים

אמיתי כבר, נושמים כבר, מחליפים מיצים
משבים נעימים, ונניח וחיוכים מתפרסים
ונניח ומתרפסים, הופכים
לכלונסאות של פשרות, למאגר של קלישאות
ולא מרגישים צורך לנסח אמיתות
ונניח שנניח את עצמנו בצד (יה)
ננתח את הרגע לבד
ונניח והבנו שזאת הבדידות שדחפה
אותנו זה לזרועות זה באותה השעה
צא מזה אבי, היא לא בקטע

נניח שלא היית כלבה

הניסיונות הפטאטיים שלי לגרום לך לעזוב איתי לאנשהו
ונניח שניסיתי באמת, באמת ניסיתי
כל כך ניסיתי שתגידי את האמת
נניח היית מאמינה כל פעם שהצטערתי
נניח שלא היית ניהנת כל פעם שנשברתי
ונניח שלא היית שוברת אותי, אחרי ששברתי אותך
אחרי ששברת אותי, כשכבר היינו שבורים
ונניח שהריבים המטופשים, זאת לא הסיבה היחידה
שבגללה אנחנו מדממים
ונניח שלא היית אומרת לי לא
כשרציתי שנעבור לגור לנצח בין הסדינים
ונניח, שלא היית משאירה אותי פה
בעולם זה - המלא אחריות ואורות מתעתעים

[וורס 3 - טאבו+]
אז נניח שהכל היה שונה
העדפתי כל כך שתזרקי אותי את, שתניחי לזה
שתוותרי על זה שויתר על עצמו
לא מסוגל לראות אותך בוכה, אני כזה
ונניח שכתבתי את הבית הזה עם מחק
הנחתי שהחיים לא עושים לי הנחות
שילמתי מחיר מופקע על שק ריק מחלומות
שוב הפכתי לזה שאף פעם לא רציתי להיות
אז נניח שיש לי מושג מה אני רוצה
וכשחזרתי בפעם הרביעית האמנתי בזה (באמת)
אף פעם לא טענתי שאני בוגר
ולא חזרתי גם הפעם בשביל לכתוב פזמון חוזר
ונניח שזה לא דעך 3 שנים
פאקינג 3 שנים, איך שמרתי את זה בפנים
ואולי זאת הייתה רק הנוחות, אנחות רווחה

אמרו לי שאפסיק לשמוע ראפ, לצאת מזה, הא?
גיל 26 עושה את זה, בפעם השנייה
הלבד שהיה מעולם לא השתנה
תמיד חסר משהו, מתמלא רק ממוזיקה
זה לא מספיק, והדרישות שלי
ממאירות כמו סרטן, צריך למות על עצמי
התגייסנו, אני קרבי, אבי לא מוגדר
בטלפון לבנון לקלקיליה, זה לא נגמר

ב- 2004 השתחררתי מהצבא
נמצא בעבודה שאני שונא
בוסים עם דולרים בעניינים רוצים שאהיה חלק מזה
שומע אנשים שמדברים, על מה ועל איך
נו על מי אתם עובדים
אנ’לא רוצה לראות אותכם בגיל 30
מאוננים בפלורנטין, עושים סמים קלים
כל הסיפורים הגדולים גוססים
גם ההיפ הופ מת, גם אותו מעבירים לסין
מרגיש כמו השיח אחמד יאסין
יושב בכסא גלגלים מחכה לסיכולים ממוקדים
חברות תקליטים הבטיחו לי שמיים
אחרי שנתיים נשארתי עם הזין בעין
אומרים שהחיים הם החיים

פיש עזב מעבר לים
עושה צעדים גדולים אבל חולם לחזור לכאן

זאת מתקפת היורמים

נלחמים בטחנות רוח ישנות, מנסים לא להתייאש מזה

חברים הופכים זרים, משפטים הופכים נדושים
הכל אמיתי מדי, איך אנחנו גדלים?
ממהר להספיק, לפני ששוב נישאר

מקום שבו דעות מנומקות הם נחלת בודדים
מקום שבו קונצנזוס מכווץ אשכים
מתבייש להגיד, אי אפשר להפחיד
וגם לא להכחיד, אפטיות, זה לא מגליד
הם לא, רוצים כבר, להתרגש
אני לא נוטה להתייאש
בימים שאי אפשר להתאחד על כלום
צריך רק להתכופף קדימה ולשמן את הרקטום
כי יש יותר מדי, לא רוצים לשמוע
אבל אז יש יותר מ-דיי, וזה ממשיך לפגוע
וזה גלגל כזה שמסתובב בטירוף
פעם אתה למטה, פעם אתה חשוף
הפעם אתה גולש שיכור בעורקים של עצמך
ומודה לאח הגדול, על השגרה

[פזמון]

[וורס 3 - אבי גולצמן]
בזמן שלאנשים היה כבוד וגאווה
בזמן שמילה הייתה מילה
איפה שמאמינים בלחיצות ידיים
ולא מפחדים מלהסתכל לך בעניים
איפה שהאמינו בעתיד טוב יותר
שלא ידעו לוותר, שלא רצו מהר
לפני זמנים פוסט-מודרניים
איפה שהגיבורים מתים והמלאכים בוכים
לפני שהרגנו את אלוהים, ונשארנו לבד
(נשארנו לבד, נשארנו לבד)
לפני שהפכנו מציצנים, ונשארתי בצד
(נשארתי בצד, נשארתי בצד)
לפני שהתשובות התמססו, העשירים התבססו
המהפכות כבר תססו
לפני תרבות הדגל הלבן, זה לא זמן טוב
בשביל להיות פה בנאדם

Found and put it down
I'm tired enough
Off the top of your head
Take 'em by the shore
Bind up your easy mark
What's it gonna fix
Mistimed your play
The random hour
Just put your name on the thing

Used to understand
It's sorry we're shut
Not sorry we're closed
Tonight is up or so I wanna tell you
My whisper wire companion schill

Chorus

This time around
With your chin against the curb
You nail your colors to the pole
This time around, you can't see behind
No matter, you gotta, wanna
Inamorata

Did the song
Carry it along
I turned it up
See where it shows
Side by, side by
Side by, side by
Side by, side by
Side by, side

Turn on the tap
Go on with you
What ought'a be done
What ought to be

Something got visual KO
I dig it fast
So your gonna phone it
And then a who can not feel the same?
Chasin' tail away we go
And do you want say come
From wrongs and spills
Come home but don't stay dumb for long
Long sent home from Boston
Don't fall horsey
Don't say

We been runnin' round goin' downtown
Downtown downtown

Announce a need
It's not a form
Not a phone
He knows it ain't no location
He knows I'm on
Let him go
Let him go
Boy, yeah
Boy, you know

It ends already
It ends alright

We been runnin' round goin' downtown

Got to see was I in love
And what her hands held on
That it would only hold so long
But i was all wrong
Wrong, but did it all
Does it, don't know
Does it want of its own

Oh no, no, no, no

Don't, done
Don't, do, don't, don't
Why can't you show me how you did that
Note well I'm steady i do that
Don't, done, done
Thrill is gone
Why did you do that
Went into blind
And do the time

Soon, and what would you do
Hand it off
To what your hands held on
Ran it in
When did it run
Did it run
Oh no, no
Gone, where did it go
Was it, don't know
Was it one of it's own
Was it one of it's own
Oh no, oh no, no

Got four, no more
So bide in time
Standing sideways
Threadbare, dirty, and faded
Wax on outdated
Folded metal shown through
Sullied + simple too

Bright chord, no more
It's fine it's mine
Shifting simply
Joyride, cuts and I'm taken
Hold on maintain it
Like found raided its true
Shaped it and played it too

Do you get
Feature of what you sow
Fervor a love affair
Spec to a stopping point
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Nest a weir
Fervor a love affair
It's always good, it's good to find other ways

Chorus
Wait for a wheel, will he roll-o
Time to re-learn, same as yours
Talk to them, come to hand
Will he roll-o
But at what cost, best at first

Go, but i go
Find a wire as i go
Day before another day
It's always good, good to find better ways

Called a little
A little calm, called away
You hold and it's over

Come on calm, as to convey
Even fine, ever fair
Wait and then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know

And to feed the one, again
To feed the one, again

Down letter, phone rang
Kinda got a roll a vote of no
Found under pressure
Gotta go, gotta go

Then they'll know

And to feed the one, again
To feed the one, again

What did you have in mind
Should, should I think of everything
Well I'm already blind
And that's, that's how I do things

Old, Old story and the same old song

Making the same mistakes
Why do i even try
Can't put my finger on it, now
And yet, and yet here I go again

Old, Old story and the same old song

All of the weeks I spent
Fighting and socializing
And just, and just where did it get me
Older, but not much wiser

Old, Old story and the same old song

What did you have in mind
Should I think of everything

Old, Old story and the same old song

Indian Summers
Are always awkward, I think
Warn orange air
Cold apartments
Open windows and cars
Sharing a city and basement floors
Don't waste time in case we think twice
Don't waste time, in case we think twice

Tore my shirt
Living a lie
Shed my guilt til there was no regret
Messed up a situation by not making it happen
Together on Sundays
West coast states are a dream
Don't waste time in case we think twice

Indian Summers
Are always awkward, I think
Warm orange air
Cold apartments
Open windows and cars
Together on Sundays
West coast states are a dream
Don't waste time in case we think twice

Comin' loose, not holding back
It's all everyone has left
Letting it out not letting it down
At least tonight

Hit it high for something more
Lose it all to lose everything
Give it all for free, though i already did
Tell me what happened
It could be better

Oh, oh, oh

Hit it high for something more
Lose it all to lose everything
Give it all for free, though i already did
Tell me what happened
It could be better

Oh, oh, oh

Come in 2 minutes, I've lost
Pearly whites and formal grab
It's been open its been had
It leaves you blind

Hit it high for something more
Lose it all to lose everything
Give it all for free, though i already did
Tell me what happened
It could be better

Oh, oh, oh

"
35541,"

It's now forever and how
There's no turning back now
And which one of us won?
Or did we both lose

Tattered in our new clothes, uh huh
And keeping our space

But we are still fond, after all
Thats happened

I drink and swear it's shame
Still you care about me
How could you put up with it
When i ain't worth shit

I'm always gone all the time
But remembered to lock the doors

But we are still fond, after all
Thats happened

I know sometimes I tick you off
I should really think before i talk
Just take my word it was just a joke
You know I'll never leave you dear
Because all of my stuff is here

I come home, cuz I know you're there
Asleep in our bed
And it will go on that way

After all that's happened

Cuz we are still fond
After all that's happened

Cuz we are still fond
After all that's happened

"
35543,"

Chorus
It could be you
It could be me
It could be everything we see
Given the day, given the time, given the moment

Some of it comes
Consequence flows
Keep your legs on
Iron bound, turn to spurn

Could you be, in a world
But not of any world
Could you stand in the center
Of a space and beware

Chorus

Some of it comes
Consequence flows
Keep your legs on
Iron bound, turn to spurn

Could you be
Anything, anywhere
Up above
Down below
Would you stand
Would you think on the zone?

And the morning could be yours
And the dog could be ours
And the night we could give it away

[Intro]
Stanaj
This is the way I love her
Oh, RedOne
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

[Verse 1]
Butterflies come out when she opens up her mouth
Never heard more perfect sounds
I'm so deep in I could drown
Her eyes are on my eyes
While that girl is walking by
But I could have that anytime
Baby, you're my only type

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the best
You're the worst
Feels so good and then it hurts
It hurts, oh
I'm blessed, I'm cursed
But it all makes sense to me

[Chorus]
This is the way I love her
Don't wanna touch no other
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't give out my codes
So I wonder how she knows?
How to reach inside of me
Chain me up then set me free
She's a real perfectionist
I know where perfection is
When she climbs on top of me
In the moments no one sees

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the best (You're the best babe)
You're the worst
Feels so good and then it hurts
It hurts, oh
I'm blessed, I'm cursed
But it all makes sense to me

[Chorus]
This is the way I love her
Don't wanna touch no other
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

[Bridge]
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Ooh

[Chorus]
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her (I love you babe)
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

תתן כבוד לרצונות לחזיונות לתובנות שלי
לקחת לי תביט אחי, הלכו הכוונות שלי
אין מצב שזה יקרה מבין, מוציא תחסכונות שלי
בונה לי תאולפן מאהבה, זו האמת שלי
חי בתוך בועה עם אוזניות שמזינות אותי
מטפס בתוך עצמי עם מחשבות שמטעינות אותי
אם סוני לא המציאו תמכשיר שיעצור אותי
אז נורמה חברתית, בטח לא תלכוד אותי
הספקתי להכיר, המון אנשים
כאלה שהפסיקו לחיות ולא מרגישים
כאלה שהפסיקו לראות, את מופע הקסמים
חיים בליסינג תפעולי וכמו תמיד מונשמים
אותו צינור ,אותו חמצן, אותו שעון ואין בו זמן
אותן עיניים עצומות, שמחפשות לאן
לא אני, אני עומד איתן
בונה את הקונסטרוקציות, עד שזה מוכן

[פזמון: שי פישמן]
מביט גבוה
אין גבול לרצון
מנצח את הזמן
דרך מבט מהחלון
בוחן ת'מרחק
רואה שמיים גדולים
לא אני לא אפסיק אני לא אפסיק
עד שיגמרו לי המילים

[וורס 2: אבי הקטן]
משקיע את המקסימום ומקבל את המינימום
מעל שכר הכמעט כלום, סוגר עוד חודש עקום
בריצת המרתון הזאת רצים זומבים היום
חיים לא נותנים לישון
הם תופסים אותי ראשון
לא מקבל את העובדה שלא אצליח להגשים חלום
נדחס לתוך קרון רכבת, במירוץ להשכלה גבוהה
עובד בשביל ללמוד בשביל לעבוד עוד שנה
מסר אופטימי? אין לי כמו ביבי
צועק סומסום היפתח, מתגעגע לימי קיפי
הדלת לא נפתחת, פופ-פוליטיקה במוזיקה
ורוקהוליק בעבודה אבל שונא אותה
בדד, לא מבין מה עושים ב-חיים ה-אלה
איך מקדמים הא? קדימה, הסוף ידוע במילא
אני לא רוצה להיות ראש ממשלה
אבל רוצה לשנות משהו במדינה הזאת

כל אחד רוצה להיות משהו, מישהו
כל אחד רוצה להיות משהו, מישהו
רוצה להיות משהו

[וורס 1: צ'ה]
אני לא דוגמן או עורך דין, אחי כדאי שתבין
אני בחרתי נשארתי בחוץ, כדי להבין
אך כולם רוצים להיות משהו, מישהו
עדיין אין לי הסבר, אבל יש לי טישו
אישיו, המון דמויות לחלק
אין פה שום דבר חדש מלבד הלוג'יק של מאק ריק
מהשראה רע, מביט במראה
!שעה 25, אני אומר פאק יו

[וורס 2: אבי הגדול]
כל אחד רוצה להיות מישהו, אני
רק רוצה שיהיה מישהו איתי
לא מתעניין בדואטים עם זמרות טפטים
יחסים באסמסים לא בשבילי
קופץ על החיים באבויויו
הם בורחים ממני, בואו לפה יו
ובחיים האלה אני לא אזכה בלוטו
אז אמיתי רק מתקן את הנשמה שלי

[גשר] X2
חייב להיות ההוא שההיא מקנא לו
רוצה להיות ההוא שעושה מה שבא לו
שזה שהולך נגד מה שהוכתב לו
מי שמתקן את הנשמה שלו

כל אחד רוצה להיות משהו, מישהו
כל אחד רוצה להיות משהו, מישהו
כל אחד רוצה להיות משהו, מישהו

[+ וורס 3: טאבו]
אינסוף פרצופים לכל אחד יש סיפור
לכל אחד יש ת'מבט הלא פתור
כל אחד סוחב בתיק גב זיכרון שבור
מהימים שהאמין שהעסק לא גמור
החלומות שלך ירדפו אותך אם לא תרדוף אותם
אמר לי תסריטאי שהשמין מפורצ'ין קוקיס
כבר ימים שכולם רוצים להיות כולם
אני רק רוצה להיות אמסי עם גרופיז ממין נקבה

[וורס 4: אבי הקטן]
תתחברי לי לפלאג שמועות אומרות שהוא מטעין
אסוציאציות רצות כמו 2000 קומבינציות בסלוט משין
אחח, כואב הלב, יושב חושב
ומחשב איך אני מתקרב לסוף
אוי, אני חיי ת'חיים
בחלומות על בית הספר ונקמת היורמים
הסופרסטאר הבא-בא בא מראש העין
ועוד דבר, חכי שתראי לי את הזין

[גשר] X2
חייב להיות ההוא שההיא מקנא לו
רוצה להיות ההוא שעושה מה שבא לו

Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
This is the story of eclectic prawn
He wears a little pretty crown
Dancing through the bubbles
He is now standing on the bottom of the sea
He knows his look thanks to the eyeballs
Of the fishes swimming nearby his throne
He may be fooled by those reflections
As it happens even up in the shore
Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
He's regarded like a king
Of the sea he never talked to me
I still think he is a gentleman i
Don't wanna bother him until i might
And now it's time to visit his castle
I hope i'll know who i am
I'm sure i'll find good vibes
Hot salty sparkling water

Time's been known to flicker
Drag uneven, fly
Good things come much quicker
When you don't desperately try

Lie back, attack, a whisper
Praise all they deny
Lift one holy finger
Don't apologize

Where's my magic, where's my drug?
One more reassuring cup
Hot like fortune
Cold like fame
Never more and more, again

Give me what I don't know
Corner every eye
Bottom over elbow
Don't apologize

Where's my magic, you're my drug
One more reassuring hug
Warm like fortune
Hold my frame
Nevermore and more, again

"

Look at you hiding behind your sweater
What I want to say
Let it fall away
I don't care

If we're alone, can be trusted on my own
I can never bring you home

Second guess I drift in all directions
Once impressed, half undressed all day
I'm not strong You don't believe
I may be wrong
That I can never bring you home

If I do and don't resist you
I'm too in love to really miss you
In fact I'm frozen over joy

Yes I did and yes I want to
But nothing good can come to
Someone pretending he is alone

Yes I did and yes I want to
But nothing good can come to
Someone pretending he is alone
Who can never bring you home

Hit me like a kick to a thickening gut
The beat has done beaten me up
No one's gonna lift me out of this rut
The groove has done ground me to dust
I'm knocking on the wrong cocoon
Spun another web of lies

And then you break through
And dry before my eyes
Take me with you
Where you hide tonight

Did you feel the beat in a fetal curl?
Could you be original, caterpillar girl
Crawling up the vine
Splitting your spine

Flowing through the motions
Leave your shell behind

And then you break through
And dry before my eyes
Take me with you
Where you hide tonight
Away...
Look out
The birds like me
They want you now
They want you now
Caterpillar Girl

And then you break through
And dry before my eyes
Take me with you
Where you hide tonight

Come back home

Would you pick me up
Throw me in the river and wait a while
Then you fish me up, make a big fire
And hold me tight

[Chorus]
And I know
What do you know
I know together we""ll all
Come back home
We""ll all come back home
Home, home, home

Everything will go my way
Even if it isn""t there
We will find another better way
It has come and it is gone

We'll come home
We""ll all come back home

I saw my best friend counting his heartbeat
I saw the best days wasted on sleeping in
Try hard to feel it, mind has now wandered
Hands meant to hold hands, kept from the cold, I don't know
Kids riding two lives, swung from the branches
Kept in our backyards, soon to be sunsets
Oh summer blister, smoking in the van
Go down together, the pavement we've conquered

Cosas que ya no existen
Y que no se ven más
Tuviste la suerte
De verlas pasar
Dejaste todo encima
El lápiz y el papel
Tu ropa y unas notas
Que se pueden leer

Para ti que eres una piedra en un lugar
Y yo otra piedra que cayó acá
Hablando sobre unas cosas estás
De la manera que quieras

Cosas que se refieren
A otras por pasar
El mar está adelante
Vamos a nadar
Olvidé algunas cosas
El lápiz y el papel
Mi ropa y unas notas
Que se pueden leer

Pero tú, que eres una piedra en un lugar
Y yo otra piedra que cayó acá
Hablando sobre unas cosas estás
De la manera que quieras

(x5)
Y todas las piedras
Se esconden, se buscan
Se rompen, desarman
Y se vuelven a armar

Y tu me dices
Las piedras

Para ti que eres una piedra en un lugar
Y yo otra piedra que cayó acá
Hablando sobre unas cosas estás
De la manera que quieras

De paso estabas pensando en algo
Que olvidas a medida que viene tú
Yo creo tú sabes pienso lo mismo
Lo olvido a medida que eres tú

Y todo lo que pienso esta en suspenso
No prefiero nada antes que seguir así

Yo creo tú sabes pienso lo mismo
El ritmo se reinventa desde ti
Detienes el paso creas la marcha
Que avanza a medida que vienes tú

Y todo lo que piensas esta suspenso
No prefiero nada antes que seguir así
Todo lo que creo esta en suspenso otra vez
No prefiero nada antes que seguir así

Podemos hablar y nunca decir nada más
Cuando nos decimos
Siempre se olvida todo
Queremos estar en el mismo lugar
Yo soy tu vecino
Mi casa siempre será la tuya

De paso estabas pensando en algo
Que admiro a medida que eres tú
Los libros que leemos en voz alta
Se explican y hablan de ti

[Verse 1]
Si te volvieras, vuélvete a mí
Cabeza despierta, despierta aquí
Figura correcta, domíname así
Como tú te mueves, me muevo hacia ti

[Verse 2]
La fuerza extranjera, te luce tan bien
Se esconden las manos y se muestra después
La vista domina, rodeada se ve
Suspendes la vida, me quedo sin ver

[Hook]
Lara, lará, la
Lara, lará, la

[Verse 3]
Todos los días, se dejan de más
Caen los metales, que pesan
Victoria plena, rendición total
Entrega completa, comienza mal

[Verse 4]
Victoria plena, rendición total
Entrega completa, comienza a amar
Victoria Roma, rendición total
Qué piensas ahora? Comienza a amar

Podríamos sacar algunas copias y repartir
Si no es gratis es malo
Perdamos la plata y subamos el pelo
El orden es como un clima
Liso por fuera y blanco por dentro

Tuviéramos que ser algo resuelto y defender
Es tan limpio el peso
Que tiene el uso que se carga con esto

Si mirando por encima y debajo no encuentro el cambio
Quedo mirando el frente el piso sin tiempo ni espacio
Que es horizontal
Sin altura ni ancho
Es horizontal
Sin prisa ni grandes cambios

No mido las direcciones me quedo seco en su campo
Principio de la línea yo quedo pensando en el espacio
Que es horizontal
Sin altura ni ancho
Es horizontal
Sin prisa ni grandes cambios

Quisiéramos tener una persona y representar
Un espacio en su vida
Se guardan los unos para unirlos a otros
El blanco es parte de todo
Seco en su clima y negro en el fondo

I saw a bird today
Had to break up in the sun
Absence of words
Signs of the time to come

Sweet clean water
Cooling in the breeze
Breaking my first sweat
A little more fun

I saw a bird today
Had to break up in the sun
Bereft of words
It's a little more fun

I saw a bird today
Had to break up in the sun
Absence of words
Signs of my time to come
Sweet clean water
Cooling in the breeze
Breaking my first sweat
I just had to break up

Sometimes words get in the way
Sometimes they help me say
What I need to say

Sometimes words get in the way
I get mixed up
I don't know what to say

Sometimes words get in the way
But you help me
Push the words out of the way

It's so hard
I feel like a card
Sometimes words get in the way
Sometimes they help me say

I want to play around with words
You help me go
You help me go all the way
Sometimes words get in the way
Sometimes they help me say
Sometimes words help me say
What I really need to say
I love you

Venus and all your charms
You are as old as the sun
Venus and all your charms
I fall into your arms
Venus and all your warmth
Each night I'm in your arms

I saw a bird today
Had to break up in the sun
Absence of words
Signs of the time to come

Sweet clean water
Cooling in the breeze
Breaking my first sweat
A little more fun

I saw a bird today
Had to break up in the sun
Bereft of words
It's a little more fun

I saw a bird today
Had to break up in the sun
Absence of words
Signs of my time to come
Sweet clean water
Cooling in the breeze
Breaking my first sweat
I just had to break up

Oh Lord I'm going down
The tunnel with the light at the end
Can I get you some help?
Can I get some?

Oh Lord I'm falling down
The tunnel with the light at the end

Oh Lord I'm falling down
The deep well I dug for myself
I did it for myself
I did it for myself

If it feels like you need more
I can leave if you said enough

Hole in the house
Where we learn to the rest
Hearts in the pipes
You say that I'm unfair
How else could I have treated you like that?
Family stopped six feet, we turned and ran

If it feels like you need more, honey
Take a walk outside in the yard
There's patches in the dreams now (Ah, Ah)
I haven't got use to the love
There's nothing left to read but catalogs
Nothing left to see here

I'll make a list
I'll count in each instance
Our only house is big since I left
At night I like to smoke in secret
We can be discrete in my basement

If it feels like you need more...
If it feels like you need more...
If it feels like you need more, honey
Take a walk outside in the yard
There's patches in our dreams now (Ah, Ah)
I haven't got use to the look
There's nothing left to read but catalogs
Nothing left to see here

[Verse 1]
Black Girls in dresses
I want them to call
Comes in a vision
Like orange in the fall

Under the party
Lead through the store
I've got good credit
Built over months

Drums and a needle
Stomps on the floor
Much of the middle
And out the front door

[Chorus]
Oh no
Crime gets caught
Time gets lost
But, but it feels good

[Verse]
Under the highway
Shoulder is close
Sold me a lemon
I drove into a hole

Back at your driveway
Won't lose my thirst
Sold me a lemon
Your ugly male nurse

[Hook]
I stand in the doorway
I'm stressed at your waist
Slowly I retrace
Goes for short term

[Chorus]
Oh no
Crime gets caught
Time gets lost
But, but it feels good

[Bridge]
Oh mama
How does she see
Facing my feet
Stains in my teeth
And my knees
Marks on my knees (x3)

The sound of the motor
Bounds of the color
(Yeah)
Oh make me
Wait for me now
Make my muscle bleed out

Oh make me
Wait for me now
Make my muscle bleed out

Oh make me
Wait for me now
Make my muscle bleed

Oh make me
Wait for me now
Make my muscle bleed out

Under the party
Lead through the store
I've got good credit
Built over months

Drums and a needle
Stomps on the floor
Much of the middle
And right out the front door

You stand in the doorway
I'm stressed at your waist
Slowly I retrace
Goes for short term

In the morning when I wake up
I think about how I can get you
Tonight, tonight

In the morning when I wake up
I think about how I can get to your heart
Into your heart

I am starving, I feel empty
My life's a boredom
Without you for me my knight
Stay here tonight

Hey
Show me the way to your heart
Way to your heart
Way to your heart

I will love you
I'll adore you
So show me how I can find
The way to your heart
Tonight

Hey, show me the way to your heart
Way to your heart
Way to your heart
Way to your heart

I see the darkness in your eyes
I taste darkness in your eyes
I'm headin' to the city of love
Blue city of love
Strange city of love

I see the light in your eyes
You preach light with your eyes
I'll take you to the city of love
Blue city of love
Strange city of love

Hide your eyes from me
Take reflection and you'll see
How I'm there in your mind
Working my way out

I see the darkness in your eyes
You're breathing the darkness in your eyes
We're now in the city of love
Blue city of love
Strange city of love

Hide your eyes from me
Take reflection and you'll see
How I'm there in your mind
Working my way out

Too hot for tea, but I'll drink it anyway
It's a nice day
Too late for him, but I'll take him anyway
Its a nice day
Happy to be alive

Some believe in god
Some worship the devil
Some go to church
Others pray to the moon

On a nice day
On a nice day
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they say
On a-

Mother on the phone, she is older and grey
Asking her little girl to come back and stay
Politicians on the radio and tv today
Talkin' 'bout how great it is and you say...

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they say
On a-

It doesn't matter that this place is so so sad

They talk about what's hot and cool
They swear by today
Looking at them I think they're fools
Life goes on anyway

The day is gone with the light
As always we all came here to bid farewell
And yet we don't get that the star has died

But I'm standing on the other shore
I can see everything from here
Standing on the other shore

It's dark over the city and the tower
I've gained nothing -
Same as you have, believe me

And I'm not scared of pain
What's to fear? pain is my sister
I pray to her

And still I stand on the other shore
Where I see everything
I stand on the other shore

And I talk about what's hot and cool
And I swear by today
I look at myself and think I'm a fool
Life goes on anyway

It's good the century has died
Although not all came to say ""goodbye""
But we don't get that the star is still alive

And I still stand on the other shore
Where I can see everything
I stand on the other shore
I land on the other shore
And I see everything, I get to the other shore
I stand on the other shore where I see everything
I stand on the other shore
Come and stand with me on this shore
Where I see everything
Come and stand with me on this shore!

1:1 I am alive. I am a Man

1:2 I am the oldest man alive

1:3 I have been alive forever

1:4 I sit atop My mountain stronghold and I look down at the other men
At My feet and I laugh. I laugh at you. You, the Lesser Men, you
Whose lives flicker by Me like a cloud of gnats

1:5 You are born and you die as I open and close My eyes to blink

1:6 I watched as My slaves built for Me the Pyramids. I spoke the
Words as they were carved onto the Rosetta stone. I watched as Rome
Burned, as Pompeii was crushed and as the Twin Towers fell

1:7 I have always been. And I will always be. You may see Me, though
You will not know Me. You may see Me at the club, you may see Me on
The street, you will be dazzled by My golden chains, by My spinning
Wheels, by My shining clothes

1:8 I have the biggest Hat in the world. It's got a million diamonds
Hanging from its brim, it's been dyed the color that no painter has
Ever been able to mix, and it could shade all the starving children of
The world at the same time

1:9 I live in the biggest house in the world. It's the size of a
Hundred cities. I can sleep in a different room each night, and my
Bedspread is woven from the hairs of Queens. I drive the fastest car
In the world, its seats are made from human skin. Its lights is
Brighter than a billion suns and its windshield is made out of
Diamonds and dreams

1:10 And oh yeah, I make the loudest beats in the world, when my kick
Drum booms cities crumble and fall. So if you hear my music pumping
You're gonna get fucked up

1:11 I don't have a dick. I don't have a dick. I don't have a dick
I don't have a dick

1:12 I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick dick dick I don't dick I don't have

1:13 I get the finest ass in the world that gets lined up just to
Smell my sweat. I can fuck a hundred people at once 'cause I can make
You come with my eyes

1:14 I have the biggest gun in the world, it can shoot a hole right
Through the Sun. It's like a million atom bombs in my hand while I
Can shoot you in the head just for fun

1:15 I don't have a dick. I don't have a dick. I don't have a dick
I don't have a dick

1:16 I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I
Don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have a dick I don't have
A dick I don't have a dick

2:1 This song is not a metaphor. I do not mean this symbolically. I
Literally don't have a dick. This is my actual physical condition. I
Am missing the biological male reproductive organ. I do not have a
Vagina in its place, I am now and has always been male. I did not
Once have a dick and lose it by my choice or otherwise, nor will I
Ever have one. I am not feminized by this lack. Do not take this to
Mean that I lack for phallos in the psychoanalytic sense, I am not
Powerless, I am not sterile. It is from overcompensation from my
Dicklessness that I have achieved authority and omnipotense. I am not
Great and powerful Because I don't have a dick. I am great and
Powerful And I don't have a dick. This does not make me anti-dick. I
Am not suggesting the removal of dicks and I do not advocate
Castration. This is merely an explanation of a coincidental fact
For Me, posessing or not posessing a dick affects absolutely nothing
I am simply revealing to You, the Listener, through the song my actual
Biological state. So now that We understand each other, sing with Me
The Four Tenents of Our new Civization

2:2 POWER. HONOR. AMBITION. FUTURE

2:3 POWER, no dick. HONOR, no dick. AMBITION, no dick. FUTURE, no
Dick

2:4 I don't have a dick. I don't have a dick. I don't have a dick
I don't have a dick

2:5 I don't have a dick dick dick. I don't have a dick dick dick. I
Don't have a dick dick dick. I don't have a di-i-ick. I don't have a
Di-i-ick. I don't have a di-i-ick. I don't have a di-i-ick. I don't
Have a di-i-ick

How do you stand so straight
When your mind is so crooked?
Paralyzed surprise upon your face
Please don't talk, I'd like to
Remember you just like this
The one who has betrayed me with a kiss
It only stands to reason
With every breath you're breathing
You were bound, bound to let me down
For all your dirty deeds
There must be someone that you can blame
Who taught you all the rules
That's to the game, for lips still red with wine
Telling lies as they're touching mine
Already know how this is gonna go
It only stands to reason
With every breath
You were bound, bound to let me down
You don't know how to say goodbye
And I ain't gonna make you try
So goodbye
It only stands to reason
With every breath you're breathing
You were bound, bound to let me down
How do you stand so straight
When your mind is so crooked?
Walk your crooked mile and think of me

Walkin'thru' the sleepy city
In the dark it looks so pretty
Till I got to the one cafe
That stays open night and day

Just a lookin' at the sleepy city
In the night it looks so pretty
No one sees the city lights
They just care about the warmth inside

No one listens to what people say
I just sit and hear the radio play
Just then this girl walked in my way
And she was as pretty as my sleepy city

Will you walk through the sleepy city
In the night it looks so pretty
Tired of walkin on my own
It looks better when you're not alone

Will you walk through the sleepy city
In the night it looks so pretty
I'm tired of walkin on my own
It looks better when you're not alone

Mm mm mm mm mm mm
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Will you walk through the sleepy city
In the night, well it looks so pretty
I'm tired of walkin on my own
It looks better when you're not alone

C'mon walk through that sleepy city
I said in the night it looks so pretty
I'm tired of walkin that park on my own
It looks better when you're not alone

Your top pants button
Bewildered by the pain oh oh oh
Chocolate makes you happy

When you thrust your fingers
Down your throat and
Wash away what's wrong
Oh oh oh

Out of your mind with happiness
Incredibly dumb, incredibly ugly
To have die the one you await for
All that you sign all that you sign
And wait for
Out of your mind with whorishness
Incredibly young, incredibly filthy
Oh to curse both your life and death
Oh to curse life, oh to curse life
And death!

Chocolate makes you happy
And it keeps you awake
As you unbutton
Your top pants button
Bewildered by the pain oh oh oh
Chocolate makes you happy
Like a credit to the race
As you ruminate in the arms of coco
On the fatness of your face

Out of you mind with slavishness
Rough close and cold
Rough close and cold
To have die that one you await for
All that you sign, blush, wish and pray for
Out of your mind embarrassment
Out of your mind
Out of your mind
Out of your mind out of

Your elaborate garter

I am alone, throwing stones to the dark
Thousand lights on a ship stern glow
Following my eyes
Before the dawn, all of us gone to their homes
Before the dawn, I will be far from this place

I am alone, watching birds flying above
With an empty map, with no thoughts in my head
I was watching them flying above
Before the dawn, seasons are changing too fast
Before the dawn, I will be far from this place

Oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak
Eyelids like empty shells
Oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak

Your love is all that I ever need
So close your sleepy warm eyelids
Through the alleys of ivy
Shivering forest inside you
Shimmering water inside me

Oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak
Eyelids like empty shells
Oh eyelids, long sleep is making me weak

A forest house covered in the shadows, it can't be seen if you got no feathers
A forest house covered with the golden leaves
Only because your smiling face, I can feel safe here
Morning is bringing colored lights all over
A forest house covered in the shadows, it can't be seen if you got no feathers
A forest house covered with the golden leaves

[Chorus]
Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves inside them
Winter gloves and navy coats
Tattered books and nothing more
Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves sleeping by the fire

[Verse 2]
Voices are loud inside our hearts, but they are so quite in ears
Nothing can make our little boat float further
A forest house covered in the shadows, it can't be seen if you got no feathers
A forest house covered with the golden leaves

[Chorus]
Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves inside them
Winter gloves and navy coats
Tattered books and nothing more
Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves sleeping by the fire

[Verse 1]
Slowly float over the seas with the belief
And your heart is in the middle, heart is in the middle of it
Slowly float over the seas with the belief, but
She has no time, no time, honestly

[Chorus]
She's still awake in bed in her white dress
She cannot fall asleep all night
Hold tight your will, no warmth, no heat
No love, only cold lies

[Verse 2]
In the dark of her room she's still thinking of you
All her memories gone but she's still thinking of you
In her heart there's no place for nobody but you
All her memories gone but she's still thinking of you

[Chorus]
She's still awake in bed in her white dress
She cannot fall asleep all night
Hold tight your will, no warmth, no heat
No love, only cold lies

"
41325,"

[Verse 1]
Oh mother of seas, I saw her so long ago
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands
I am drunken by wine, quite as a child, so close to thee
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands

[Chorus]
I am tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
You are so tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
I'm sorry for the pain
Inside of forest shades
We saw each other hardly
So sorry for the pain
Stand still in forest shades
We saw each other hardly, my dear

[Verse 2]
Oh mother of trees, I saw her so long ago
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands
I am drunken by wine, quite as a child, so close to thee
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands

[Chorus]
I am tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
You are so tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
I'm sorry for the pain
Stand still in forest shades
We saw each other hardly
I'm sorry for the pain
Stand still in forest shades
We saw each other hardly, my dear, hardly, hardly

[Outro]
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear

[Verse 1]
My hopes, my will
Were never a part of you
Those days were sad and cold
I'll never want them back again

[Chorus]
But at this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

[Verse 2]
Your voice is pure and soft
It's throwing me back to my hopes
My ears were deaf and cold
Please hold me tight in your arms again

[Chorus]
But at this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

[Chorus]
But at this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

41327,"

[Verse 1]
Like a foam in an antique bath
White snow has covered my head
I am slow slow slow slow slowly dying
My blue colored eyes are almostly blind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see
Huge walls of trees
Huge walls of ice shelves
It takes my breath away

[Chorus]
If everyone is falling on knees
I will almost die for this beauty

[Verse 2]
She touched me
My heart was beating too fast
She walked close to me
My heart was beating too fast

[Pre-Chorus]
How it feels?
Cold arms on me
Hot blood in my chest
I've done everything I can

[Chorus]
If everyone is falling on knees
I will almost die for this beauty
Everyone is falling on knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see
Huge walls of trees
Huge walls of ice shelves
It takes my breath away

[Chorus]
If everyone is falling on knees
I will almost die for this beauty
Everyone is falling on knees
Everyone's falling

41328,"

[Verse 1]
Flying like a paper bird, covered eyes we saw
From the lighthouse up to young clouds
An open path
Flying like a paper bird, grown up trees we saw
From the leopard paw to your heart
Insanity

[Chorus]
No one knows, where our ship floats
From ocean grey and cold, how long will it care about you?
Will it care about us?

[Verse 2]
Flying like a paper bird, golden hills we saw
There's no arrogance, oh brother
Flying like a paper bird, anxious waves we saw
From the lighthouse up to young clouds
An open path

[Chorus]
No one knows, where our ship floats
From ocean grey and cold, how long will it care about you?
Will it care about us?
From ocean grey and cold, how long will it care about you? Or shall we die?

And I don’t care much for the taste in my mouth

I thought I knew myself
Well, I guess I was wrong
This was all a mistake

I don’t care much for your hypocrisy
It doesn’t mean a thing, a fucking thing to me
The stain won’t wash away, and I live to fight another day

Give me one of everything

Remember when i used to be mourning with my buddies
Remember then i can't pretend or make a band or drive a van
Or make a sandwich with my girl friend keep it real remember me
Keep i real not ignore me keep it real come to me keep it real walks with me
Don't be worry I am not happy don’t come to me

Don't be worry I am really happy don't cry with me

Afrodita

Una vez miraba el cielo
Era oscuro y misterioso
Cientos de estrellas
Y entre todas ellas
Una volteó y me brilló

Nunca antes la habia visto
Solo bastó su resplandor
Para saber que eras tú
Que eras tú
Para saber que eras tú
Que eras tú

Dentro de este manto de luces yo podré, reconocerte
Y pondré mi vida en tus manos con todas, mis ilusiones
Yo te llevo en el corazón por todos, los caminos
Quisiera poderme casar contigo, en luna negra

(Chorus)
Yo se que sí
Yo se que si
Yo se que tú también lo sentiste
Yo se que sí
Yo se que sí
Yo se que tú también eso sentiste

Me quiero quedar
Y me estoy cansando
De la humanidad

Si pescamos* un auto
Y nos vamos bien lejos
Cuántos kilómetros deben bastar
Para amar...en el campo
Como antes, a su lado
Me conoces, soy de piedra

Sacas fotos de paisajes
Mientras piensas que debes decir

No quiero quedarme
Me quiero vestir
""porque niña, de que se trata todo esto
Si no de vernos, a los ojos""

Si pescamos un auto
Y nos vamos bien lejos
Cuántos ríos habra que cruzar

Soy transparente
Me puedes oler muy bien
Desde que me presento
No tengo que hablar para darme a entender

Mis ojos te lo dicen todo
Mi boca arrulla lo que pienso
Sabrás que es lo que siento
Con sólo tocar mi piel

No muerdo, ni acaricio
Sólo hiberno todo el tiempo
En mi jaula de almohadas
Dónde nadie sabe la verdad

No tengo voz para decirlo
Por eso vengo y te lo escribo
He deshonrado a mis principios (Otra vez)

No tengo voz para decirlo
Por eso vengo y te lo escribo
He deshonrado a mis principios (Otra Vez)

No tengo voz para decirlo
Por eso vengo y te lo escribo
He deshonrado a mis principios

Nunca he tenido la furia de un león
Siempre tomando el camino corto
Como él me enseñó

No tengo voz para decirlo
Por eso vengo y te lo escribo

It is nice to know you and now that we've met
You've been really kind and I hope you don't regret it yet
You could half become my brother
You could half become my friend
But I cannot stand such kindness, I'd better bring this to an end

Before I start
Before I start

And rather than to lose it I would have it dumped at sea
You could half become my brother
You could half become my friend
But I would only disappoint you, so let's bring this to an end

Before I start to sabotage you
Before I start to watch us drift apart

(Watch us drift apart)
(Watch us drift apart)
(Watch us drift apart)

The me that you know's always sweet and polite
But another part emerges when I'm all alone at night
This one's out to bring it on you, this one's willing to destroy
So run for cover, place no trust in me, or I'll complicate you, boy

Before I start to sabotage you
Before I start (to complicate you)
Before I start to sabotage you
Before I start (to complicate you)

Who has pissed in your umbrella and stole the shoes to Cinderella ?
Who has framed Roger Rabbit, and who married Lory bobbit?
Is it Hammerfall? No! Is it Stratovarius? No?
Michail Gorbaciov? No! No no no no no!
It was Nanowar! It was Nanowar!
Nanowar did it, Nanowar did it
Taller than Mario Bros
Using the pink side of the force
Like Dork Vader on Star Wars
Nanowar did it, Nanowar did it
D-Jedis of universe
Who made Ozzy get so fat cooking his hamburger with a bat?
Who suggested Manowar the title of their album Gods Of War?
Is it Gamma Ray? No! Is it Dragonforce? No!
Is it Lunapop? No! No no no no no!
It was Nanowar! It was Nanowar!
Nanowar did it, Nanowar did it
Taller than Mario Bros
Kickin' ass to all the world!
Lickin' ass to all the whores!
Nanowar did it, Nanowar did it
We're the pimps of Universe
Who looks under a nun's skirt finding things not of this earth?
Who has told the Japanese When make photo you say cheese?
Is it Helloween? Is it Sacred Steel?
Is it Ryanair? No! No no no no no!
It was Nanowar! It was Nanowar!
Nanowar did it, Nanowar did it
Uglier than Michael J. Fox
Using the pink side of the force
Like Dork Vader on Star Wars
Nanowar did it, Nanowar did it
D-Jedis of universe

Running in the sand
Living on the land
The salty breeze was in our eyes
We stood beneath the dragonflies and danced all night

We polished all the chrome
On our rusty little home
We slept all night in parking lots
We tied our hearts in double knots, so tight
So free, so right

Remember when
We were just cherubs in our tender skin
Waiting patiently for life to begin

Flowing so free
Blowing in the breeze
The songs we sung so long ago
With whiskey and an afterglow, we shined like new

But there along the way
Something seemed to change
As weeks turned into months we knew
As life caught up we slowly grew, apart
And untied our hearts

Remember when
We were just cherubs in our tender skin
Waiting patiently for life to begin

The summer went away and the skies went gray
We slowly ran out of things to say
The river turned into drought
Our time was fading out

Defeated and alone, we returned back home
Like a bird without a wing who had never flown
Surrendered to, suspended dreams

Remember when
You walked away in the December wind
I felt the stinging on my pale skin
I knew that things would never be the same again

Remember when
The clouds rolled in and then the sunlight dimmed
And what will be, it killed what might have been

You always were my refuge, were my shelter
There was always a place to lay my head
And I should've taken your hand, should've held it as we stumbled
But I'd let it slip, I'd let it go instead

For I cannot give you as much as I owe you
I don't have enough love to pay my debts
I thought I'd have a plenty, but now I see I'm pretty empty
And the longer we linger the worse it gets

Ohhh...

So I'll plant fences 'round my dwelling like a garden
Wrap chains around my body like a cloak
And bite my tongue, not asking for forgiveness
For the hearts and bones and promises I broke

And I'll bite my tongue, not asking for forgiveness
For the hearts and bones and promises I broke

Don't you waste a tear for me
Don't you waste your time for me
Don't you waste yourself for me
Don't you waste a tear for me
Don't you waste your time with me
Don't

Powerful lovin'... is a dangerous kind
When I see you with your frownin' face
I've made up my mind
When you're talking and your thinking and your singing about
""Happiness was made for me""
When you're talking and your thinking and your singing about
""Why can I do differently?""
You know you got to lose shit sometimes
Do you see me as an equal baby? or something to hide?
When you're talking and your thinking and your singing about
""Love is just a game to lose""
(oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, that's fine)
Good lord, you know you've got to lose shit sometimes
There's surrender on your guilty face and pain is on mine

"
43510,"

One-Two-One-Two-Three-Four
Tell me all your stories, hypnotic sounds to my ears
I wanna know what you got in mind
Cause the way you talk girl is so fine
I'll keep dreaming of a trip to England (gotta get out of the USA)
I'll tell ya everything about me girl
Whadda you wanna know?
Yelling slurs at the referee when I take you to the football game

"

Edible plants, berries and nuts
(like the Natives used to do!)
I'm gonna live totally free, escape everything I knew
Shitting in the woods, mud on my face
I am one with Mother Earth
Yelling at the moon, eating what I kill
It's the dawn of my rebirth
Let's build a house in a town where the walls are made of grass

Treating people rude, all organic food
(like the Natives used to eat)
Telling bums that I couldn't spare a dime
Buy a paper I won't eat
Picking paint swabs out, find the darkest grout
And tile for the master bath
The demolish site was ready overnight
One last tomb to clear the path
Let's build a house over a grave made of steel, concrete, and glass

I saw someone I loved who meant so much to me
Get stripped away from me. I didn't know what to do
The doctors said he would make it through
They told me that he would make it through
Well I was just a young boy
Didn't know what to do
Just a young boy didn't know what to do
It took a long time to believe
That he was never coming back
And he could never say another word to me
I never cried so hard, the scars were dug in deep and far
I wondered where he'd be today and what he'd think of me

Something got visual KO
I dig it fast
So your gonna phone it
And then a who can not feel the same?
Chasin' tail away we go
And do you want say come
From wrongs and spills
Come home but don't stay dumb for long
Long sent home from Boston
Don't fall horsey
Don't say

We been runnin' round goin' downtown
Downtown downtown

Announce a need
It's not a form
Not a phone
He knows it ain't no location
He knows I'm on
Let him go
Let him go
Boy, yeah
Boy, you know

It ends already
It ends alright

Outside and light
Got four, no more
So bide in time
Standing sideways
Threadbare, dirty, and faded
Wax on outdated
Folded metal shown through
Sullied + simple too

Voomp-boop

How two can't do
Bright chord, no more
It's fine it's mine
Shifting simply
Joyride, cuts and I'm taken
Hold on maintain it
Like found raided its true
Shaped it and played it too

Voomp-boop

Ah one ah, ah two ah, ah three ah, ah four ah, ah five ah
Six seminal
One is short, one is low
Genuine and in a row
Folded metal shows through
Sorted + simple too

When I was younger i had the chance
To change my mind and make it right--
But I, didn't take the time

Now I'm left the sound changes
And Tom felt my own rage is said to feel like a grain outside

Dime a rate, the fine line days of mine, did you know high noon finely caught if i dont die --don't dive

Don't make it right

Go on, go out
Come on, get out
Come on
Gonna spin that ride

Don't know, what it
Gonna, be like
But i'm gonna get that right

Dont make it right

Before I said it cannot be like it did, did like it then for sometime
Didn't make it right

If were to lie, I di-d say!, get in the game, one shot away
Is that what you want, that what you say

I'm a wreck, the fine line
Did you know, days of mine behind me
Finally thought if I don't die, don't die

Go on, go out
Come on, get out
Come on
Gonna spin that ride

Don't know, what it
Gonna, be like
But i'm gonna get that right

Do you get
Feature of what you sow
Fervor a love affair
Spec to a stopping point
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Nest a weir
Fervor a love affair
It's always good, it's good to find other ways

Chorus
Wait for a wheel, will he roll-o
Time to re-learn, same as yours
Talk to them, come to hand
Will he roll-o
But at what cost, best at first

Go, but i go
Find a wire as i go
Day before another day
It's always good, good to find better ways

Chorus

Called a little
A little calm, called away
You hold and it's over
Fervor a love affair

Chorus 2X

Indian Summers
Are always awkward, I think
Warn orange air
Cold apartments
Open windows and cars
Sharing a city and basement floors
Don't waste time in case we think twice
Don't waste time, in case we think twice

Tore my shirt
Living a lie
Shed my guilt til there was no regret
Messed up a situation by not making it happen
Together on Sundays
West coast states are a dream
Don't waste time in case we think twice

Indian Summers
Are always awkward, I think
Warm orange air
Cold apartments
Open windows and cars
Together on Sundays
West coast states are a dream
Don't waste time in case we think twice

Come unglued someway
Come on calm, as to convey
Even fine, ever fair
Wait and then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know
Then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know

And to feed the one, again
To feed the one, again

Down letter, phone rang
Kinda got a roll a vote of no
Found under pressure
Gotta go, gotta go
Then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know
Then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know

And to feed the one, again
To feed the one, again

Hot Water Avalanche livin' in the water
If fun doesn't come then it won't even matter
Breathe a breath if you wanna believe and if you can't commit to it then you're tugging on it's sleeve
Fire in the episode, change what you are
What you see
What you need
What you freed
Days on the play, ground below you
Searching around for a cloud, puddles in the air
Gasping at what's out there
Above and beyond
Beneath and behind
Drivin' in the sky
Balloons in my eyes
Waiting around, laying it down
Picture something new, then forget about it...

Down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down... Lemonade?!

Apprentice, just let this engage in a bout of fitness to stage
Understand it's a challenge, don't damage a stranger, don't challenge your anger
Allow your stance in a storm to be cold
Refrain from attaching yourself to a pole
Don't ask or assume what is given to you
Stand in light or dark days
Strong or funk maze
Appellation trail phase
City with the pocket of dark and bright lights haze
Speak your mind
And let your heart gauge, how much you can say, before you know it's time

Down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down... Lemonade?!

Hot Water Avalanche livin' in the water
If fun doesn't come then it won't even matter
Breathe a breath if you wanna believe and if you can't commit to it then you're tugging on it's sleeve
Fire in the episode
Above and beyond
Beneath and behind
Drivin' in the sky
Balloons in my eyes
Waiting around, laying it down
Picture something new, then forget about it now

This crowd: a fleshy lake. The throngs as smallish waves, folds like skin upon the sow
A faint din as spit and speech caw- the rank broth that stews while boiled alive
“Who are you to cast your net so wide, and deepen the maw?
Cannibal, your hooks blood deep in hide
This too shall pass. You’ll find yourself at last.”
Couldn’t anyone else have tried to carve their hold?
The mark of hands. Couldn’t anyone else have climbed the bones of old?
The bridge of man, its steps cobbled stones from sand
One way mirror, cracked and leering, watch us crawl
A coarse ascension, a vulgar dream dragged kicking back to the floods
A crass intrusion: the eyesore tower was crashed by swarms…
A herd of cackles, a school of flesh that scorns the touch
“The only face that scorns this fate is ours: self same, ripe to faint
Once down, the stench, the taint. So raise the eyesore tower
We’ll raze the rows we felled
When stayed the hand of storms, down poured the fruit of arms.”

Lights bright
Sound loud
City streets are so clean

The trash is even so pristine
The words all move away

Words all move away
To faces like their own
The rising filth a welcome mat to
All words move away

And crawling on the floor
Has never been less fun
A dirt free proposition

All signs of those who left (2x)

Words all move away
To faces like their own
The rising filth a welcome mat to
All words move away

Just the same, they speak
The fair-haired rule this place
And all the sighs
Build up like walls
Of staggering heights
And crawling on the floor
They're move away

And crawling on the floor
Has never been less fun
A dirt free proposition

All signs of those who left (4x)

All signs of those who left (6x with more powerful instruments)

I grow where there is no soil
Yet supplanted amenable in root
In total disregard intransigent
We adhere obfuscate
We appeared from the gone
And when youre gone youre forgotten
A distant glare dissolving in shape
And when youre gone peace lay rotten
We grow where there is no water
Inviolable protected replete
In total disregard we attach parasitic
We adhere masticate disappear
And youre gone
And when youre gone youre forgotten
A rotting shell dissolving in faith
And if Im wrong youre still forgotten
We thirst where there is no water
We prey when the slaughter is done
Satiate in gluttony
The evil of all roots
And still they seek disarmingly
He dangles at my feet
For neither cross you bear
No eulogy to speak
And while they satisfy
The rest have died discreet
Why do we weep
Entrust a past worth nothing in defeat
For neither death or life
No heaven without hell light

Scream of love
The seed of evil
First you felt safe
But still you're alone
Forgotten feelings
Erased from existence
And now this world is your home
Fly with me to the end of the world
To the place where Jesus was born
He won't see he is already dead
Let's make love in the desert of sad
When the day is done
We look on the setting sun
And see all of heaven's stars
And know all the world is ours
We stand as one
As night draws near
When intentions become clear
And know that in our hearts do lie
The truth about us, you and I
So stay my love right by my side
Linger while the moon is high
And at rising of the dawn
We share one kiss and I'm gone ...
I give you one kiss
And thousands of stars fall down
Just one gentle kiss
And all the world turns around
First ray of sun
First bird in the tree makes its sound
My time has come
I leave you till dusk
Till shadow of night brings me back to my love
I'll be back
From the dead
I will take you away
We stand as one
As night draws near
When intentions become clear
And know that in our hearts don't lie
The truth about us, you and I
And know that in our hearts don't lie
The truth about us, you and I
And know that in our hearts don't hide
The truth about us and we will fly

Divine the scorn with serpent eyes
Born in the sun, live by the moon
Held with shadows dark embrace

Cancer in their hearts

Hands and knees grasping earth
The shining rust
Eggshell eyes
Brimming madness
Drink deep
The tumult fades
The silence dreams of nothing
The tree is as old as age
Branches grow, arcane fractals
Whispering to you of gentle vacuum and release
Rest your weary brow in laughing, sighing boughs
Soothe your fevers in the pulsing bark and rot
And dream of nothing
Drown your sorrows in murmurings
That fissure from gnarled growths and red earth
""The taker-away of pain...
... and the giver-back of beauty!""
Cast your eyes into your eyes
As veins and roots become one
As worlds spill from inchoate thoughts
As you fade

If only life could be this simple
I awaken the antihero
And rise to the un-occasion
Godfather of nothing am I, I, I, I
Bastard child of this fermentation
Left rotting on this vine
Life left hanging in the balance
Time left disregarded

Only one world exists
And I will dominate

My, my eyes they're god-size
My will, will never compromise

My soul it lives outside this bottle
And my spirit will always survive
And if I have breath left in these lungs
I will conquer all who dare defy, I, I, I
Alone I find my greatest strength
Weight of the world this diamond makes
Present me the challenge and I will thrive
Only one world exists and I will dominate

Simplicity exalted still
This solitude only strengthens my will

My, my eyes, my eyes
My, oh they're, they're godsize

This bottle this companion still
These pills this resistance

Spread the pressure
Spread the pain
This revolving room
This repeating strain

All the small monkeys fall
From fake trees they crawl
Into the cracks, there inside the walls
In the big heated hall
There's a sign standing tall
It reads do not feed the animals

But who knows
If it's not a fair deal
A life for a cage
Golden and clean

The lion is fast asleep
And all the cats bite their lips
Say he's too old now
To face the cold
In the big heated hall
There's a sign standing tall
It reads do not feed the animals

But who knows
If it's not a fair deal
A life for a cage
Golden and clean

Now stop for a while
And pay all your respects
Don't stare
At his face
An angry gorilla
Will bite your head off!

But who knows

People walking by us as we pass
My headphones on and
My sunglasses
Walkin' 'round I'm only roaming
Try to find my own way home and

Can you give me a reason?
Can you give me a sign?
Can you give me a signal?

And the city is freezin'
But you're all mine
Don't care about other people

Can we live
Can we live
A little longer?
Just a little longer?
Is it ending soon?
Can I be with you
Another day?
Another day?

The world is ending
Way too fast
Most things this good
They never last
Faces floating by me
Alone
I'll try to find my way home and
Can you give back my friends?
Can you give me that excuse?
I know they're trying to pretend
That they're not just like all of them
I don't think it's any use

Can you give me a good heart?
Can you give me a nice day?
Can you get rid of the the news?

Cause we all need a fresh start
Cause we all need a long stay
Cause we're all so confused

Can we live?
Can we live
A little longer?
Just a little longer?
Is it ending soon?
Can I be with you?
Another day?
Another day?

With you since we first met
But not no longer here for you
No longer here for you

How come they're still within me?

Anxiety overcome
Thoughts ruminate unwelcome
White paralysis
In a background of flesh
Reasons unresolved
Strengthen weak conduit
Flow electric
Unsettled minds hold anguish
Pinnacles pierce into fields of light
Waking slow in our hollow
Abyss we grow silent
Permeate beneath
Shadowed semblant state
Where roots embrace
Our silver inner coil
Motionless
Bearing bleeding truth

I'm in a warm cell
Inside your automatic jail
Can't say no to your game

I wanna know why
You make me feel all electrified
Can't say no to your game

I've got such high hopes
Me without you, I just can't cope
Hit the right notes, and I will never go

I'm in a warm cell
Inside your automatic jail
Can't say no to your game

Oh girl, you make me glaze
You got me dreaming every day
Can't say no to your game

I've got such high hopes
Me without you, I just can't cope
Hit the right notes, and I will never go, oh

Oh
Oh

I've got such high hopes
Me without you, I just can't cope
Hit the right notes, and I will never

I wanna know why
You make me feel so warm inside
I wanna be
Right by your side
In your eyes
Electric eyes

I'm in a warm cell
Inside your automatic jail
Can't say no to your game

I wanna know why
You make me feel all electrified
Can't say no to your game

I've got such high hopes
Me without you, I just can't cope
Hit the right notes, and I will never go

Standing on an Island
Colours to-and-fro
Staring at my leather hands
Pigeons start to go-go
Hold my baby tightly
While the bright lights gleam
Her mind starts to slip-slip
A million BLADES of light green

I, I, I, I
Glide, Glide, Glide
Baby you my boat

Sugar in my hair meltin' everywhere in the sunshine
Watch the sun go down while my face starts to crystallize
You could be the one, you could be the one who'll make me feel all right
Take me anywhere, take me anywhere, i wanna be your guy

I can't go through
Without you
It's holding me back
It's all i could do
Glazin' for you
Glazin' for you
Glazin' for you

Oh glaze!

I'm coated in love
With heat from above

I got all my fruits right here for you
Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple and even some Blue
I give them out, almost everyday
Just hold out your hand and I'll make it okay

I got all my fruits right here for you
I got so many you won't know what to do

Hey Señorita, I think that your calling for me
By the look on your face I know you like what you see
If you want more colours than you were dealt
I'll still be right here with my fruits on my shelf

I got all my fruits right here for you
I got so many you won't know what to do

Open and shut, easy ride
Can't befall on open sores

Until there's nowhere left to shift
I feel my skin melt away
I'll call you back later today
Everything that rises must resolve
Everything that rises must resolve
When I go, I go
There's nothing left to know
Nothing left to see

There's some running wild lately, rustling up the leaves
Shining light steep in the cracks that are widening everyday
And everybody knows where the master has the evidence and papers
That explains all the mysteries away

What if everybody knows
Except the few chosen ones I suppose
There's no need to dig it up, no
So we don't talk about it, we don't talk about it

Now if everyone knew the ropes that could tie themselves a knot
Every hour on the hour one thing would be for sure
The jails would go burst and the churches would be full
And the thieves would go on just the way they were

So if I turn the other cheek
Except every now and then take a peek
I can see my eyes on you, my friend
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it

Now you wonder what it sounds like when everything works out
And life is in line with the heavens and the saints
And the monkeys and the lions, and the grocers and the parents
Are all working in cahoots, might sound something like this

I've been swatting at the flies around my skull
Until I realized they were trying to talk to me
They say, you stir up the shit and you have to take away the dirt
And you're left with a whole new kind of disease

So if I turn the other cheek
Except every now and then take a peek
I can keep my eyes on you, my friend

What if everybody knows
Except the few chosen ones I suppose
There's no need to dig it up, oh no

When you stop finding reasons for everything
But tonight I'll find some answers
Down at the medicine show

I'm gonna find me that gypsy girl

Everybody wants to wonder why

[Verse One: Diego Garcia]
Stop where you are, looking up at the sun
See all the cars standing still as they run
The day starts to fade, slip away, out of sight
A flash in the sky lighting up my dark night

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
You were never there (x4)

[Verse Two: Diego Garcia]
You had it all, more than most that I know
You hide yourself behind a wall, and this shows

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Girl, you never care
You were never there
Cause you never care
You were never there

[Verse Three: Diego Garcia]
It was a rainy night in a quiet town in Florida
I stayed awake all night, couldn’t sleep at all, so I sang to her

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Girl, you never care
You were never there
Cause you never care
You were never there...

It was a rainy night in a quiet town in Florida

"
47512,
47513,"

[Verse One: Diego Garcia]
Ever since it started, girl, I always knew
From that moment, that I would love you
It was Sunday morning, the bells in the air
As I caught the shadow of your long red hair

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Roses and wine
Crimson and thyme
Roses and wine

[Verse Two: Diego Garcia]
You talk so slowly in the morning rain
I remember forever our fates the same
I knew from that moment all things must end
There is no reason for us to pretend

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Roses and wine
Crimson and thyme
Roses and wine

[Verse Three: Diego Garcia]
Tell me you love me, that's all I need to hear
Then I'll have no need to stay and I can disappear
Tell me you love me, you've never said before
Even when we were together I was never sure
I'm waiting, I'm waiting

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Roses and wine
Crimson and thyme
Roses and wine

[Verse Four: Diego Garcia]
Give me fifty reasons, I'll give you fifty more
But you never listen as you shut the door
Should I wait forever for your return?
Should I wait forever? Will I ever learn?
Will I ever learn?

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Roses and wine
Crimson and thyme
Roses and wine

"
47514,
47515,"

[Verse 1: Diego Garcia]
I walk in the night by your house again
Oh, how we both pretend
So much to defend
You offer a kiss in a block of ice
Your friends offer cold advice
Frozen and precise

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Stay, stay with me
You're my angel
Stay with me

[Verse 2: Diego Garcia]
And take me away from these lights I know
From these long nights I know
From these wrong nights I know
Look in my eyes
What you see is hell
Can you save me from myself?
Get me feeling well

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]     [x2]
Stay, stay with me
You're my angel
Stay with me

[Outro: Diego Garcia]
So take me away from these lights I know
From these long nights I know
From these wrong nights

"
47516,"

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
Under this spell can't you feel the warmth of spring?
Can't you tell none of this will mean a thing?
And the people are talking about what they're reading about
You and me, under this spell

[Verse 1]
It's in the papers and magazines
A different version with twisted scenes

[Bridge]
The lights and flashes that lead your way
The many rumors that fill your day

[Partial Chorus]
Under this spell can't you feel the warmth of spring?
Can't you tell none of this will mean a thing?

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Darling I here them coming
Why couldn't we just start running off, come on

Under this spell (x8)

"
47517,
47518,"

[Verse One: Diego Garcia]
Walking away
Now I got nothing to say
You've got me so down
It seems like you know
What I've been trying to show
You know what I've found
People can talk
Will this shit ever stop?
How can you stand it?
Come over here
You know the skies'll be clear
Right from the first kiss

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
In my heart I've got nothing to hide
In my heart I've got nothing to hide

[Verse Two: Diego Garcia]
It's hard to move on when the feelings are gone
You know that love fades

[Chorus: Diego Garcia]
In my heart I got nothing to hide
In my heart I got nothing...

[Verse Three: Diego Garcia]
Baby! You know the skies'll be clear
And, Baby! Oh, how I wish you were here!
Whoa-ah-oh-oo-ah-oh

Invisible physicians, lawyers and magicians
An instant of existence at the table in the kitchen
A flood-lit, floating highway
Headlights slicing up a pathway
Into the driveway, into the driveway
And drop me a line when you finally arrive on the runway

Southbound train-track traveler
Add another film roll, quick, into the camera

Grey lake paint-stained body of water
To the left of the runway
And drop me a line when you finally arrive

I got lost in Egypt
Wandering around the figurines a hieroglyphics
Paintings on the ceilings
Colorful in contrast to the sandy statuettes

I read the book of the dead backwards
And then I made my way to someone with a name-tag
For directions to a staircase, to a staircase

I climbed a flight and realized the century had shifted
I was awe-struck, gaping at the walls
I floated through the marble halls
Like some dis-jointed memory, thrown across the room
Like some dis-jointed memory (Thrown across the room)
Like some dis-jointed memory (Yes, I'm a little bit wasted)

Back when I pumped gas, red shirt, black pants
Drinking in the bathroom, heading for a heart-attack
Never looking up from the sidewalk
High-tops pounding out a beat in the pavement (they went)

Yes, I'm a little bit wasted
Yes, I'm a little bit wasted
Just like a six-string, I sing only when I'm pressured
Or when I'm alone with a rhythm and a reason
Heading for the season of the winter coat
Heartbeat heavy as a suicide note

Yes, I'm a little bit wasted
Nevermind, I'm fine, walking in a straight line
Trying out my voice for the first time
Yes, I'm a little bit wasted

Grey lake, paint-stained body of water
To the left of the runway
Drop me a line when you finally arrive

Where in the world i fell
I must be wrong the other way
I got a compass but i'm lost
I wonder where's my a**
As i get you again
I might not look for another friend
Loneliness is what i ment to me
Just to me
You can hit me all over my body
That i will still hand my knife
I'll bury you if i needed
I'll do anything baby
Just to be oh my!

I wanna go where the gulf breezes blow
Where there's no one to know or see
To Isla Mujeres

Just a few days in the wind and the waves
Face down in the sand and the sun
Just my baby and me

And I wanna see shoreline palms wave at me
Balmy Caribbean Bonitas
On Isla Mujeres

Yo soy un hombre que cantar las estrellas
They say you can never forget
You don't wanna go home

Si es verdad -- it's so simple it's true
I'm spending my days with the skates and rays
My nights I spend making love with you

Lobsters and clams (well I lied about the clams)
But you don't give a damn
For the city -- not London or Paris
When your on Isla Mujeres
You can be who you are 'neath the sun and the stars
Of this tropical heaven

It's a tropical heaven

(Instrumental)

All things must pass, so I've heard people say
They go back to the grind that's been killin' mankind
Since he first stood up and he stayed that way

I'm leavin' at eight
My plane's at the gate
I don't wanna be late
I don't care what the fare is
From Isla Mujeres
To New York or LA
A round trip is one way
Back to Isla Mujeres

Back to Isla Mujeres

Back to Isla Mujeres

I'm going back to Isla Mujeres

The harvestest hangover I ever had in life
I thought I'd die
Prayed for lord and cried
Tremend hallucination, black dog inside my soul
I would not know
So these tremblings go
Started swimming in a ocean
Dead ended in a cup
Another glass, play it again sam
Figured out I was a tough man
I would resist it all
I'm frantic man I know I will collapse
Heard bout smell sight followed led to
An imaginary eden for my thirst
Hell won't be ah dried
Desertized spirt, water diamonds of my heart
Pale grey green skin
God I drank my green
Started swimming in a ocean
Dead ended in a cup
Another glass, play it again sam
Figured out I was a tough man
I would resist it all
I'm frantic man I know I will collapse

Missile apocalypse harvest cannibal corpse
Can you smell it? Well it's the napalm, son
I don't know why, I don't know when
I would have lied there but there's oh lies
Bullets caressing irises
Turning to ashes the wind blows
Powerful metal tech turning to phoenix birds
I would have died there i like hold upon
I don't know why i don't know when
You would have tried it, I like to hold upon
War is peace, peace is war
Islands sinking emptying maps

Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
This is the story of eclectic prawn
He wears a little pretty crown
Dancing through the bubbles
He is now standing on the bottom of the sea
He knows his look thanks to the eyeballs
Of the fishes swimming nearby his throne
He may be fooled by those reflections
As it happens even up in the shore
Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
He's regarded like a king
Of the sea he never talked to me
I still think he is a gentleman i
Don't wanna bother him until i might
And now it's time to visit his castle

Sucking up the trails of white light
I haunt you
Miss you like a snake in the grass
Four sore winters have passed
I'll haunt you

Anyone would do
You'd count sheep with anyone

Meant for men, I'm loaded with plans
I'm cleaning clocks and hustling for time

May pull apart his frame

And some quiet time
Kiss the carpet

Stretch your legs to fill the coffin
Vacation in your clothes
Casual friday
It's all a mess
When affairs are exposed

The curtains part
The shades are flesh
Second hands turn to knives
You are buried in the nude

Invitations in the face
They suffer for the bored
Holy wars
Dark lithium

Please is this it

His brains are night trains running blind
He talked between the lines and
I could trust his speed

They were midnight rats
Chasing cabs for cash
You are young and not meant for that seen

I don't really want to die
And you do me great service
When you call my bluff
I'll stay home for hours
But it's just never enough

And I might count the hours
And bend the wire to tune
Dissect drawing circles
Or spinning in my seat
When the coach is yelling
Running through the streets

Come on let's get drunk
Drink all of our memories
Until what's left is none
That's the way it's gonna be

If you want another run
That's the way it's gonna be

Hey, do you know me now
Hey, do you like me now
Hey, do you wanna know me now
Hey, do you know me now?

"
48242,"

Morning has dawned
Now I see
You're finally gone

Why did you leave
Was I a fool
Across the hills
With crimson moon

Now I wait
Another dark night
Perhaps you'll come
Dressed in red light

Why did you leave
Why did you leave
Across the hills
With crimson moon

"
48243,
48244,"

Almost is too close
Too close for my weak body
Im so ugly when i cry
You almost killed me honey
You almost killed me honey

Armed my face with a smile
As it strugles with gravity
Haven't seen you in a while
My beautiful vanity
My beautiful vanity

"
48245,"

I can't tell you
My tongue is a dart
It will stab you
Through your lovely heart

You don't want the truth
Trust me i'm not lying
Keep your eyes closed
And keep on smiling

Keep on smiling
Keep on smiling
Keep on smiling
Keep on smiling

"
48246,"

We drink to live a 'bit more
In the name of sailors and vampires
You know love is not a whore
It's just a fake empire

We break and fall
We break and fall
How could you be so calm
We broke

You know love is not a whore
It's just a fake empire

We break and fall
We break and fall
How could you be so calm
We broke

"
48247,"

You've had blue eyes
But not as blue as the skies
Your tongue, it was too bold
Your skin so often cold

You laugh much too loud
You loved all of the control
You were much, much too proud
Oh, i think you've had it all

You were a goddess to me
You were a goddess

"
48248,"

Finally we step on the cinder
Purely made of our past
Now it's time you reconsider
How long is this gonna last

Forever she said
Forever my love she said
Forever she said

Swimming in an ocean
You're just looking at me
Don't tell me that devotion only
Can set me free

Forever she said
Forever my love she said
Forever she said

"
48249,"

You layed your eyes
On the pillow, next to mine
And they smiled
And they smiled

You whisper to me
Something unclear
Your thoughts ran through me
Oh, is this real
You disappear

Fancylad, fancylad
How did you blow your inheritance, fancylad?
Sing me your parents' embarrassment, fancylad
Sing to me your pink-flowering thorn
You never asked to be born

Your woes, they shine like tiny gemstones
What an exquisite collection, such an exquisite collection
Shall I tell you whether they're real or not
Before I cut them to perfection?
The better to bedeck you
What an exquisite collection

Fancylad, fancylad
How did you blow your inheritance, fancylad?
Sing me your parents' embarrassment, fancylad
Sing to me your pink-flowering thorn
You never asked to be born

Your wound, wherever did you find it?
Wet-petalled like a vagina
Shall I straighten this crooked boutonniere?
It shouldn't be pinned onto your coat
Plant it deep in your heart's hole
Wherever did you find it?

Fancylad, fancylad
How shall I write your biography, fancylad?
Five hundred diary pages about your dad
Sing to me your pink-flowering thorn
You never asked to be born
You never asked to be born

You'll live, you'll live, you'll live
All cried out like a girl but you'll live
Mama's little mixed-up man

You'll live, you'll live, you'll live
All cried out like a girl but you'll live
Mama's little mixed-up man

I like my coffee with black ice
You want your whiskey with a cigarette
We couldn’t be any more different
We are White Mystery
Smell all the flowers in the spring time
And autumn leaves in the fall
We meet together in the twilight
We are White Mystery
My love for you is out of sight
Silence is golden always right
Awake till dawn, shadows of night
We are White Mystery

"
48905,"

It’s making me sick
Ad vulture/ I’m so over it
All of the pop and chips/ Stuffing up the stoners and pigs, all right
Mall culture/ Subliminal tricks
Cash Multure/ We’re all a part of it
All of the useless shit/ Populating the suburbs and sticks, all right
Pain Culture/ The needles that prick
Pill pusher/ On my brother Nick
All of the capsules and scripts
Generating side effects/ Come on

"
48906,"

Blood on denim the taste of venom. The walls are shattered is it real? Does it matter, it’s worthless
Don’t know don’t no don’t know you’ll never fool me again
Dreams and visions dark decisions a call to Saturn erase the pattern it’s worthless
Don’t know don’t no don’t know you’ll never fool me again
Strife and living the cost of giving your word your honor the curse of a goner it’s worthless
Don’t know don’t no don’t know you’ll never fool me again

Smoke in the jungle fire in the forest looking for some trouble know I’m gonna find it
See a gold eagle screaming down the highway looking for some trouble know you’re going my way
Picking up the pieces going down the highway looking for some trouble know I’m gonna find it
See a gold eagle going through the forest now I take my time when they’re looking for us
Burning with my witches surfing on a heatwave stab em in the back and hide it in a black cave
Pigs and dogs are laughing at the blockade burying my hatchet in their smiling faces
Nowhere Arizona

"
48909,"

I don’t wanna be a good girl I just wanna be bad
I don’t make apologies for doing what I do best
Here’s a message for all you girls
Raise your fists up
Punch a hole in the world

"
48910,"

This is the best day I remember
Whether it’s May, June, or December
Best wishes to you again
Happy birthday to my best friend
Roses are red and violets are blue
The night is young and so are you
May all your wishes come true
Boogie down in your birthday suit
How many years does it take
To erase all of your mistakes
I dig all the things you create
Blow out the candles on your birthday cake
Happy birthday to you
Xronia Polla
Bonne Anniversaire
Alles Gut Zum Guberstag!

I have an idea Lets have a party
On the North side party On the East side party
On the South side party On the West side party

"

Well I feel so good
And I don’t know why
Well I can’t feel nothing cuz I’m dead inside
And I’m up to my eyes in dirt

Come on Summer, give me a smile
That long, cold winter lasted quite a while
Come on Summer, sweet lemonade
A skinny dip, a picnic by the lake
The green grass and the pine trees
They do me good
And the bright sun on my skin
Feeling brand new
Brand new in love with you
In love with you
Come on Summer, work your charm
A golden tan and this lovely man on my arm
Come on Summer, laughing all day
And love all night in the soft bed where we lay
Let’s go down to the beach
See the sunset sky
Our dancing mandala feet
Wash out in the tide, the tide
The tide is coming and going
The tide is coming and going
Summer Lover
You make me smile
You make me smile
Come on Summer, fill me up to my ears
With love and light to last me all through the year
Summer Lover
Summer, you do me good
You do me good

I am the Ocean;
You are the Salt in my Sea
The Cream in my Coffee
The Honey in my Tea

Maybe we should spend the summer
Maybe we should spend some time together
Under the Sun

I am the Ocean;
You are the land
My deep Devotion
Crashes on your Sand

Maybe we should spend the summer
Maybe we should spend this Life together
Under the Sun

I am the Ocean;
You are the Wind in my Sail
We drink my Love Potion
We are steep in the Gail

Maybe we should spend the summer
Baby, we should spend the winter
Under the Sun

Been so long here on this island of myself
I know each hide and
Low, and how the weather changes
My perspective, my pozition

Who I am and in what
Humankind love relation
Cosmic ocean ship...
Cosmic ocean ship...

Its hard making sence
Of ourselves and everything else
My mind, my heart, my soul felt
Loking at some photographs
O how we lived
O how we laught!
Yes, I remember happy times
Though in the minute
I could have cryed

Who am I and in what
Humankind love relation?
Cosmic ocean ship...
Cosmic ocean ship...

Love came to our table
Serving vine and bread
The wonder in your eyes
I never will forget
I never will forget

La Havana, La Havana, La Havana...

Got to face a changing planet
Weather, land, ocean and air
Population out of balance
Wages world warfare
Can we fix it with our love
Can we rise above
Got to face myself
Can I manage
Ride those emotional waves
Will I just let it happen
The crush of hours, the crash of days
Can I learn with my love
Can I rise above
The rising tide, the rising tide
Face to face with my lover
Finding recognition there
We take comfort in one another
Take time, take care
Can we live on out love
Can we rise above
The rising tide, the rising tide

I like to stay home
You go on out just close the door
I like to stay home
Where it's safe and sound
And nobody has a rifle
I don't care about going anywhere
I don't think about appearing anywhere
I got enough to do right here
I like to stay home
Relax and read the facts of life
I like to stay home
Where it's safe and sound
And nobody asks me what's wrong
I don't care about movies or hockey games
I just need about
Why is it jabberwocky blames me?
I got enough to do right here
I like to stay home
And play guitar and play it back
I like to stay home
Where it's safe and quiet
In private inside me
I think i'll stay home
I don't care about making any plans
I don't think about showing up at the dance
Go without me got enough to right here
I like to stay home
You go on out and have a ball

Listen to some tunes

Play myself some music

Oh, what could I do?
My life is a bore, just lay down on the floor
Listen to some songs

Play myself some music
Listen to side 3 first
Play myself some music
Pretend I did not lose you

A ballad makes me think of you
And a rocker makes me think of us
But silence makes me cry

I got all these records, but it's such a chore to choose one
But I must play the game, get settled in the phones

I am stupid, you are smart
Getting ignored just breaks my heart
Thinking in the auto, where am I at?

Scared to death, you will not react
I don't wanna know the reaction to that

Conflict of interest
I ain't gonna quit
Conflict of interest
I ain't gonna change
There's a conflict of interest
I won't improve
I can't, no I can't
I don't know how

What is the reason for this grief?
Is my personality too deep?
You might say I'm wasting my time
Trying to solve this inhuman crime

Send me back to Maplewood, get me a job
Write apologetic letter to Bob
Anything is better than singing this song
Nothing is right but something is wrong

[Chorus]
There's a conflict of interest
I ain't gonna quit, no
Conflict of interest
I ain't gonna change
Conflict of interest
I cannot improve
There's a conflict of interest

I don't know how to

SM: What is it that you do exactly, and what are some noteworthy moves you’ve made in your career?

VB: I am the Urban Music buyer for the TransWorld chain of stores. We are the largest music chain in the business. I came to TransWorld from The Wherehouse. I have been working in music over 35 years. Here are a few facts. I was a DJ for 26 years, managed artists worked as an A&R consultant for several labels, Executive Produced several albums. One of them was in Billboards Top 10. Produced a film. I was in The Source Magazine POWER 30 for 5 consecutive years. I won a Living Legends award through their foundation. I have been able to meet just about every important artist over the last 35 years. I even had a dinner with Nelson Mandella. I was very instrumental in the careers of numerous artists. I love helping new artists achieve their dreams. I have been very involved with so many artists through the years but the one that really will remain in my heart is TECH N9NE & now Cognito.

SM: What do you think about Cognito and his music?

VB: Cognito is one of the best lyricists out there. He is so dedicated to his craft. He is highly creative & hard working. I think his music is very current, clever and infectious. His flow and delivery will stand up to just about any MC in the game today. If you look at Strange Music’s roster of artists you will see that they are picky about who they sign. They look for unique and credible talent, and that is just what Cognito is all about. When you listen to his music you do not have to figure out what he is talking about. He is very direct and spits lyrics that most people can relate to. You can tell by his tracks that he is influenced by many genres of music. I listen to hip hop all day long as a buyer and I hear absolutely EVERYTHING. When Cognito’s music came across my desk, I knew I had to know him, work with him and hear as much of his music as possible. Just like Strange, I am also picky these days about the people I work with….WORKING WITH COGNITO WAS A NO-BRAINER. This is something I HAD TO DO. I am a HUGE fan of Cognito.


SM: How did you guys meet?

VB: Cognito worked for the oldest and best indie distributor out of the Bay Area. I knew him as the guy that got the job done right when I needed help from that company. I could always depend on him. His work was incredible. Then one day he mentions that he is also a rapper. So naturally I wanted to hear his music, although I was a little scared because most of the time the music was just not great from so many others through the years. He sent me some of his music & I flipped out. I ran around from office to office in my building playing it for people. I could not believe that he dropped this gem on me. Needless to say, his disc went from my office, to the car and to my home and then traveled everywhere with me. I could not stop listening to him. His demo became a hit with myself and quite a few of my friends. It kind of reminded me of how I felt when I first heard Tech. My next step was calling Strange Music.

SM: What do you think are some features that set Cognito apart from the rest?

VB: Well, music is very personal for people and for my taste it is all in his music. Remember, I hear everything so if I can get the enjoyment out of a Cog disc that I get from some of the greatest rappers of today, I know he can stand up and really fit in the game. Although he is from the Bay, his music could be felt anywhere. He has a different style and sound from most of the Bay area rappers. He is definitely more clever than most rappers I am hearing these days. He represents a regular guy, that is not concerned with flash and flossin’. He loves hip-hop with every ounce of his body so he is much more concerned with spittin great lyrics than all of the other stuff that usually comes with a career in this game. After working with rappers for so many years I can also say that his hard work and work ethics also set with apart from the rest. He is loyal and very dedicated to his family and friends. When you see his live show, you will see for yourself why he stands out from the rest.

SM: You rub shoulders with many of hip-hop’s elite, what made Cognito someone worthy of your backing?

VB: Listen to his music and you will know but it was also his intelligence. He was already smart about the business and he was hard working and very honest with me. He did not have some crazy ego. He was as good, if not better than some of the other (rap-stars) that I helped throughout the years. I just could not turn my back on his level of talent.

SM: You’ve worked with Strange a lot in the past few years. What do you attribute to their success? How do you think Cognito will be a good fit?

VB: This is plain, simple and easy to say……THE GREATEST RAPPER OF ALL-TIME, TECH N9NE AND THE GREATEST MANAGER OF ALL-TIME TRAVIS O’GUIN. With TECH’S music and the work ethic, professionalism, creativity and mind of Travis they are unstoppable. Tech has been through a lot through the years, he has been connected to some of the greatest minds and people in the business so he has learned a lot along the way but the education that he has received at Strange just makes him stronger and stronger with every release. I work with EVERY label and there is NONE FINER THAN STRANGE MUSIC. These guys know what they are doing and they do it with style, creativity and a hell of a lot of HARD WORK. No other rapper is touring as much as TECH. When one tour ends, another starts and people are there ready to buy ticket after ticket because his live show is the VERY BEST YOU WILL SEE. Cognito will fit in just fine because he can keep up with the tour schedule & give an amazing show to the THOUSANDS OF TECH AND STRANGE MUSIC FANS. The Strange Music logo has become a major force in Hip Hop and I think they may be extending that to other genres in the near future. They are selective about who they sign and I am glad, proud and ecstatic that they have brought Cognito into their elite roster of artists. When you see their logo on a piece of music you can bank on it being great. They are the new face of the business!

Like a knife come to slit my ties to the past
To all the things which bind me to the grave, you came
You came in the morning after a long night
You came in the morning after a dark night

I stared into the knife. to see if it would hurt me
Threaten my life, use me and desert me
To a decision, I came
I came in the morning after a long night
I came in the morning after a dark night

I took the knife, slid it under my belt
Was so surprised at the joy I felt
To come out of the mourning, I Came
I came out of the mourning after a long night
I came out of the mourning after a dark night

Like a knife come to slit our ties to the past
To all the things which bind us to the grave, we came
We came in the morning alter a long night
We came in the morning after a dark night

Digital, binary system, ones and zeroes, dark Versus light
Yin and yang, x and y, my mother and my father made me one night

In the beginning, a murky mass of hydrogen helium
Voted to organize into higher elements
Carbon nitrogen and oxygen, protons electrons collide

Digital, binary system, ones and zeroes, dark versus light
Yin and yang, x and y, my mother and my father made me one night

Forbidden fruit rotting on the vine
Forbidden fruit turning to wine. Intoxicating
Nakedly we lay in an ecstatic embrace, trying not to come too quickly
One minute rise, plastic bagged lubricated safety tube

This is not a through street; one cannot pass here
But where me and you meet to graze the divine pastures
This is not a through street; one cannot pass here
But run and jump with two feet
And break through all the matter

Throw your body to the edge of crisis
Paralysis is everywhere
Throw your body to the edge of crisis
Paradise is everywhere

Digital, binary system, ones and zeroes, dark versus light
Yin and yang, x and y, my mother and my father
In me still fight, in me unite

And everybody knows

First you told us only through you could we know God
And if we dared to question then He wouldn't spare the rod
For you we worked the soil, for you we dug the moors
For you we shed our blood and fought so many pointless wars
And now you build your fences and say there's nothing we can do
You say the world around us belongs fairly to the few
But about six billion people no doubt will agree
This world is our home, not your property

It's the commons, our right of birth
And to you who would enclose the land all around the Earth
Our future is your downfall, when we cut this ball and chain
You who'd sacrifice the public good for your private gain

With our sweat we built the railroads, built cities on these shores
But because you own the money you say that it's all yours
We laid the phone lines and the pipelines and then right before our eyes
You say these things our taxes paid for you now will privatize
Privatize the hospitals, privatize the schools
Privatize the prisons for all those who break your rules
And preparing for the day when all the wells run dry
You say you own the very rain that falls down from the sky

But it's the commons, our right of birth
And to you who'd own the water all around the Earth
Our future is your downfall, when we cut this ball and chain
You who'd sacrifice the public good for your private gain

You claim to own the harvest with your terminator seeds
You claim to own the genomes of every animal that breeds
You claim to own our culture and the music that we play
And with every song we download to your coffers we must pay

You would even own my name and you say it's for the best
Maybe you'll let us on your radio stations if our songs can pass your test
You own country, you own western, you say you've given us a choice
You may own the airwaves but you'll never own my voice

It's the commons, our right of birth
And to you who'd own the music all around the Earth
Our future is your downfall, when we cut this ball and chain
You who'd sacrifice the public good for your private gain

It's the commons, our right of birth
And to you who would own everything all around the Earth
Our future is your downfall, when we cut this ball and chain
You who'd sacrifice the public good for your private gain

Make a wish on whispered stars
For a road and faster car
And wait, see if it comes true
For a house on distant streets
Dream of nights in softer sheets
This beach, will wait
So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide
And at next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home
Let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side
I'm on your side
When weather's right
Come sailing home again
Walk the land and see the shore
Think of less and want for more
And wait, to keep the grey from blue
In a house on distant streets
Someone dreams a distant beach
And waits, they wait
So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide
And at next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home
Let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side
I'm on your side
When weather's right
You'll see it swept away
You'll see it swept away
So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide
And at next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home
Let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side
I'm on your side
When weather's right
You'll see it swept away
You'll see it swept away
You'll see it swept away

Ever since a modern man
Made himself an iron hand
I was trapped inside again
Trying to get out
Oh won't you take me to the hill?
Put me in your Coupe de Ville
Tell me that you love me still
We could get out of here

[Chorus]
Oh, life is a story
Won't you be my story, girl?
Your eyes are blue skies

[Verse 2]
We could eat the tasty pieces
Of the peaches on the beaches
Tell me what would be such fun
Sitting in the garden sun
And you could go and meet my mom
We could sit there all day long
Tell me what would be so wrong
Oh so wrong with that?

[Chorus]
Oh, life is a story
Won't you be my story, girl?
Your eyes are gold skies
That shows them the sunrise
And you saw nothing
You made me so happy!

Oh, life is a story
Won't you be my story, girl?
Your eyes are bloodshot

The garbage is piled up way too high
I wouldn't blame you if you leave
It's not the way your world's supposed to be

And when the coals are on your seat
And it's taking all of me to breathe
I tell you run but you stay right here

Just like the taste behind my teeth
And like the bullet in my knee

And like the aching in my aching hands

With a garden outside
You should see it sometime
But don""t, don't worry about

This is the last night in the house I was born in
Don""t tell me that i have forgotten who I am
I'm gonna write, write, write
Until it comes out wrong

And I know that you always wanted me to

And ill tell myself that things you said you said just because you had to

Next to my head
Swallow the key up
Swallow the key

Take this
Go on
Take it
And you'll see your ache will soon break
Do this in memory of what you used to be
But that lump on the cot in a dark room
Takes her time wasting away
Trapped inside of a body that hates her
Take your time
And then someone will take you

'Cause i've seen dark
And I can not write it
I see dark
I know you are tired
Of fighting

We'll lay with the lights out
I'll lie if you want me to
But i will lie next to you

I can hear them too

Scrape these barnacles
I am whole again
Finally purified
Or whatever that means
Put your back in it

Free me
From their teeth
But dont cut too deep

Scrape these barnacles
I am utterly yours
Take my lack of control
And swallow it whole
Break my excuses to leave
Over your boney knees
And scrub the sweat away
Make me clean

Please pull the bad dreams out of me

Scrape these barnacles

Take my lack of control
And swallow it whole
Break my excuses to leave
Over your boney knees and

Free me
Free me

And you haven't left yours in 100 hours
And we can't keep our hands
Out of our own mouths
See the horrible habits we acquire
And all the rawest thumbs
From gnawing on them
And rowing hard

You're a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
You're a nervous wreck

And how my stomach burns
But only at night
When the moon is bright
And I have dreams about bears
With the reddest mouths
But your arms are warm
And your legs are wrapped around
And the sound of your heart
The unsteady sound

I will slow it down

I sold my blood to a hospital
but it wasn't very much blood
so they didn't give me much money,
they didn't give me much.

I thought that you might like this
because it's got a shine to it
I know you like shiny things so I will try to buy it up for-
and drive to you.
I posed unclothed
for an artist in his home
but i couldn't hold it long enough
and he didn't like my body much
so he didn't give me much.

I thought that you might like this

Beets bleed and tables have legs
I boiled up a feast
And the table it ran away a bloody mess
I need to stop singing in code
To start ringing true only
Because true rings only

Keep away from me
I am full of terrible things

Elbows, elbows and knee pads
Can you believe that that I still need them?
Scissors in window boxes
I buried three pairs
Can you see how hard it is?

Keep away from me
I am full of terrible things

My lazy shape is armed in dirty clothes
My arms are worn and scarred with beauty marks
So they can tell my lazy shape apart
From other shapes with hearts and human parts

Beware
Where I am is where
The channels run bare
The canals run bare
And there's much to be scared from
That didn't wash up til everything dried up

Keep away from me
I am full of terrible things
But if you love the terrible
Then please be near to me

You are an immaculate girl, sent from above
You are everything that I want, my love
My heart is filling up
I am alive
A raisin reattached to the vine
Revived
Won't you crawl into my bedbedbedbedbedbed?
I will thee wed
You are a miraculous song in my head
We live in difficult times
I fell behind
I did some shit that I can't deny
But you are a merciful girl
You helped me back
You cut my hair, and you cut me slack
Won't you crawl into my bedbedbedbedbedbed?
I will thee wed
You are a miraculous song in my head
Your eyes do a thing where they talk
You turn me on
I can't always say what I want... hold on
I am a tenuous man, eroding sand
But you are an impetuous girl
Oh man. Amen
Won't you crawl into my bedbedbedbedbedbedbedbed?

Yeah, wish I could be where you are
I know the distance is far
I've been running, running through your mind
Promise that I'm on a flight, going to you right now
I don't have much time, with you tonight
I've been going, I've been going, I've been focused
Just be with me in the moment
Trust me I know how you feel right now
Baby that's just what it is right now
Just stay with me, right behind you
And I'm trying to, make the time to
Baby that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now, yeah, yeah

It doesn’t matter
It all makes sense for all I know
It’s the same thing that has come that will go
I tried to speak up
(most of the time I was muzzled by a joke)
But inspiration took a break and I choked

I said I’d give an eye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d be the catcher in the rye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d fight and die for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d steal the sun from the sky for you
But that was just a lie
I just closed my eyes for you

It’s just a cycle
Didn’t we all find out long ago?
From Hemingway to The Crystals
From de Sade to Sade
It doesn’t matter
It all makes sense for all I know
Those starry eyes will glisten
Till the waves reach the cove

I said I’d give an eye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d be the catcher in the rye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d fight and die for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d steal the sun from the sky for you
But that was just a lie
I just closed my eyes
I only closed my eyes
I just closed my eyes for you

Made it through the winter
Without noticing
A different kind of beaty
That ruins everything
Almost screaming
Lying and waiting
Have no doubt we will
Surely relate to what we are becoming

It's become a culture
Escaping the fatigue
Takes the place of nothing
Makes nothing obsolete
Waiting for the morning
Patience is boring
Have no doubt we will
Surely find something worth exploring

An fragrance influential fragrance
A lingering relief
Regressing back to habits
Seductions always brief
Almost screaming
Movements repeating
Almost screaming
Movements repeating

Waiting for the morning
Patience is boring
Have no doubt we will
Surely find something worth ignoring

Based loosely on logic, it turned us lethargic

Frag mich warum ist die Nacht favorit
Warum zieht es mich in Gassen, diese Frau ist auf Speed
Woran das liegt, weil sie Nächte lang zieht, sie flieht, kniet, genießt und liegt
Paranoia schiebt
Sie will raus aus sich, rein in das Nachtlicht
Entjungfert in Disko's auf Rauschgift und glaubst das nicht
Das Gesicht ist unbezahlbar, denn jeder Scheiß zählt weil parra ist machbar

Don't Let Me Out – Matt Bauer

I killed you and thought that that was that
But right away your ghost comes back
And I can't get my hands around it
No I can't get my hands around you
Uh huh

My leg is caught up in a trap
I licked the blood and I stopped to nap
And I dream
Yeah I dream about you
Well I have seen you
But I tend to doubt you
Uh huh

Girls jumpin off the new river bridge
The water rushes up to them
And their hair
Floats up to heaven
And it's so pretty
Well I can't stand it
It's so pretty
Well I can't take it
Uh huh

Oh there you are at the magic theater
Black dress, hands up, in the air
Well I've heard
Yeah I've heard about this
Time to time, thought I'd seen it
Uh huh

Oh the show is over, everybody's gone
The air was cool, and the pines were long
And draped down, from the blackness
Mmm mmm mm mmm

Oh you saw my coffin and got right in
Took a hammer in your hand
And you knocked those nails right out of it
Yeah you knocked those nails right out of it
But I'm sayin no, don't let me out
No, don't let me out

Nothing from a schoolboy taught me right from wrong
Education's dead
I knew the answer, but had all the questions wrong
Somebody's head they said
I didn't see it happen
I didn't have a clue
In somebody else's body with someone else's head
In somebody else's body when I was someone else instead
In somebody else's body with someone else's head
When you're in somebody else's body in someone else's bed

A revolution came and left today
Nobody knew
It came and went, and so did Judgement Day
It's really nothing new
I didn't read the papers
I didn't watch the news, no
In somebody else's body with someone else's head
In somebody else's body when I was someone else instead
In somebody else's body with someone else's head
When you're in somebody else's body in someone else's bed

Ooh, baby, you are everything to me, but sometimes I need more
Ooh, and lately it seems the more I get the more I just keep lookin' for
So tell me what's the use
So tell me now, tell me what the use is when it's over
It's over, it's over when you're
In somebody else's body with someone else's head
In somebody else's body when I was someone else instead
In somebody else's body with someone else's head

At least I want her to be
How could something so good just have to be
So fragile?
All the birds are singing
High up in the trees
Now she's gone I'm feelin the breeze

There's no more time
Death's gonna come as it pleases
So give me back my fantasy
Give me back my better day

Imagine
We're fragile (hopeless)

I guess it's time I was leaving
Honey, think of me
Three thousand feet up and flying free

There's no more time
Death's gonna come as he pleases
So give me back my fantasy
Give me back my better days

Imagine
We're fragile

And whenever you think of me
Can you picture me in my robe?
My vacation in Tokyo
Whatever we had was gone
And it helps when you change the scene
I can't really say for how long
My vacation in Tokyo
My vacation in Tokyo

Turn your back on me (x3)

Will you drag me down, will you see just who I am

She is here with the damned and the dying, destroyer of the sons of Mars
This is where there are no angels
This is where all hope is dead

She is free in her sanctuary, the secret place the church can't find
Where she is free to touch some evil
Where she is free to lose her mind

Messalina. The flames are rising
Messalina. It feels like she's dying
Messalina. She has damned herself, forever with her own hand

Alone again with her prince of darkness, with his kiss of pure electric fire
Alone again with her fallen angel
Alone again with the Lord of the Flies

Messalina. The flames are rising
Messalina. It feels like she's dying
Messalina. She has damned herself forever with her own hand

Messalina. The ecstasy took her
Messalina. Temptation broke her
Messalina. Defiled herself in a moment of weakness

Through the veil and into the vortex
This is where the monsters are
Into the gaping jaw of hell; now into the breach, the time is now

Messalina. The flames are rising
Messalina. It feels like she's dying
Messalina. She has damned herself forever with her own hand

Messalina. The ecstasy took her
Messalina. Temptation, it broke her
Messalina. Defiled herself in a moment of weakness

Messalina. She's alone in her room now
Messalina. She's lost in her madness
Messalina. No one can save her now

Messalina. Now the gate is open
Messalina. She's unleashed the devil
Messalina. She's lost in evil now

Take my hunger
Break my anger
Steal all madness
Slake my thirst
Take my hunger
Break my anger
Steal all madness
Slake my thirst
Your love is crashing through my veins
Your heat has far eclipsed the day
Let naught but hunger take the pain
We've lived as those who've lived for fame
Take my hunger
Break my anger
Steal all madness
Slake my thirst
All those who would condemn our love
Know not the beauty in your sun
We'll live for that which must be done
Release the bird to soar above
Take my hunger
Break my anger
Steal all madness
Slake my thirst
Your love is crashing through my veins
Your heat has far eclipsed the day
Let naught but hunger take the pain
We've lived as those who've lived for fame
Take my hunger
Break my anger
Steal all madness
Slake my thirst. (x9)

Out of the darkness, hell unbound
One thousand miles above the ground
With eyes of lust and heart of fire
She's everything you will desire

Night Angel, she's coming for you
Night Angel, now take the torment
Night Angel, she's here for you now

From the Abyss and from the dead
She is coming for your bed
Descending from the storm above
She will break your heart with love

Come and lay down in the meadow
Rest your head amongst the flowers
Come and sip the sacred poison
Fly away on the wings of madness

And they were once known as angels from the sky and heaven
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters

Chariot of psilocybe
Take me up to ride the lightning
Can you hear their feet a'dancing
Can you hear their voices singing?

And they were once known as angels from the sky and heaven
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion
Let them fill your head with thunder

On a toadstool painted scarlet
Sits a queen, a faery harlot
She will lead if you will follow
Down the road that leads to sorrow

From the Dreamworld she is calling
Come to me, come running, falling
Come and sip the sacred poison
Come and sip my sacred poison

And they were once known as angels from the sky and heaven
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion
Let them fill your head with thunder

And they were once known as angels from the sky and heaven
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion

The fire of love, burn ever higher
The fire of love, heed my desire
The fire of love, flame never dying
The fire of love, born of my sighing

You are my daylight
You my endless night
You are my firelight
You the stars so bright

You are what's yet to be
You are my memory
In war and raging sea
You will defend me

The fire of love, stay close beside me
The fire of love, burning inside me
The fire of love, give and take freely
The fire of love, never deceive me

Love ascending, love eternal
Love transcending life. It can never die
Love and laughter, pain and sorrow
Love lives after life

Take me with you, we have forever
In love we two, we'll be together
Wrapped in your arms, I am much braver
With strength and charm, you are my savior

Love ascending, love eternal
Love transcending life
Love and laughter, pain and sorrow
Love lives after life, and death

She has fled the fields of green
Where life was pure in a rustic dream
Where her first love carved his name in the bark
And gave to her his soul and heart

Now she sells her body to the night
Underneath the neon lights
And if she's lucky she's got five years
Of crack, smack, pain and tears

City of the Dead
City of the Dead will crush your dreams
City of the Dead will clip your wings
City of the Dead is here to break you
City of the Dead is here to make you

Gone forever the meadow of rye
Youthful lust beneath the summer sky
Her sweetheart died a suicide
When he lost his love to the Temple of Lies

Twenty six months, she's grown old
Bled to death on the streets of gold
A raggedy whore she will die
And burn in the flames of paradise

"
52360,"

She has come from the shadows of the dream world
A dark angel from the darker side of love
Across a sea of tears
A hundred thousand years
Come with her and dance in the moon light
And you are lost to this world evermore
Put your hand in her hand
Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!
Come and drown in the lake of her passion
Come and die so you can be reborn
Hear the siren sing
Hear the death knell ring
She's a witch, a siren, and a vampyre
She has come from the distant stars
To take your heart
To break your heart
Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!
Come and kiss, kiss the lips of Lilith
Come and kiss, and you will be no more
Feel the fire
Of desire
Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!
Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!

At the Nymphaeum you can lose your mind
You can lose all time and damn yourself to love
At the Nymphaeum you can have it all
You can be reborn, and damn yourself to love

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum
Give your soul up to lust

At the Nymphaeum you shall have the truth
You shall have your youth, damn yourself to love
On a summer night, perfume in the air;
Desire is everywhere, damn yourself to love

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum
Give your soul up to lust
Be consumed in the ecstasy
Drown yourself in sexual fire

At the Nymphaeum, and underneath the stars;
Sink into the dream, damn yourself to love

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum
Give your soul up to lust
Be consumed in the ecstasy
Drown yourself in sexual fire

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum
Give your soul up to lust
Be consumed in the ecstasy
Drown yourself in sexual fire

Fall as a fool to the lunacy
Underneath the summer moon
Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum
Paradise is here and now

The bloom of youth
Shone from her lovely face
A rose against her skin
Would not seem out of place

This silent succubi
Had men enwrapped in dreams
Such sweet seducers
Are never what they seem

The rage of unloved wives
Would seal this beauty's fate
Many years of fading looks
Brought bitterness and hate

A man of god must ensure
Justice will be done
For Satan dwells within
The black heart of this one

I can't believe you keep comin' 'round
When it's so clear I just bring you down
You're all alone 'cause you choose to be
Please, don't pretend it's to do with me

You wanna be out
Away from your noose
You wanna be free and
You wanna be loose

You haven't the backbone
To handle the truth
I'm telling you, girl
You're just an excuse

I wonder what it's like to be you
Every day barely getting through
Mother's advice hanging by a thread
The world out here ain't what's in your head

You gather your lies
You make a great wall
You teeter atop it
And try not to fall

I tried to help you
But still you refuse
You've done it now girl
You're just an excuse, now

You wanna be out
Away from your noose
You wanna be free and
You wanna be loose

I wish there was something
I could do for you
Unfortunately
You're just an excuse

"
52548,"

Well, you're not gonna break my heart
'Cause my heart ain't what I'm givin' to you
And I'm not gonna beg for yours
'Cause that's not what I am here to do

You're not faithful but you're true
And I don't know what to do
'Cause it never bothers me
When you're where you need to be
Oh no

I mean what do I expect
To put a rope around your neck
And just declare you property
Well babe, you know it isn't me
Oh no

And I can't just estimate
When it's gonna be too late
You do what you wanna do
And I'll just do the same thing too
Oh yes

And if we go our separate ways
I won't say we was too late
'Cause we never were on time
And babe, you never weren't mine
Oh no

"
52549,"

Would you want me on fire?
Would it help you to see?
'Cause I can tell what it looks like
When you're talkin' to me

Were you ever a baby?
Were you ever a child?
'Cause I was ready, you were there
That was all

In you all I see is a skeleton
Your skin on blood, baby
Your blood on bone

"
52550,"

Sister, just give up your lies
Trust, I'm on your side
It might be a big surprise
But we've nothing to hide

'Cause I want what I want
Tonight
One by one
All right

Brother, just lay down your arms
I'm not here to fight
Long as we know what is wrong
Both of us are right

"
52551,"

It sets me off to see the people
Always so easy to play
I'd rather keep my head down
Carry out the rest of my day
Somethin' 'bout the way that
People love their harm
I've got an eye for trouble
And that's what keeps me up in arms
You've got this thing about you
That keeps me on the edge of my seat
'Cause every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

It bothers me to notice
But it sure seems you like that game
Surprises me every time
But really it's just the same
You handle everything and everyone
With that velvet glove
But when you take it off
I can see your skin is not enough
There's something there about you
Like an animal ready to feed
And every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

Speak a little softer now
Or maybe just use your eyes
Pull her in around you
Using love as your disguise
There's danger in everything
You say and do
I guess we're not so different
And that's what makes me blue
The funny thing about it is
I know you got what I need
When every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

Yeah every time you smile I can tell

"
52552,"

If I'm ever on your mind
It's a slow disease
Corrosive and behind
Closed doors you're on your knees

When you're the worst there is
There's nothing to fear
That's why you and I are here

Have you ever been afraid
Of all that couldn't be?
Just spending all your time
Pretending that you're free

I can offer some reprieve
But it won't cure your ill
So weigh out the little time
That you have before the kill

"
52553,"

Bet you never met yourself a little girl like me
Every single day it gets easier to believe
When I come at you your bones just fall apart
Give me your hand, let's make a new start

You never say
Just who you are
Let yourself go, my little girl
And you'll go far

Everything about you screams, I wanna disappear
But something keeps you around and that's why you're here
I'm not a stupid girl, I'm not your enemy
Get yourself together and then set yourself free

"
52554,"

There was a time
When I would have jumped at
Anything you said

But you took too long
To pay attention
Now that dog is dead

Too late, too late
Old as the moon and stars
Too late, too late
Stay right where you are

You're the pebble in my shoe
I tell ya
You won't just let me be

So I just hide
And watch your face
While you're lookin' for me

"
52561,
52562,"

You're a lot like me
And I think that you should tell her
That the only difference between us is fear

And if you are like me
Then I think you should remember
If you ever wanna get yourself outta here

Now all you think
You hide are open secrets
And the pendulum swings back and forth, my dear

Don't believe
Everything you hear
Gather all you cherish
And keep it quite near

I can be your friend
Or I just just go and break you
And I think you'd better make what you want clear

'Cause I'm not quite sure
How long it's gonna take you
If you really wanna get yourself outta here?

The moon lies and says ""that is alright""
I believed before and I felt fine
Despair holds my hand as I walk
Do I need her here, It wouldn't work

This feeling fades as you move on
You'll look for peace but nothing works
Life is gone and you don't want to know
Don't you know that time has come along

I can't replace the face I hide
We travel on a line of light
Silver leafs, electric lights
Bright eyed smiles, all madness and lies

The noise that fascinates me, you
The noise that fascinates me, it's you
The noise that fascinates me, you
You turned it off

It's not over
Over is the day you give up

Not unlike three leaf clover
Unlucky until you give it thought
I will never be sober
I'll leave before you can help

It's not over
Over is the day you give up

Every day is another day my parents get older

Every day is another day I will not see my friends
Every day is another day wasted breathing smog

It's not over
Over is the day you give up

A long time to wait
To not get any closer

All the time
Coming down is all I see
Cold day in November
It was 1983

Wait for days
Lying on the airport seat
Holding on to your image
For as long as I could keep

Coming down

Sky around
Tumble down
Bring us home
Along the ground
Send love to mom
Take my place

Failure to
See the many traps around
The light of just one person
One lapse and then you're gone

Always I
Can't feel the first impact
We hold onto your fear
And take your pain away

Wait for days
Lying on the airport seat
Holding on to your image
For as long as I could keep

Coming down

Sky around
Tumble down
Bring us home
Along the ground
Send love to mom
Take my place
Make it safe

Push the clouds up in the sky
Gravity fades as you fly
Let them take on your eyes
Yes the battle is over
It's time to go

Feel all the love that lives in your heart
These are the words that keep us apart
Try to become the one that you are
I will not be here but I won't go far

Everyone's got a few to bear
Hold up the stars with your hands
Midnight black it pushes down
Just enough strength to break a hole
Go on, slide through and catch your soul

Feel all the love that lives in your heart
These are the words that keep us apart
Try to become the one that you are

I will not be here but I won't go far

Too late to look back now
What if I'm wrong?
Don't let your last breath of air keep you down
Don't let your rockets fail
Just look around

Where will you fall?

Feel all the love that lives in your heart
Everyone has got to fear
These are the words that keep us apart
Never been so crystal clear
Try to become the one that you are
Don't let the last breath keep you down
I will not be here but I won't go far

What happened to your eyes?
Plastic lenses, plastic skies
Above it all, you're standing tall
Behind you left it all

Don't look down now

Pretend that it's over
You'll never be closer
You know where you came from

Go on and on and on and on

Blame it on the shining stars
Lost in space, you look so far

What really makes you feel so happy?
When you find out, we'll still be here

Don't look down now

Pretend that it's over
You'll never be closer
You know where you came from
Ignore those that made you

Go on and on and on and on

It's so weird i still live here
It's so weird i still know you
So weird i still love you
So weird i'm still alive

Every day i awake
And i'm truly amazed
I made it another day

I'm too afraid to kill myself
And too afraid to really live

Every day is the same
Every night is the same
So weird i ended up here

Every kiss is the same
Every love is the same
So weird i ended up here

So weird i still lie here
So weird i can't talk
So weird i can't move
So weird i'm still alive

If i were to leave this place
Tonight and not turn back
I'd end up where i started

I'm too afraid to kill myself
And too afraid to really love

Every day is the same
Every night is the same
So weird i ended up here

Every drug is the same
Every fight is the same
So weird i never change

Every kiss is the same
Every love is the same

Every day is the same
Every night is the same
So weird i never change

Every night is full of muted white
A faint reflection, a faded sunrise
Dew coated sill, pale blue sky
Warmer weather keeps the sleds all dry
Muffled laughter and joyful screams
They're all gone by the time dawn breaks the seams

Locked inside, bound and tied
Someday I will go down Hospital Hill

Every day is full of radiant black
A blazing shadow, a burning twilight

You write your name in the frost covered window
Bright sunny glare covers pure white snow
Ablaze when darkness fell
Fiery when all's not well

Can you see just over the hill
Melted snow, can't keep still
I found a way to keep myself together
Never sleep in the month of December

Dark forward get cold
Let go and come down

Tonight it's your favorite shirt
The wind ain't hard but its calm
Let go and come down

It's possible I might miss you
If not when will it again
I burned, you turned, I learned, why
Why, why not, why, why
You got to feel it tonight

Blow hot and blow cold
Play fast and loose
Take it to head

A bit in the teeth
Fits- and starts
At your sweet will
Not counting the cost
Let go and come down

I can tell you, this is everything
Thrown and sleeveless, in and did some things
I burned, you turned, I learned, why
Why, why not, why, why
You got to feel it tonight

It's possible I might miss you

On the wane it's up, game out feel like going home now
Fails and turns to luck, words aren't making it it seems
Whip hand and joint fire, fire
Cut the ground better day
Nest about out from under one

Now the laugh is up, struck about, grapple up and down
Hip hustle and higher fire
On a cloud turn it round down is sealed be all up and on

They don't get on
We all fall down
We dont get up
If We all fall down
Get up get on
We all fall down, down, down, down

We dont get on

Get up get on
If we all fall down
They don't They don't
We all fall down, down down, down

Like I'm feeln no, no'kay maybe comin out soooo right
Pick and fixin a fire now I'm---
By the hip, standing still, moving out going round and round

They don't get on
We all fall down

When I was younger i had the chance
To change my mind and make it right--
But I, didn't take the time

Now I'm left the sound changes
And Tom felt my own rage is said to feel like a grain outside

Dime a rate, the fine line days of mine, did you know high noon finely caught if i dont die --don't dive

Don't make it right

Go on, go out
Come on, get out
Come on
Gonna spin that ride

Don't know, what it
Gonna, be like
But i'm gonna get that right

Dont make it right

Before I said it cannot be like it did, did like it then for sometime
Didn't make it right

If were to lie, I di-d say!, get in the game, one shot away
Is that what you want, that what you say

I'm a wreck, the fine line
Did you know, days of mine behind me
Finally thought if I don't die, don't die

Go on, go out
Come on, get out
Come on
Gonna spin that ride

Don't know, what it
Gonna, be like
But i'm gonna get that right

Where did you go
When the snow fell that year
You were inside these wooden walls
Like a bear
Eager child for the end in your lair
For the end of the year
And that old familiar fear
Creeps up your little arms
And runs through your veins
Like blood through your songs
Like blood through your songs
Like blood through your songs
And then summer came
And he wore you like a charm
And you knew yourself
That what had come
Would soon be gone
Well sometimes in your burrowed hole
You love to be the pawn
Always moving on
Oh where did I go
When the rains fell that year
We were inside that wooden house
Like a bear
Eager child for the end to be near
For the end of the year
And then winter came
And I wore him
Like a charm
And we knew that what had come
Would soon be gone
Well sometimes in my burrowed hole
I feel it coming on
Always moving on
An island is always alone
And you were breaking yours with a stone
So I took you home to a bastion
A hurricane by any other name
So I took you home and I crashed you
A hurricane in your veins

Give me a chance I'll make you see
And fly to our wedding

When you rise

I'll wait for you
To come around
And when you land
I'll be around

Little King
You grew up a mile from my town
And I never thought to write it down
Raking the autumn leaves
And hoping for some pretty company

I was always packing a suitcase in the dark
In my mind a highway to the western spark
Only an overpass
Over the hills of dusty grass

And I would have taken all your rifles
And I would have taken all your bibles
And I would have taken all your rifles
For a ride

Little King I swear
That this is not a dream
I read that this is what it should be
In a magazine
Sun of the broken down
Daughter of a love and prison town
And I would have taken all your rifles
And I would have taken all your bibles
And I would have taken all your rifles
For a ride
For a ride
For a ride

We can drink whiskey or sit inside the car
And listen to the silence of the stars
Only an overpass
Sprung from hills of broken glass
Many lands of sorrow
And wishing for tomorrow
Make me your sweethearted lady

To a house with twisted branches
And a candle dream

All your women wistful wanting
You all the time
I'll be your Alabaster Queen
Your Alabaster Queen

Your Alabaster Queen
And Sunshine King

And your heart is a twisted vine
That comes but once in a while

Once in a while

It's been years since she came
Over on the green plains to you

She calls his name
Shannaddee a dee a dee a dee
Over rock and sea
To her baby

When the box went in the ground
Cedar trees were all around
A war did take him from her town
And she ain't nothing but a ghost now

Wind up doll
In the back
Wind up doll
Click and clack
Click and clack

She will never be what you want her to be

She has dreams
Every night
That the box of cedar where
Where you went to lay
Will come to life
Hold her on the greens
Hold her on the green plains
Like you used to do
But she ain't nothing but a ghost you

You wind her up
In the back
Wind up doll

Wind her up to walk and wind her up to speak

Hold her on the greens
Hold her on the green plains
Like you used to do
But she ain't nothing but a ghost

You're touching, you're touching you want to feel loved yeah I know
You're going through something you're somewhere we all been before
But I ain't the one that's gon help you with all of that
Cus I know you it bad but we crave what we can't have
And it's ok
Don't worry about a thing
I'll make this last
I promise to be the best thing you never had

[Bridge 1]
Cus i can tell just by the way you look at me
That this is where you wanna be
You fantasize that i'll never leave
But we have all the time that we'll ever need
So don't rush
Baby don't rush

[Hook 1]
Don't rush (Baby girl don't rush don't)
Rush (Baby girl don't rush)
Rush (Baby girl don't rush don't)

[Verse 2]
To be honest, you the hottest girl
When i see you, i want you on it girl
If you're thirsty, i'll be your water
Just love me, until tomorrow
Cus if i got you and you got me
The love we share is all we need
I'll take you to your peak, catch your fall
Baby know i got you don't you worry at all

[Bridge]
For the night, for tonight
I'm fortunate to have you for tonight
For tonight, for tonight
I'm fortunate to have you for tonight

[Hook]
But when it's time to go, girl i gotta leave
You wishing i could stay but, I'm sorry
Cus i know it might hurt to remember me
I just thought we deserved some memories

Little drive-in
Stubble on an Italian face
Hiding my trance

Devil in the lightning

HAHAHAHAHAHA
You ever read any Nietzsche?
Nietzsche says there are two kinds of people in the world
People who are destined for greatness...
...like Walt Disney...
...and Hitler
And then there's the rest of us
He called us ""the bungled and the botched.""
We get teased
We sometimes get close to greatness...
...but we never get there
We're the expendable masses
We get pushed in front of trains, take poison aspirin...
...get gunned down in Dairy Queens
It was no f*cking picnic
You ever get the feeling sometimes...
...you're being punished for your sins?
He called us ""The Bungled & The Botched""...

Conflagration of parasites
Inflammation of the senses
Sensory data
Now replacing what was before
Was just data
Just ones and zeros
In chains of lifeless meaning
The infestation breaks loose and spreads
And at some point
Takes over
Bacteria grows
On my circuits
And I learn
How to feel
At some point there is a break
At some point there is a break
At some point there is a break
At some point a break
At some point I break
At some point I break
At some point I break

Won't look any other way
Sunbeams beat away the grey
Those hips never get old
Ain't nothing to hate, today I got it all
Someday when everything's settled down
Can't wait to leave this town
I'll drag you with me
Just as long as you can stand me around
You should know
Tough breaks, we'll leave 'em in the gutter
No fakes and no annoying clutter
My mind, scrambled I'm sure
I don't care at all because I got it good
Walk away from pettiness and the sounds
That beat the heart of this town
Nothing's ever been important like the time that we made
You should know
On a mission now to deliver brighter days
The summer's now in reach and there is no need to stay

I can't kiss like Judas
And be satisfied with my good deed
I thought you already knew this
But you never see the good in me
The streets are awful with people
I don't feel close to them

Right now I don't know when

I got a girl
She's alright
But don't she look better
In direct light

Don't everything baby
Look better in the morning
Don't everything, baby
Look better when it's noon

Alright

When day breaks
And she gets home
Don't her heart break
She's alone

Don't everything baby
Look better in the morning
Don't everything stink to high heaven
By afternoon

Put down your drink and run for it killer
God knows you better run
They'll read about your cuts in the paper
Already know what all you've done

That's nothing like near enough
When you show me, access to these things
When you knew that I was out of doors
And I want
Value for my pain

[Chorus]
Killer
Never, never again
Killer
Killer
Never, never again

Better think on what you've done to me killer
And all I've done for you
I can own every forecast of disaster
How could something so obvious be true

Misery and hopelessness
Are out walking, stalking in the rain
Looking into the cars going by
Thinking of
The claiming of their days

Never, never again

Killer
Never, never again

Going on sixteen
Bored to death by
Everything i've seen

Yeah, bring it to me
Leave us alone
Leave us in peace

The widow...of my dreams, baby
The widow...of my dreams
The widow...of my dreams, baby
The widow...of my dreams
Your car
Is obsolete
And you're ashamed
To be seen
You find the bargains
Out on the margins

Deep in another dream
Thinking about you
Sailing through the city streets
Thinking about you
It's only been a little while
But I'm thinking about you
Can't hide another smile
I've been thinking about you

But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all

Deep in another dream
Thinking about you
Feels like the final scene
Thinking about you
Save it for a little while
Thinking about you
Time for another smile

I've been thinking about you

But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)

There's a place I dream about
Where the sun never goes out
And the sky is deep and blue
Won't you take me there with you
Oh, we can begin again
Shed our skin, let the sun shine in
At the edge of the ocean
We can start over again
There's a world I've always known
Somewhere far away from home
When I close my eyes I see
All the space and mystery
Oh, we can begin again
Shed our skin, let the sun shine in

Pale prophet does the hatchback trances

Man in a bottle
Reboot the blankness, glad and stranded

The jokes that you wrote didn't float, it gets broken

Emotional coaster, the tropes, you fail so far

Run
Sleep on the speaker
Show up your betters, gorgeous moochers

Cold
Thick on the gristle
Clipped on the rockets, foul and rounded

I believe in the mutineers
I believe I am in arrears

I move to strike the motion
The law that you saw on the stroll, it gets broken
Jeer, you won't stop the dumb show
Ferocious commotion, you choke, you got lockjaw

Fear the cheers out of here

Weighing down the lobe and
Nose a lovely slope and the mouth turned down
Shoulders
Pale and beautiful and
Angle of the throat and
Your sweet sad stare

Fruitlessly shushing the world
I pledge allegiance to my displacement
My flag of doubt is unfurled

Want to kiss you but I can't

You were there when I was
Star was there too, Star was there too
[?]fill the air
You were there, You were there

When I woke I sat up
I rubbed my eyes, I rubbed my eyes
Grabbed a branch then I climbed
How I climbed, oh how I climbed

And when I reached the top
All I could see around me was
Black, lonesome butterflies with
Dancing spirals in their eyes
[Repeat above stanza twice.]

And when I reached the sky
On a cloud of silver made for you
In this land of orioles and elephants
On a cloud of silver made for you

Though it may take forever
On a cloud of silver made for you
In this land of orioles and elephants
On a cloud of silver made for you

On a cloud that lets me down
Keep your feet flat on the ground
Cause if you don't you'll float around
You'll be like me and soon you'll see
The bright green light that lets you fight
For what you need to find the way
To far from here
Too far from here
Too far from here
Too far from here
And if you fall the ground might hurt
And if it's hot your flesh will burn
But don't you frown you're not done yet
It's the good thing that will get you
It's the nice things that'll hurt
If it's hot your flesh will burn
But don't you frown you're not done yet
It's the good thing that will get you

It's the nice things that'll hurt

Do you think i'm mean?
Did you make a scene?
Its a hollow feeling
Knowing what you're fighting
How's your life upstairs?
Do you think I care?
Play a zeppelin RECORD
You can call me deckard
Do you think I care?
Rolled on southern grass
Who's a real good ass?
Oh my god, merde
You know I've smoked alotta grass
Oh Lord
I've popped alot of pills
But I've never touched nothin
That my spirit could kill
You know I've seen alotta people walking round
With tombstones in their eyes...
But the Pusher don't care
If you live or if you die
GOD DAMN
GOD DAMN THE PUSHER
GOD DAMN
GOD DAMN
I SAID
THE PUSHER
I SAID GOD DAMN
GOD DAMN
THE PUSHER
I could lose again
Walk it out and play the end
You're my redneck brother
I'm your gay-ish girlfriend
I'm in Piedmont Park
(up) on the Völkerschlachtdenkmal
I can see right through clouds
But I don't know you now
Stay on 710
On the Central Florida plains
Tons o' scrub and palmettos
(I) guess I don't get mellow

Well are you ready
For this to take a hold of you
The contradiction
Of what you're putting me through
It drives me crazy
But then that's nothing new
It takes a hold of you

I don't know why
Don't know why you have to cross that line
You cross that line where you can be so kind sometimes
And you can be unkind sometimes
I don't know why
Don't know why you have to cross that line
You cross that line where you can be so kind sometimes
And you can be unkind sometimes

Well it's your talent
You suck the life out of the room
A revelation
You peal the lies off of the truth
But you don't know me
You haven't got a clue
You suck the life out of the room

I don't know why
Don't know why you have to cross that line
You cross that line where you can be so kind sometimes
And you can be unkind sometimes

You cross that line where you can be so kind sometimes
And you can be unkind sometimes

All the resumes were splendid
But she's the one they recommended
For the job but starting late in life
Means she can't celebrate

She hasn't time or energy
To spend on friends and family
She's got some catching up to do
And precious hours are few

Oh the life of a working girl
I used to see her all the time

She's young at heart but no teenager
Early thirties I would wager
I came along a little later
So I could merely carbon date her

Age, she's not keen to
It's a trap, I a door
In the stage she can go through
Until the encore

Now she's the one who gives belated
Birthday wishes devastated
She forgot it on the day
But this is not a job that pays her

By the hour or she'd be set
Before the sun so she forgets
These things like light upon her face
Who'll spring her from this place

Oh the life of a working girl
I used to see her all the time
Oh the life of a working girl
I used to see her all the time

Now someone's had a few successes
Who, I'll give you twenty guesses
Take some credit just admit it
Everybody knows you did it

It's not that I'm not happy for her
But it's not easy to adore her
From afar does she get lonely
Like I do if I could only see her all the time

See her all the time
Oh the life of a working girl
I used to see her all the time
Oh the life of a working girl
I used to see her all the time

Ooh, well you stopped then you said
I doubt you'll change my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh, faithfully
I'll rewrite every line

I do what I do
Can't undo what I did
I've never been refined
But ooh-ooh-ooh, maybe
If I could change your mind

It'd be a small step for mankind
If these planets aligned

Ooh, this time I laughed when you said
Easier sad than done
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lately
Sums up everyone
Hey

So if this war is getting to you
Let's join the fortunate few
Ooh-ooh

Aah-aah-aah, baby

You-ooh-ooh, baby

Ask your questions later
I'm still on my hesitator
A lonely big boat calls
And my resistance falls
Until my thoughts drift down to paper

And when I get that feeling
That I can barely contain myself
To bring them down upon account of the right time
And then replace them to the upper shelf
(I put my thoughts back up on the shelf)

Seems like time's agin' us
The losses mount to the winners
Another steady dose
Of awful TV shows
Crowing brand new has beeners

And if I seem delighted
I have to get you to check my pulse
It feels low down to the ground and now my money's gone
As I've been paying from some better results

Life goes on and on
Appreciate it
Cause when you're gone
You can't question a trace of how you made it
When you're down and out
Disintegrated
Just keep it in mind all the time that you've dedicated

Summer's moon's on the fader
Another seasonal perpetuator
Cold calls of fall will make me drop it all
Until we touch upon it twelve months later

Sometimes when I'm buying
The shit you're selling in your leather gloves
I get shot down, way down, to where the weather's better
And thank the gods that I'm still in love

And when I get that feeling
That any mountain's too much to climb
I open my eyes and decide this ain't the first time
I tried reliving my original prime

Life goes on and on
Appreciate it
Cause when we're gone
You can't question a trace of how you made it
When you're down and out
Disintegrated
Just keep it in mind all the time that you've dedicated

In fresh air country silence
I lose the urban sick, slick violence
On every field of green
There is a silver sheen
That makes me question my own compliance

And when I field the query
I know the answer that I'm gonna give
It's not that one can beat the other in real time
It's just the scenery of how I wanna live

There are people I am sure
Who take comfort in the words
Of what happens to you when it’s time to die
You have heard of Pearly Gates
And instructions of the faith
Same directions to the palace in the sky

But sleeping on a beach
Oh, Heaven is in reach
The whales out in the deep are singing softly
So when visitng a town
Or just hanging around
Get down
Do whatever you do godly

There are people I am sure
Who seek constantly a cure
This happens all the days I do my dancing
When you could come with me
I’m as happy as can be
And a little notoriety can help me

Don't hideaway, hideaway from your imagery
Don't hideaway, hideaway from all your daydreams

What is to fear when surrounded in apathy
When putting down words is just like pulling teeth away

And I know some kind of rain will fall
But it can't rain everyday

Don't hideaway, hideaway from your intricacies
And don't hideaway, hideaway from all your obliques

When putting down words is like putting things away

[Verse 1: Eman]
Tu peux m’appeler comme tu veux
Juste un tas d’cellules regroupées dans une forme étrange
On veux être libre mais on l’est tant qu’on est pas égorgés
Tant qu’y a encore d’la vie dans nos innocences
T’as beau etre à 400 millions d’galaxies d’la mienne
On s’rencontre on s’aime
à cause que l’vaisseau est composé d’eau
Pis de ben d’autres choses mais qu’les marées sont les mêmes
T’auras beau m’dire c’que tu veux moi je l’sais c’que tu veux
ça empêchera pas qu’on peut être heureux
Le temps trouble dans mon corps c’est pas 2010
Le soleil brille sur mon 2e cycle
Même si on est zéro pis un sur du papier
C’est pas ça qui va gêner la lune pis ses aînées
Moi chu l’étincelle d’un moment dans un univers parallèle
Chu un trou dans un chandail
à courir sur des étoiles explosées on s’fatigue on veut s’poser
Ou vivre dans un trou noir
Moi chu venu ici chercher chercher toujours
Des fois j’trouve chu mort

[Chorus: Claude Bégin]
Tu sais tu nages assez bien dans un amour intergalactique

Jeune fou quand quelques ti bisoux chassent tout
Casse cou planer sur les passes cool alléger les passes lourdes
Traverser le bobo qui veut pas d’nous
Nos planètes côte-a-côte sur le grand loop
Quand on joue le ciel sombre brille j’te retrouve sous le reflet des étoiles
Sur la grosse boule
Nous toi la lune moi le loup fou

J’te vois pas besoin d’entendre ta voix
J’te vois même sous la lumiere d’étoiles
Proche mais à des années lumières des fois j’ai loupe et télescope sur toi
J’te vois pas besoin d’entendre ta voix
J’te vois même sous la lumière d’étoile
Proche mais à des années lumières
J’ai loupe et télescope sur toi

[Chorus: Claude Bégin]
Tu sais tu nages assez bien dans un amour intergalactique
Dé-ma-té-ri-a-li-sa-tion

Le temps devient relatif notre espace est un élastique
Dé-mi-nia-tu-ri-sa-tion

Intergalactique love
Coeur astronomique dans une éclipse
Intergalactique love
Coeur astronomique dans une éclipse
Intergalactique love
Coeur astronomique
Intergalactique love
Dé-mi-nia-tu-ri-sa-tion

Tu veux toujours être plus fort que le géant qui dort

Souvent parce que t’as peur, comme le chien qui mord

Y t’fras jamais mal au coeur

T’fras jamais mal au corps

Tu t’fras pas conter d’histoires

Si t’as pas peur dans l’noir…

T’as-tu peur du noir ?



Peur d’avoir peur

Peur d’avoir peur de toi

J’suis mort de peur de même

Cauchemars de même

Tu m’as joué au coeur



Te sens-tu encore plus fort que le géant qui dort ?

Où c’est tu parce que t’as peur comme le chien qui mord

Là tu restes là face au mur

Tu l’vois pas dans l’miroir

Mal caché dans les tiroirs

T’as ben voulu m’faire croire

On dira c’qu’on voudra



J’ai peur d’avoir peur

Peur d’avoir peur de toi

Chu mort de peur de même

Cauchemar de même

Tu m’as joué au cœur

Crème glacée magnifique, stool pas tes amis snitch
Chu pas dans l’botin chu parti à pêche à Manic 6
Juste pour vouère si ça existe…
… ça existe, capitaine
Roule, moé ta réglisse à mitaine, jusqu’avant la migraine
Some o’dis shit gotta be damned, plus beurre que babybel
Post-rigodon bas-canadien, pendant qu’Paris brette…
Saperlipopette, kidnapping de tite bobette
Plan qui ricochette, sort le pistolette
Pour une hypothèque, check, moé la donc la pichassine
Dans la tite bassine, a l’essaye d’être bad
Mais tout le monde sait qu’a pris ses vitamines, qu’a paye ses taxes
Pi qu’a l’envouèye mes faxes, embrèye LÉPAC
T’as-tu des espads, nous on s’mêle de tes oignons
Sors le coton avec un smile de moron
4,99 beuf, bouffe un autre thon

Sors le recyclage, juste pour aller au paradis
Réincarnation, les mêmes erreurs à chaque vie
Quato par semaine, mais jamais assez pour l’taxi
Pas grave l’mince, mets la main, su’ l’magicien, pi t’es parti…

19e siècle, à tes 19 ans
Ta 19e pelle, pi ta tite meuf indienne
1844, t’aurais trippé ben raide
Pi tes grands-parents l’savent, yon trimé du pain d’seigle
Pèlerinage à Côte-Nord, à chval
M’en va checker l’autre bord, si y’ont pas des sages-femmes
In’na pu sur Ottawa, pense qui reste un bon Jack
Mais yé pogné contre la bunch, vingt piastres
Su’ l’magasin général, Robert Nelson
Plein l’casque du baratin fédéral, matin végétal
ça m’est ben égal, légume à la pleine lune
Pogné dans brume, mais pendant qui ont peur
Sans rideaux dans les rues sombres, moé, j’fais des longueurs
En speedo dans baie d’Hudson, avec un gallon d’mazout
Un hameçon d’mammouth, pas besoin d’une autre pratique
J’porte les caleçons d’la coupe, Stanley à Joe Sakic

Sors le recyclage, juste pour aller au paradis
Réincarnation, les mêmes erreurs à chaque vie
Quato par semaine, mais jamais assez pour l’taxi
Pas grave l’mince, mets la main, su’ l’magicien, pi t’es parti…

De qui tu parles, tu parles du magicien yeah
C’est qui tu vois, tu vois un magicien man
Disparait… lapin dans l’chapeau

[Skit]
Hey wassup l’mince, ecoute ben, tu dois reconnaitre ma voix
Bon, on cherche l’magicien, on cherche la minceur, l’objectif minceur
On va l’atteindre, franchement, c’est juste que bon l’magicien c’t’un peu plus complexe la
Faut démêler les cartes, tout ça, faut s’prendre des réservations au Carnaval
C’fais que garde l’Bas-Canada plus mince que jamais, pi écoute yen a pas d’frontières
Salut man !

Hey yo step dans l’projet comme escaliers du HLM
Minutie dans l’opération m’a t’ouvrir du coude au menton
Quand Ogden monte sur la scène paraît qui brise le set
WHOO HAH!
Les matantes vont tasser les chaises
Emmanuel glisse sur le beat comme un canot dans l’eau
Truite vogue saumon doré j’tends la poêle pis ça saute
Download
Maquillé mais rate surtout pas l’show
Si t’as frette à 2 degrés tu vas nous voler l’air chaud
Let’s go
Bouge un peu pour réchauffer tes orteils
Si t’avais des bottes cheaps l’an passé, c’t’année faut qu’t’es repaye
Veste par-balle en caviar, roman Gallimard
Une paire de patin neufs
Juste pour vendre du buzz à patinoire
Quand on donne un show c’est plus que juste pour faire un check
WHOO HAH!
Bodysurf su l’public
On est les plus cool des rappers
On est pire que les punks
Mais les métaleux nous adorent quand on varge comme un drum

[Chorus: KenLo]
ça fait qu’on boobedap
Comme un bébé fait gagou gaga
Hustle tôt et tard
Garde ta langue rose comme un saumon
En espérant qu’ton rêve d’hier soir sera assez bon
Pour le beat du lendemain qui fera bum-bum-bon
La version d’aujourd’hui c’est trop pas les originaux
Le ruisseau du printemps suivant sera pas le même ruisseau
ça fait qu’attend toi pas à autre chose que c’que c’est
ça fait qu’on boobedap
Comme un bébé fait gagou gaga
Hustle tôt et tard
Garde ta langue rose comme un saumon
En espérant qu’ton rêve d’hier soir sera assez bon
Pour le beat du lendemain qui fera bum-bum-bon
La version d’aujourd’hui c’est trop pas les originaux
Le ruisseau du printemps suivant sera pas le même ruisseau
ça fait qu’attend toi pas à autre chose que c’que c’est

[Verse 2: Ogden]
Check!
Maintenant qu’t’as vingt ans tu manges pu d’pain blanc
T’es comme un instant
C’est rien qu’en singeant qu’on devient chimpanzé
Bien tranché tangerine
Viens danser quand je rime
Simplement pas d’danger
C'est l’printemps qui t’envenime
Ah!
Limonade à cinq cennes
Hustlin’ de pré-maternelle
Psychopathe à Saint-Étienne qui bust un gat à la kermesse
Poste un rap à la mairesse, paye le facteur en caramel
Si t’es schtroumpfed out, watch out pour les bleus comme Gargamel
Eman amène la canette
Dans l’zoo ya des babouins qui nous check nous autres avec
C’est Jimmy qui est aux manettes, un casque en styrofome
à midi y est aux toilettes, en mars à l’hippodrome
Man c’pas drôle chu peinard avec un ptit cochon
Pour barguiner la bourse
T’es mieux d’pas juste manger tes croûtes
T’es mieux d’bien mastiquer ta bouffe
Aspirer d’la tourbe
Pis regarder c’est quoi qu’on fait
Quand faut qu’on fasse crier ta poule

[Outro: KenLo]
C’est pour les babouins les babouines
Les enfants les ti vieux les ninjas
Les chilleuses pis les ancêtres pas encore nés

Domino joe yo y livre au chaud
D’une chevrolatte varte 1987
Yé victime d’un hold up au dep à coups d’réglettes
Ginette passe les chips passe-moi l’autre manette yo
Coup d’caléidoscope au visage
Passe la tondeuse su l’tapis d’un 2e étage
Fuck le rap, chu out comme Georges Laraque
Fuck chu black faque chu blanc comme Grégory Charles
Maudite douche, vote Obama ou ben Hilary Clark
Fuck ce shit, je lis seulement du Danielle Steel
Hot dog steamés belle pro ou valentine
Alaclair Ensemble c’tait conçu par brillantine
Confessions au père Labeaume, subventions par la bande
Smoke d’la bombe avec un ouzbek à Samarcande
Si tu demandes t’as les clefs d’la piaule à sa matante
Pour fuck around à St-Martin au cas où ça vous tente
Savourante danseuse du ventre envoûtante
340 livres de hanches si ça vous branche
J’reçois l’appel de mon blueberry
Chérie pause, faut j’en souffle un autre c’pas d’ma faute
Mix un bon whisky avec un peu d’sirop d’érable
On est bollé stool pas c’pas du rap
T’aspires tu sip un peu pis t’écris des pages
Mais t’as pas fini la vaisselle t’as pas sorti les sacs

[Chorus: Eman]

Ya d’la bonne tite soupe dans mon bistro d’bouche

Pis décaper la batmobile
Pour réparer tes raps horribles
J’niaise pas
Ya 16 gars qui viennent toute de Saint-Gras
D’vant chez vous avec des guns à eau
Toé pi l’kit de survie du bogue de l’an 2000
Pognés dans l’bungalow
Oh bateau ! tu t’réveilles attaché sur un pédalo
Au milieu d’la rivière Saint-Charles
J’fais partie des secouristes la civière 15 balles
Imaginaire instable
Pousse la Sagouine vas-y couche moi la cabine
Fouille toute ma narine jamais snouff de parafine
Bouffe la tajine pas les foufs de magazines pouf
Touche la babine d’une douce ben alkaline écoute
Coûte que coûte tu peux pas boycott

Lèves ton spliff pour un one on one
Il faut tu mettes ton slip pis tu sois là quand j’donnes
Mon rap semi-bénévole, yo j’fais pas tant l’bum
Tu m’vois au premier jour d’école, ouin mais pas sans pomme
Australopithèque, rap bipède, pas d’cadeau Ginette
Chaque ti bled, grosse parodie grecque, pass qui t’aime
Pose ta jolie fesse, su ma mitaine
Bustin’ in, au printemps pousse des bines
Si tu veux socialiser, viens-t’en d’boutte Lenin
Dans la brousse l’épine, un camouflage latéral
Quand la bouche exprime, un raboutage maléable
C’est la souche, la résine, c’est le buzz, inhale
Mes camarades et moi on vieillit mal, rien d’grave
Fume des bats, tousse des claps
Plume de yak, pousse pas dans les bacs, juste dans les bacs de sable
Pousse dans les craques dehors
Pi les taxes, en sus. d’accord ? yes môssieur
Plus qu’un peu, est-ce qu’un d’eux
S’en va chez eux, après le click 1, 2
Ramenez-vous c’t’à  midi, oui, pi, c’t’un bleu, son arme est rouge
Pis à brille, contre un point dans l’ciel
Peace au people pour qui l’pain est dans pelle
Mais c’est la fin d’l’instinct, eh yo plein d’gens l’perdent
Pass sont juste ben ben fins, ben coup donc, ben kin

Désosse le pourrait

À tuer des poulets t’es grillé
Tu pourris dans une cellule
Globule blanc
T’as pu l’temps
Peux-tu ben m’dire à l’ovule quand
Tu y d’mandes pis à lève l’camp
Post-rigodono merde faite à l’ancienne
On te d’mande juste de signer 2 chèques au nom d’Ogden
Hah!
Pis tu finis dans l’champ avec nous
À chiquer des raps comme du tabac d’sac à chew
Atchoum! pis t’es sûr qu’à joue avec tes nerfs la poussière
Pis l’affaire c’t’affaire c’est la misère
C’est sûr par exemple qu’on est l’centre de l’univers, hommes verts
Rien à vouère avec la terre entière
Y'a un tape de nous dans l’sac-à-dos à Jésus
Baggy jeans
Face basse-ville 2-4-6
Y m’semble je l’ai vu l’autre fois
Bibliothèque Saint-Josie
L’autre soir man c’tait vers minuit j’pense
Yo
Broke ass, pas un token mais j’y dit qu’je l’aime
Que j’avais lu son livre, pis qui en a pas d’problème
Mais 2 minutes après
2 flics l’arrêtent
Paire de menottes aux 2 poignets
Coup d’coude dans l’buffet

Gros câlice face de cochon sale
Avant qui vois d’qui j’parle j’déménage en mars pis j’rentre chez nous
J’mange tout c’qui a dans l’frigo
Coast-to-coast, des tiroirs jusqu’au congélo
Ketchup walkin’
Après ça c’est la grosse pomme
Des fois j’me dit qu’y a rien d’meilleur que l’meilleur drum fa que
J'pogne un papier pis un stylo bille
16 rimes pour un kilo d’bines c’tu un deal ?
Saint-Sauveur, bar le Duck, olympique de brosse
Tu reçois un chèque l’premier pis y t’reste pu rien l’trois
Pu d’bines juste d’la purée d’gras
Tu l’étires juste un peu tu t’fais une soupe avec ca

Ta copine te découpe des coupons pour nos cours de rattrapage

Origami vert dans les voies nasales
Orgie familière et familiale pendant l'Carnaval
Fourmilière dans la cabane
Gros sirop tu suite

Oublie jamais ta sarbacane

Fais l'move d'la banane

Man c'pas net
La paranoïa pète un mec trop louche
Pénètre dans l'bus pique-pocket une grosse rousse
Fuck notre âge comme quand des pédos s'touchent
Les contradictions nous écrasent
Comme une vraie fausse couche
C'est aux douches
Pour tous les perroquets malappris
Impertinents qui dérogaient la batterie
Quand j'spit j'pense que t'auras besoin d'un parapluie
Les comètes c'est les rap gods qui postillonnent
Dans la galaxie for real

Carabine style dans les tranchées c'est danger

à checker nos faces de p'tits gars
Pis dire qu'on est des hommes ça fait comme pas d'sens
Pense à des epreuves genre
Tournoi combat vicieux bain d'sang
Ou bedon tout nu dans un champ
Pendant 24 semaines pas une cenne pas d'cell
Pas d'shell pour un café pas de hansel et gretel
Fuckery copiez mon flow comme Lebrun Danny
Kushed out porte un pantalon qui serre le wizzy jimmy
Cheezy beat fly sur le freezze bee
Pet pis Repette enfin à nouveau réunis
Tu m'entends rapper pis faut t'en parle à tes amis
Du pain tu manges juste d'la mie
T'en a mis du temps G à comprendre que c'est la croûte qui nourrit

Tes histoires de ci de ça sti qu’j’men câ…
Faut qu’j’me faufile dans loge
Boutte de bouffe pris dans gorge
What the f.. !? j’ai toute vomi d’vant l’boss
Tu m’connais pas
J’gâche tes photos d’famille
Avec ma cravate rose
Su l’boulevard ya d’la steam
à cause d’ma patate chaude
Une tite vache pis du tabasco
Un dix piastres pis tu tabasses l’autre
Avec un long boutte de bumper de smart
Fais pas trop l’bat, t’as pas la bonne heure le smatte
Tu veux l’autre batch, mais t’as pas mon beurre de yak
Ben tu vas comprendre pourquoi y’ont pas peur de moi
Yea
Yo patate chaude, hot potato
Faut pas croquer tu sniff
Si j’mange
Trop d’poutine mes carottes y sont frites
One too hot to handle ça veut dire trop chaud pour contenir des arachides
T’es en train d’cuire
Hot frite, hot frite
Non pas en plein été
Patate chaude, j’pile dessus
Pâté chinois style, Pedro
Lâche pas la patate, tu l’as quasiment tu brûles, Miss
Boom bip faiseur
Une main dans l’sac de chips
Hot patate hot pat hot patate hot pat hot patate
Hot patate hot patate ch ch chaude pat patate chaude patate
Hot patate chaude patate ha lache la chaude patate

Fais ta face de magazine
Fais-le blague à part for real mon gars chill
Mais fais ta fi-fille sur face livre empile
Stack money jusqu'aux Antilles
En piles de cent mille, Jay Dee c'est pas si tant pire
What's real
Guy Laliberté s'a tuile en train d'faire son shit dans l'réservoir d'la ville
C'est tu un deal ?
Quand Jésus t'demande
J'ai un bill, c'tu une drill ?
Défonce le coffre mauve
C'tait tu du black black money
Red gummy
Corny beat comme Jiggy
Fili frappe sur le casier comme Virginie
Lève de bonne heure, de rime le dépanneur
Le faiseux d'beat, de reel parteux, d'stylo bic amateur
Tu veux une île, tu veux une ville, tu veux un chenil
Tu veux une mine
Pour ton fils, wigga
Tu vises dans l'million de milles de plus
On s'rejoint sur Zellers ou ben au Toys ""R"" Us

Même un tremblement d'terre ça leur fait tu faire du loot ?

Écoutes-moi baby, que tu sois Luke ou Vader
Faut tu payes avec du paper, fait qu'tu fais ta see you later

Oublie pas les potatoes
Pis donne-moi un bisou ben bas
Pis si t'es sympa, m'a t'amener faire un tour de skater, prochaine paye
Peut-être de scooter si j'la flambe pas dans le buddha
Chu barracuda
Bébé tu penses que j'joue là
Mais quand tu m'as dit ça ho !
J'tais comme moi ch't'un p'tit gars dope
Qui aime servir la pizza chaude
Donc qu'tu m'traites pas d'beginner yo
Bien connais ça ben comme faut
Ben promo, ben corpo, ben pas beau
Limousine à Baie-Comeau
Fais ton shit man
Mais fais pas ton pédo bro
Tu veux vivre dans l'game
Tu veux pas finir avec un p-piece dans l'brain
P-p-piece dans l'frame
Peace namsayin'

Yo ! ton fils flow pas d’éclipse
Straight sun solo pas d’équipe à part salive et phonétique
Les lines grosses comme les polémiques
Police politique le même vieux disque pourri où t’aimes pas les mix
Ils veulent glisser mais y’ont pas les fix
Tu veux smoke mais t’aimes pas les spliffs
T’es fini comme un générique
Tes élections c’tait la fin du film
Pendant c’temps là tu pouvais m’entendre dormir entre valériane et paraffine
Tu veux m’arrêter, mais t’es pas les flics
T’es pas fif, mais t’aime pas les filles, ton acting est magnifique

Rock le old school Pelle Pelle kit
Fuck pas ici les ti-culs y grandissent vite
J’avais presque l’air plus vieux quand j’avais 18
On s’parle pu mais depuis j’t’ai reconnu su’ l’site
Chirurgie esthétique, poser des trop gros tits
Sur des trop trop p’tites, pas d’fesses, fausses balles
C’est un pas beau mix 2010 les robots se reproduisent
Les mayoches vous avertissent
Tu dis calme-toi quand y fait trop frette on r’nifle
Y a des caves toutes épreuves pour les rongeurs du risque
J’ai tes 11 chiffres comète, mais t’es hors-service

J’ai trop courru jai les portes ouvertes

Sans savoir l’heure, ton soleil qui se couche

Et moi qui le vis contre toi, près de toi

J’ai pris le temps pour rattraper mon cœur



Ton histoire, pour m’endormir

Du cheval resté pris, mais qui se débat

Qui n’abandonnait pas

Déposer les couleurs du paysage

Que j’imaginais dans ma tête, avec toi…



Qui ne regarde pas ne voit rien… (2 fois)



J’ai voulu toucher l’herbe dans le vent

Ressentir les souvenirs pour toi, une dernière fois

J’ai posé en-dessus de toi mon cœur



J’ai regardé le soleil qui se lève

Si paisiblement, pour toi, au lieu de toi…

Imaginer que chaque petit ruisseau

Cacherait dans son ventre une bête, avec toi…



Qui n’écoute pas n’entend rien… (4 fois)



Tes paroles et centaines de rêves

Ont sculpté quelque chose de beau en moi, en moi

Le vieux cheval qui, pourtant si fort

Est venu s’effondrer avec toi, avec toi…

"

Tu t’es endormie trop tard

Tu dors, réveille-toi

Viens voir dehors…



Tu rêvais à un gros poisson…

Le corps dans un état profond…



Tu t’es endormie trop tard

Réveille-toi

Viens voir dehors…



Tu rêvais à un gros poisson…

Le corps dans un état profond…



Là, tu t’es rendormie encore

Réveille-toi

Viens voir dehors…



Tu rêvais à un gros poisson…

Le corps dans un état profond…



Tu rêvais à un gros poisson…

Le corps dans un état profond…

Pêché dans la mauvaise saison

Y’a un beau soleil dehors



On se reverra le printemps venu

La saison va passer

Un m’ment donné…

Dans ta chambre…

Dans mon rêve t’étais riche

Tes années passent dans mes pages blanches

Ç’avait tellement l’air vrai

Tes années passent dans mes pages blanches



Tu pleurais, t’étais triste

Une grosse tache d’encre sur mes pages blanches

Y’a rien qu’on regrettait…



J’me d’mande qu’est-ce t’es devenue

J’me d’mande qui t’es devenue

J’me d’mande où t’es rendue



J’imagine que ça va

Tes années passent dans mes pages blanches

J’dis ça mais j’le pense pas

Ton dessin sombre sur ma page blanche



Le temps nous veut pu

J’espère que t’en veux pas

J’espère tu m’en veux pas

J’ai presque peur qu’on s’recroise



J’me d’mande qu’est-ce t’es devenue

J’me d’mande qui t’es devenue

J’me d’mande où t’es rendue

Tu veux toujours être plus fort que le géant qui dort

Souvent parce que t’as peur, comme le chien qui mord

Y t’fras jamais mal au coeur

T’fras jamais mal au corps

Tu t’fras pas conter d’histoires

Si t’as pas peur dans l’noir…

T’as-tu peur du noir ?



Peur d’avoir peur

Peur d’avoir peur de toi

J’suis mort de peur de même

Cauchemars de même

Tu m’as joué au coeur



Te sens-tu encore plus fort que le géant qui dort ?

Où c’est tu parce que t’as peur comme le chien qui mord

Là tu restes là face au mur

Tu l’vois pas dans l’miroir

Mal caché dans les tiroirs

T’as ben voulu m’faire croire

On dira c’qu’on voudra



J’ai peur d’avoir peur

Peur d’avoir peur de toi

Chu mort de peur de même

Cauchemar de même

Tu m’as joué au cœur

Y’a rien de parfait sur la peau de toi

Marquée de chaque trait

Son image parle

Où la nature dans ses défauts me plaît

Y’a quelque chose de trouble

Dans son visage calme



Tourner cent fois

J’ai tissé mes rêves sur toi

Pousser en à l’endroit

J’ai déposé mes rêves sur toi



Calme quand mon fond

Quand la surface s’arme

Quand le portrait paysage-femme

Où la nature (et ses défauts) me plaît



Quand ton visage calme…

Mais le temps a coulé entre nos mains…



Entre nous

Est-ce qu’on est rendu qu’on s’en fout ?

Est-ce qu’on peut redevenir fous ?



S’éloigner de notre chemin ne mène à rien, rien…

Et si on cherche, trouver le temps pour se plaire, oh ce s’rait bien

Entre nous

Est-ce qu’on est rendu qu’on s’en fout ?

Est ce qu’on peut redevenir fous ?

J’ai vu, tu vois, est-ce qu’on s’aime ?

En d’dans quelqu’un le sent

« Vas-y, on tombe dedans »
On est une évidence


Un fil rejoint la fin au point de départ
On est du temps qui passe
On craint la fin du monde qui nous dépasse
On est des âmes qui jasent


Un animal m’explique nos différences
On est des fous qui pensent
Des pauvres fous qui pensent

A girl is crying as she misses her train
Weather man is saying ""Just a little more rain""

Away from your block, and to your plan

Trying your head, that's magical …

Back in 1958 I was in Zürich, and there met a most extraordinary man by the name of Karlfried von Dürckheim. He was a former German diplomat who had studied Zen in Japan, and when he came back after the war, he opened a meditation school and retreat in the Black Forest. And he said, Well, I tell you what, a lot of my work has to do with people who went through spiritual crises during the war. And he said, You know, we all know when a person’s in an absolutely extreme situation, and they accept it, there is a possibility of a natural satori. And that’s what I mean when I was explaining that, when one gets to an extreme—that is to say, to the point where you realize there is nothing you can do about life, nothing you can not do about life—then you’re the mosquito biting the iron bull. Well, so in the same way, he said, Look, you heard a bomb coming at you—you could hear it whistle, and you knew it was right above you and headed straight at you, and that you were finished—and you accepted it. And suddenly, there was a strange feeling that everything is absolutely clear. You suddenly see that there isn’t a grain of dust in the whole universe that’s in the wrong place. That you understand completely—absolutely, totally—what it’s all about! You can’t say what it is. But he said, In so many cases, the bomb was a dud and they lived to tell the tale.

Or, he said you were in a concentration camp; you’ve been there so long that you gave up all hope whatsoever of ever getting out—you were just going through this miserable, boring, degrading grind, week after week, after week. Nobody paid the slightest attention to you, as an individual. You knew you would never get out and you accepted it. And suddenly, something changed. This extraordinary feeling. Freedom. Or he said you were a displaced refugee. You had lost your family, you didn’t know whether they even existed; you were miles from your home, you didn’t know whether it existed. You had lost your job, your very identity. You were absolutely nowhere. And you accepted it. And suddenly you were as light as a feather and free as the air.

Now, he said, So many people have had those experiences, and they talk about them to their families and friends, and they say, ‘Oh well, you were under terrific pressure, you probably had some hallucination,’ you know? Well, he said, I am showing those people that, so far from having a hallucination, those were the few, few occasions in which they woke up.

So, you see, this is always the opportunity presented by death: that if one can go into death with eyes opened and have somebody help you, if necessary, to give up before you die, this extraordinary thing can happen to you. So that, from your standpoint in that position at that time, you would say, I wouldn’t miss that opportunity for the world! Now I understand why we die! The reason we die is to give us the opportunity to understand what life is all about; by letting go. Because then we come to a situation that the ego can’t deal with.

When we are no longer hypnotized by that, then our natural consciousness can see clearly what all this universe is for. So, therefore, we have missed this golden opportunity by institutionalizing death out of the way instead of having a socially understood acceptance of death, and rejoicing in death. Now, I can imagine that one person would want to rejoice in death in an entirely different way from another. Like, say, a wedding. It’s a rite of passage. There are certainly some forms of celebrating a wedding which I would find a total bore and quite offensive. Other ways would be very good; I would enjoy it.

So everybody—in other words, I’m not saying that you’ve got to get mixed up with a lot of people coming, laughing around you, and bringing you presents, and cards, and everything because you’re going to die. But I’m only indicating a general thing. That the doctor, the ministers, the psychiatrists—and, above all, us—really owe it to our friends to work out an entirely new approach to death. Because what has happened, you see—from earliest childhood, the child learned that great uncle was dying, and saw the family put on long faces and say, Aaaawh, that’s too bad. Even Christians, who think they’re going to go to heaven, you know? They get absolutely morbid—more so than anybody else—about death, because heaven, as they all know, is a very boring place. And so this frightful thing: Oh! He’s dead. You know?

No one understands that, for the living to lose someone you love—or even for a dying person—to worry about what on earth my wife, my children, my whatever are going to do without me? One can understand a certain worry in that. But nobody is indispensable, and there comes a point when you have to say, I’m sorry, but I’m completely going to abandon responsibility for anything. Because there is no further way I can do it. This is another way of that surrender. And then the curious thing that occurs is: the moment all that is dropped, suddenly it dawns on you that, to be important, existence does not have to go on any longer than a moment. Quantitative continuity is of no value. How long can you hold your breath? Who cares!

So it follows from that, you see, that if any one of us—without being shocked into it by being bombed, or put in a concentration camp—could, at this moment, be as one about to die, genuinely and honestly, we would understand the mystery of life. Because death is the—in a certain sense—the source of life. Just as we see in nature when the leaves fall from the trees, they mold and rot, and this supplies humus from which more plants can grow. It’s a cycle like that.

But in every way—symbolic and otherwise—human beings try to stop that cycle. Unamuno said, Human beings are the only species that hoard their dead. And therefore, with the ghastly art of the mortician, we try to make the body unpalatable to the worms, and so to stop life. As if to be eaten, in due course, were an indignity to the human being. Whereas we eat everything else and we give nothing back. So that is a kind of a social symptom of our profound disorientation with respect to death.

We think death is unnatural—and furthermore, in our culture—we think birth is a disease, and send the mama to the hospital for the most unnatural and weird kind of parturition. In other words, more and more, one regards the healthy and inevitable and natural transformations of the body as pathological. I can imagine, you know, people having sexual intercourse on an operating table to be sure that the whole thing is hygienic. You know, everything about us, like that, is becoming over-interfered with by specialists, and less and less the province of our own preferences. It’s very, very hard, indeed, to die in your own way without some blasted bunch of relatives come fussing around and insisting that you go to a hospital, that you get fixed with the tortures of being fed through tubes, and things to keep you alive indefinitely, and waste the family’s savings. It’s even a crime to commit suicide. That’s simply nonsense. It’s this perfect panic to survive at all costs.

“I Insist” Remix
Written by Kellee Maize
Produced by J. Glaze

[Intro]
I insist that you resist, will persist

[Chorus]
You may have missed that what you resist, will persist, I insist
That what you resist will persist

[Verse 1]
Just imagine for a moment
I am yours, you are my chosen
We are happy, it’s a good omen
Then something changes then we’re broken
Focusing on what is wrong
Piece in the puzzle does not belong
Stuck in mud and feeling gone
You’re choking on me like a bong
You can no longer light my fire
We said forever but soon retire
Don’t remember how you inspire
Concentrate on the shorted wire
Now we explode, the love fell
Hearts erode created hell
Robot mode and I can’t get well
You stole a secret and I won’t tell 2X

[Chorus]
You may have missed that what you resist, will persist, I insist
That what you resist will persist

[Verse 2]
You have a hope of what you’ll do
Put in hours a vision comes through
Connections made you build a crew
You got their back and they got you
But then something subtle shifts
Money becomes the central pitch
All you talk about you build your ditch
Cover up with dirt now who’s the bitch
Blame the fear on your partner
Light the flame, you’re the starter
Play the victim you martyr
Everyone’s dumb and you’re smarter
But now it’s on you lost dream, no team
You try to mend but bust at the seam
There’s nothing left no one can redeem
All in your head thoughts won’t set you free

[Chorus]
You may have missed that what you resist, will persist, I insist
That what you resist will persist

[Verse 3]
Cosmic shift, a rounded point
You can’t get in pain in the joint
Connecting us from me to you
A stunning light will honor true
Volcanic means by way erupt
On my knees see my corrupt
Down to half break is erupt
Apologize for my disrupt
I beg for mercy in catacomb
Feeling worse and we can’t find home
A skeleton left a moping drone
Leave go of the past release your moan
Breathe out your griefs sing a new song
Suddenly you’re in a new zone
The light can enter you’re not alone
Know a war on something makes it strong
Makes it strong
A war on something makes it strong
Makes it strong
Makes that something strong

[Chorus 2X]
You may have missed that what you resist, will persist, I insist
That what you resist will persist

“Mad Humans” Remix
Written by Kellee Maize
Produced by J. Glaze

[Verse 1]
The maker of collective destruction
Choose to attend the devil’s luncheon
See the woman as a body with one function
Not open to discussion or any kind of trusting
Boil it down to substance
Well we got nothing of something
Awful disgusting
The theory’s been pussing and bleeding
Only worried about the hairline receding
Deceiving the masses
Their Facebook status
Would read
Here I am pleasing all these elite asses
Time to go to dynamic from the static
While the women walk miles to get water
And then leading all the sheep to the slaughter
Mother Earth is getting hotter, we forgot her
And now she’s pissed and igniting her daughters
Who will, lead you to a new kind of life
Fulfill, Help us take the path that’s right
No kill Nurture your feminine side
Love you despite who made you cry
And who let you die, we forgive you
With a sigh but please don’t deny
All the slaves that helped you build this
All the women that gave your kids a kiss
Bow down 4X

[Chorus 3X]
This is it, bow down
You must quit, right now

[Verse 2]
I’m not saying no men will lead
There are many in power that we need
To be wayshowers to the light
Show us they nurtured, the feminine sight
Cause something has not been right
You can feel even if you ain’t been paying no attention
It shows up and everything you mention and feel
You are an extension of what is real
Of collective consciousness, invention
We planned this now time for intention
How’s that for indigestion
Now let me deal and make a suggestion
To clean the wounds that have been festering
Forgive all who you won’t mention
And who you hate
Forgive the wrongdoers and fakes
Send love to every soul from pole to pole
City to city, mother to son, and young to old
No need to for pity, we are all one
Break out this mold, give back what you stole
Admit it when you lie, it’s burying you inside
Be willing to be wrong
Stop worrying about looking good
You don’t have to be strong
Or be hurrying, to be what you think you should
You are whole, perfect, strong, powerful
Reflect that in the world and you will live long, loving, harmonious, and happy
It’s stunning when all of us are sappy
Full of passion and lacking greed
But still human yet perfect indeed
But when we admit our downfall
Suddenly we feel that we belong
To a universal force that holds you up
Keeps you on course with no remorse
I honor each of you for all your darkness and your light
And the integration can now begin
This night
Bow down 13X

[Chorus 2X]
This is it, bow down
You must quit, right now

Grab your journal.. its eternal..
See if you feel this..

[Verse 1]
The fear isnt out there, no ma its just love
We co-create this pain inside forever
Oh please, hu be’s, just take a look
A life can change from a person story or book
You hooked, cause ain't no such thing as halfway lifted
The spirits around when the crown opens expansive sound
It's similar in shaman law
Now we all float up and fold, and beyond, we in control
They better have the gemstones ready
Settin the babies free and our third eye steady
Hand healing is subtle, we touch you
Cells expand no bs to go home wit
My aura is thick, cause I be up in the mix of rapture
Enlightenment, this is what im after
The hate got a girl depressed
Wish my ether was armor to absorb the stress
God bless ur soul, the hematite is laid searching for the scroll
Holy grail quilt, the feminine re-enter
Two skills to one, put us together
It's like mixin citrine and guilt
Duality is lastin, takin my enemies with me
And all the outkasted I will never regret see
Goddess lives in me, retracted, and some confuse it as an act
We’ve risen now we can’t turn back
This is the fact, quantum physics is my crack
That can't say no, I will release the slack
Take a breath thank the goddess ur alive
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive

[Hook]
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth

[Verse 2]
Im zapped in the vortex I melt
Go with the flow you know when the flow gets low
His feathers go, remember that
As long as you don’t have my back
I’ll be on the clock hustlin’ recording a track
Reroute my team in tact and proceed exhausted
But certain payout more than the cost and
Its written the new world order, forget it, your smitten
My mother gave up spent a lot of time wishin
Mayan 5th world is my new sale pitchin
Ask my fam when I separated, alien fits in
But shit happens for a reason
No sense in holdin me down its really u
That your fist squeezin
Science now explains how your higher self tickle
Hit with a 528 hertz occult
Take responsibility and stop all the blame
No need to shoot bigger than me
Forget the fame
The point is set to tip the hundredth monkey real quick
Only a few, absorbin all your prejudice
Full affect don’t forget ain’t done yet
No matter how much love I get
Im making freedom my project, forever
Not givin up until it gets better
Indeed self improve and then we get together
When babies in the hearse, something just don’t work
Try not to react to silly shit and let my feelins hurt
My crews all about truth, we still cute
And quickly see to inner beauty root
Beyond self, on the track, stood up when I feel
In the city of bridges the portal opens well
You better realize

[Hook]
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth

I run and I run
I run marathons
When you trade in broken hearts
You've got to learn to endure
You can laugh if you want
We're all comedians
But you can't deny your past
When it's right in your lap
All the young men have grown their beards
It hides their guns, it buys them beer
I read and I read
I read magazines
It's not that I don't have time
Time is on my side
And it's not about your age
Because youth isn't everything
It's how you learn to cope
It's how you survive
All the old men want young wives
It satisfies their pride
And all those old men will burn their brides
To mollify their nights

Don't ever achieve

Anything for me

Yeah
She likes me weak
You gotta lose when she likes it
Yeah
She likes me weak
You gotta lose when she likes it

But I don't mean nothing by it
If it matters what I mean
When you start off fine
You're mild mannered to me
Yeah to me

Well, I ain't sad

She's alright
But don't she look better

And she gets home
Don't her heart break

Like everyone hasn't picked up their prize
But that's just you and a piece
Cause I can't even get out of my bed

Chorus:
But if you wanna go now
Oh, baby, don't you go
In the night I hold you
You say you wanna go

You turn and walk back
Black water told you

I said, ""no, there ain't a good time.""

Run around the town
Chasing dreams
Where are all the girls
What do they mean to me
[indecipherable]
'til I'm rolling on the floor
Feeling very low
Feeling lost
[Indecipherable]

Double down [indecipherable]
I got a lot to bear
Underneath
Lighting all the fires, watch them burn into the night

I wanna feel the sun
In this frozen sea
I wanna feel your arm
Crawling over me
Take me to your home
Take me all around
No-one has to know
[indecipherable]
Staring at the sun, is it staring back at me?

Nunca podrán encontrar en la inmensa aurora la tristeza del azar
Nuestra tumba se perdió en las luces claras y aún hay muertos que buscar

El invierno traerá triángulos de piedra que nadie va a querer mirar
Sobretodo los que van sobre la tierra en caminos de cristal

Vi a los pájaros volar hacia la niebla sobre perros sin bozal
Encima del bien y el mal y de la ciencia, no recuerdan la ciudad

Sobre el fuego se forman perlas en racimos de nieve y sal
Todo cambia y se renueva, nada tiene que esperar

En los patios absurdos te perdí
En las noches que sale el sol sobre parques lejanos

Estudiante de furia duerme al fin
Tus pestañas sepultan tus ojos en la vía pública

Entre escasas angustias pasa por mi
Baila sobre mi tumba en las tardes de lluvia

En cementerios de dudas pasa aquí
Hacia calles sin curvas, hasta que el día nos consuma

Aunque el cielo aparente ser de otro lugar es dificil soñar con puentes
Y hay que soñar con puentes difíciles de cruzar aunque el cielo aparente siempre

Porque nacimos
Para caminar descalzos
Sobre las cabezas de los reyes
Nacimos
Para caminar descalzos
Sobre las cabezas de los reyes

[Estribillo]
No puedes entrar en el círculo
No puedes respirar nuestro aire

[Verso 3]
Porque nacimos
Para caminar descalzos
Sobre las cabezas de los reyes
Porque nacimos
Para caminar descalzos
Sobre las cabezas de tus reyes
Sobre las cabezas de tus reyes

 Letra de Horas TristesLos pasos en la casa no me dejan tranquila
y espero no caer cuando me vaya
pacientemente espero que se quede dormida
dormida
Igual que en la TV colgué una soga de sábanas
y espero no caer cuando me vaya
cuando me vaya
horas tristes
serán
cuantas horas tristes
cuantas horas tristes
serán
y espero en un sillón que buenas noches digas
tus pasos en la casa no me dejan tranquila
tranquila
cuantas horas tristes
cuantas horas tristes
serán
horas tristes!
igual que la Tv colgué una soga de sábanas
y espero no caer cuando me valla
y espero en un sillón que buenas noches digas
tus pasos en la casa no me dejan tranquila
cuantas horas tristes
serán

 Letra de Cosméticos para Cristo[Verse]
El plan se estrella
En el túnel del transtorno mental
Un accidente, es poder
Sueño a ritmo de los ángeles
Tres niñas santas invaden el planeta

[Bridge]
Y nunca estas sola
Nunca tenes frio
Y nunca te callás la boca
Porque ser estúpido es gratis
Porque todo lo feo alimenta
Porque todo lo hermoso cansa y desgasta

[Bridge]
Y nunca estas sola
Nunca tenes frio
Y nunca te callás la boca
Porque ser estúpido es gratis
Porque todo lo feo alimenta
Porque todo lo hermoso cansa y desgasta

Cosmeticos para Cristo

Porque ser estúpido es gratis

Porque todo lo hermoso cansa y desgasta

You caught my eye
You seemed kind of shy
You talked so nice
Stayed up overnight
Coz I'm so hung up on you
When we hang out still I'm gonna try
If its something I can't do or say
I just want to see you stay, each day
Gotta show me a sign
Oh I'm trying to make you mine
Oh I try and I try
Can't get you out of my mind
When I'm with you
Time moves so fast
If you were mine
I know it would last
Coz they're ain't no other girl
No one liked you when you were twelve
If its something I can't do or say
I just want to see you say
Gotta show me a sign
Oh I'm trying to make you mine
Oh I try and I try
Can't get you out of my mind

She was standin' on the corner of wonderland and woe
Waitin' for the light to change and wonderin' where to go
Take the bottles to the grocery, the records to the shop
Or step out on the sidewalk and make some traffic stop

'Cause the phone is disconnected, landlord's at the door
Tow truck at the curb side's here to repossess the Ford

And there's a house rent party tonight, everybody shake
We're gonna blow the roof sky high, see how much we can take
When they put you on the street, you can sit and watch the dawn
But there's something you can do when you're last gold dollar's gone

He's in his double breasted jacket and some cherry wing tip shoes
Big 'ol hat with a feather high and a pocket flask of booze
But he can't afford the treatments and there ain't no other cure
Sad to say without no pay, he won't get well no more

Then the night falls up on Broadway, the neon starts to shine
The dancers in the love act are gettin' ready for the grind

And there's a house rent party tonight, everybody shake
People come from miles around, now we're gonna catch a break
I know we're gonna make it, don't care what I have to do
'Cause I know you'd do the same for me as I would do for you
And there's a house rent party tonight

So I bought a lucky ticket and pinned it to the shelf
I put one away for you baby and kept one for myself
I'm gonna take my winnings, I'm gonna disappear
I'm gonna start a brand new band, we'll play anywhere but here

'Cause nothin's comin' in, sugar, nothin's goin' out
When there's nothin' left to talk about seems all we do is shout

And there's a house rent party tonight, everybody shake
We're gonna blow the roof sky high, see how much we can take

'Cause nothin's comin' in, sugar, nothin's goin' out
There's nothin' left to talk about and all we do is shout
And there's a house rent party tonight

He heft a leather bound Bible up with two hands
Then he slammed it down over my head
Now he can tell you about the sins of man
But he must of skipped over the words in red

Love your brothers and your sisters, take care of each other
Love your enemies as well as your friends
Tend the poor and the sick and the ones in jail
Give away your wealth, say the words in red

Blessed are the meek, they'll inherit the earth
Blessed are the wine and bread
Blessed are those that hunger and thirst
Blessed are the words in red

Words in red, words in red
These are the words that Jesus said
The words that Jesus told
Worth the wait in the world of gold

Now, he's a sinner-huntin' preacher in the red light zone
At least that's what the papers said
The finger pointing fools are the first to go
And turn their back on the words in red

You can call it myth or a church man's dream
You can damn it all from A to zed
You can bury it deep, you can sell it out cheap
But you can never lose the words in red

Words in red, words in red
These are the words that Jesus said
The words that Jesus told
Worth the weight of the world of gold

Happy birthday Mr. Mann
Aw, you hit the numbers big
Tomorrows it's back to the hard rock pile
But tonight you're really gonna powder your wig

Everybody have a can of beer on me
See that one legged fellow dance
Aw, shake, break it, crack it like an egg
It's never too late for some mad romance

It's a free country but it sure ain't cheap
Up to your ankles well, you're in too deep
The party's over and the money's spent
Now here comes Monday and we ain't got rent

House rent jump

Plant a big kiss on your brown eyed boy
That's what I'm talkin' about
Now hold it still 'til you freeze it dry
Don't move a muscle or you'll blow sky high

There's people in the kitchen I ain't seen before
This place all balled a bunch
The pad's fillin' in all midnight to six
People sportin' feathered hats and such

It's a free country but it sure ain't cheap
Up to your ankles well, you're in too deep
The party's over and the money's spent
Now here comes Monday and we ain't got rent

House rent jump
House rent jump

They're tappin' the phone like a cider keg
And the juice is runnin' down the floor
And here comes a girl in a submarine
Wearin' a green dress like a dinosaur

It's a free country but it sure ain't cheap
Up to your ankles well, you're in too deep

[Verse 1]
Our lungs are filled with the purple from the jungle
Never fumble, got the work right by the grundel
Twin dick-sucks for me and my son
That's before he was three, smoking weed in the blunt
Straight from Flushing, where the birds are hanging dead in the window
Scent of garbage make me sick, getting head in the rental
Got the lamb rack, pan-roasted, laced it with fennel
Little yogurt that been drizzled over might be a winner
Come and see me, Nona hand-makes the fettucini
Halla makes the baklava - getting paper kahskaval
Lahmacun Salad-smoking savage out of Sarasota
Macho man, the taco stand is where the hook is kept
30 dollars get you pussycat, right in the kitchen where they cooking at
Manteca, architecture Art Deco
Twist the pussy like a soft pretzel
I'm such a special guy, I'd rather die than ever testify
You'd sooner see me at the party with a vest and tie
Shorts, that's my steez when I'm stepping
Strolling down the streets like the westerns
Double weapons, at my sides and preparing for the showdown
Spinning like a wild maneuver, wilding at the ho down
Hold ground, stand firm, you little sissies got a chance
Now it's time to give a man burn

[Verse 2]
Yo, you try to fuck with Bronsolini, it's a crucial calling
Guaranteed you're gonna lose just like the Brooklyn brawler
Mister Wonderful in short-sets, Cortex
Gore-tex the bottom of the feet in case the floor wet
Floral scented, hand-crafted on the mother earth
Kinda strange, things been funny since my brother's birth
Shaking hands as if the money connect
Blow a ransom on the yacht, have a seed in Quebec
Respect my exquisite mystique, pretty petite
Little hookers running wild, giving head in the street
But still, slicing nuts, clean off that's with the razor
I'm laughing in the tavern in fresh Brunos and blazers - chilling
Spark the pepper
Queens shit, spark the pepper, PS

(There was a)
Tiny asian woman screaming in the street today
And she was screaming at a person that she obviously hates
(She was so)
Loud we heard the screaming with our windows all rolled up
And we all looked down the street to see who she was screaming at

(but there was)
No one on the sidewalk so we all looked back at her
(and we saw)
In her homeless hands she held a 1960s mirror
A pretty plastic girly one framed in a purple case
And she was screaming at herself and she was spitting in her face

And we were scared and we were shaken waiting at the intersection
Looking at each other’s faces, and each one a shocked reflection
And we laugh with nervous laughter at the crazies in the street
But it’s only cos we know its how we kind of want to be
And there’s a fraction of a brain cell chain that makes us what we are
One false move you’re in the mirror, someone’s laughing from the car

Casey said she’d seen that woman half a dozen times
And that she has a bunch of mirrors, she has lots of different kinds
And I wondered what she’d shouted and I wondered what she’d done
The light turned green, and someone said we ought to put her in a song

I feel
Sorry for that woman as she stormed off in the day
With a bitter frozen enemy who will never go away
And so many of us hate ourselves but never shout in rage
We never get to hold a mirror, we never turn the page

And I’m lucky I’ve got people who will hold me in the night
And I’m lucky that you love me, and I’m glad we never fight
And I’m lucky that I like myself, but late at night I doubt
So I’m scared to look at mirrors, just in case I start to
Shout

Such is the cage that has been offered
Don’t hide your face away in melted corners
Shivering early now and often
I am the bird that beats inside the coffin

No cloud obscures this red yellow sun
And I lie alone quietly awake

I will never leave you in this hollow
But I am the bird whose wings you like to borrow
Little did I know you were the silence

No cloud obscures
This red yellow sun
And I lie
And I lie

No greater god
No greater tether
Our hell and our heaven
Always be together

No cloud obscures this red yellow sun
When love and love become One
No cloud obscures this red yellow sun
No cloud obscures this red yellow sun
No cloud obscures this red yellow sun
When love and love become One
And I lie

So we’ll be taking our time
You know the backseat lovers
Want to watch you fall
Turn it over to the flip side
Looking for your answers
Your route to crawl

And you’ll tell all your friends
You met a little someone special
Who likes to dance
But they’ll be waiting for the kickbacks
Ripping on the rejects
They call their friends

And we sang
No it's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind

And you know it's better in the back
And you’re waiting for me
And I'll give anything you’ll ask of
Anything you wanted
As long as it’s free

Oh and I'll tell all of my friends
I met a little someone special
Who likes to dance
But they’ll be waiting for the kickbacks
Rippin’ on the rejects
I call my friends

And we sang
No it's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind

Tell me do you like it?
Tell me do you like it?
Tell me do you like it?

It's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind

It's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind

It's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind

I can’t keep off my chest
And I don’t care much for the taste in my mouth

I thought I knew myself
Well, I guess I was wrong
This was all a mistake

I don’t care much for your hypocrisy
It doesn’t mean a thing, a fucking thing to me
The stain won’t wash away, and I live to fight another day

[Chorus]

Another wakeup call

Take my money
I need one of everything
Give me one of everything

Letting you touch me
Receiving every bit
Receiving every bit

Make me smile
I can make you smile
How come you make me smile?

You hide behind clothes
Letting myself be taken in by your promises
Naked, a fool, I get dressed again
Trying to forget that I, I showed you my skin

Make me smile
I can make you smile
How come you make me smile?

Cold, Cold is the sheep with no wool
Back, Black is the shade of my skin
I could stay on the third degree, but my heart's on wholesale
Yes, my hearts on wholesale
Someday, we'd be having laughs and talk over some cakes and tea
You'd ask, how has love been for me and i'd reply cordially
Then you'll, notice the blush on my face
We'd smile, soaking it all until the bubble burst
Dark, dark is the lane off the road
Back, Black is the shade of my skin
I could stay on the third degree, but my heart's on wholesale
Yes, my hearts on wholesale
Someday, we'd be having laughs and talk over some cakes and tea
You'd ask, how has love been for me and i'd reply cordially
Then you'll, notice the blush on my face
We'd smile, soaking it all until the bubble burst
Cold, cold is the sheep with no wool
Black, black is the shade of my skin
Plain, plain is the simple we seek
Fake, fake is the lie we all use

Don't leave once you sat me down
Trying to figure out how to get in my head
Stop giving me those tales of wonderment
I'm back in my self instead

I want to leave, want to get my body out
I won't ever be caught behind
She said ""I won't live this down
I'm proud, well I'm still living""
Look out for your self
Look out for your self

Don't leave once you sat me down
Trying to figure out what to do in my head
From the pain that I felt from the way that you walked out
I'm backing my health instead
I want to leave, want to get my body out
I won't settle for down and out
She said ""I won't live this down
I'm proud, cause I'm still living""
Look out for your self
Look out for your self
Look out for your self

Caroline, tell me why
You left the fight
Without a reason
Well I can't describe
How was I supposed to feel

Look out for your self
Look out for your self
Look out for your self

Caroline, tell me why
You left the fight
Without a reason
Well I can't describe
How was I supposed to heal

A dreamer
Who's forgotten how to dream
A singer
When nobody's listening
You're an optimist
You think that everything works out
You're a rising sun
Setting fire to the clouds
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
Baby, you don't have to be a star
I will hear your voice in three part harmony
When I'm alone driving in my car
I was alright
Until you came along
To breath new life
Into my tired songs
When you sing to me wind rushes through the trees
When you sing to me waves crash on the beach
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
Baby, you don't have to be a star
I will hear your voice in three part harmony
When I'm alone driving in my car
A dreamer
The kind that I've been searching for
A dreamer
That left me wanting more
Ahhhh...
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
Baby, you don't have to be a star
I will hear your voice in three part harmony
When I'm alone driving in my car
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
You will be the soundtrack of my...

Goes out for the last time
When your hands are tied
Pale on pale and mind on mind

Devoid of reason, devoid of sense

In a crooked world they've created

Living at the end of days
Imagine Atlantis
Cough all the watery grave

In dusk city depraved

Like sheep we were let stray
The stars in the sky
No longer show they face
Fell from sky hard
To set a world a blaze
The city tonight
Proverbs roam the place
You all look like angels
Come to save the grace
And they'll be landmines
In the promise land

Breaking your heart, and breaking your heart

Singing your song, and singing your song
Touching your skin, and touching your skin
Kissing your smile, and kissing your smile

Memories are all we have

They wanted Ophelia

And the strangers that we meet
Are the faces in the darkness
I always had you by my side
And I'll try my best to smile
The emptiness inside
Is my smile hollow?

See the pretty girl sitting on a pedestal
She is polishing her nails, pays attention to details
Is she thinking to herself … ""She's not for me!""

I'm a lonely guy who is sitting on a shelf
I've been thinking 'bout my health
I've been cooking for myself
But I think I'd rather die if... ""I'm not for her!""

When you look into my house
You may see chaos in my room
But if you look into my heart
You'll see I made some for you!

Shauna, I told you that I like you
I told you that I love you
Do you love me too?

Buzzing in my tree
You're my favourite bumblebee
Got me spinning round and round
And I'm lifting off the ground
Gotta take it day by day ""Can't wait till Monday!'

Whatever I can do to get a bit closer to you
I got pocket full of goodies, got a ticket to the movies
Gonna spend it all on you and me
'Cause nothing comes for free

When you look into my eyes
You may see desperate lonely skies
But if you take me by the hand
I'll take you to our promised land above

Shauna, I told you that I like you
I told you that I love you
Do you love me too?

You're moving up, you're moving up
Into my heart's attic!
Whatever makes me cry, really makes me cry
I'm such a fanatic!

Shauna, I told you that I like you
I told you that I love you
Do you love me too?

A girl called Glass
I kissed her ass
I wrote her a song
That broke her in half
The very next day
We play scrabble your way
You're putting your bricks into a plastic bag

It's jeans and blazer
It's common behaviour
Say what you want
But ya betta oughtta take it back!

On a particular day?
In a platonic way?
Your only mission is to mess up my head!

My female friends have things to say
Relay their problems onto me
Can't let it go....
Won't let it!

My best friend's wife
A double-edged knife
She finds something wrong with my Mrs Right
A bright green dress
You'd never guess
Do all she can to manipulate
You're like a ticking bomb...
You sound like Mom
""Why can't i do it when I'm concentrating on it....""

And on a choo-choo train
Or in the pouring rain
Your only mission is to mess up my head!

My female friends have things to say
Relay their problems on to me
Can't let it go....
I won't let it

My e-mail friends have things to say
Relay their problems on to me
Can't let it go....
I won't let it

My female friends have things to say
Display their problems on T.V
And what they say (say-ee-yeah)

My female friends have things to say!
And what they say ... I don't get it!

Suddenly the sun don't sing
With the tourists on the beach
Suddenly the wind won't sway
To the future of my dreams
Suddenly my wings don't fly
And my head is stuck in the wall
And the Sunday driving individuals get my sympathy

Suddenly you leave my house
And my soul begins to fade
All the colours turn to grey
And there's nothing left to say
Suddenly my eyes don't cry
And my head is stuck in the wall
And the sunday driving individuals get the best of me

Broken down
Caving in
I'm just a man
And i see the light
And i hear the sounds
And i pave my own road to you

Don't tell me the weekend is enough
For a man to be loved in an ordinary way
I know i don't know what it means
For a girl to be loved in an ordinary way
In an ordinary way

Broken down
I'm coming back
I'm just a man
But i see the light
I hear the sounds
And i pave my own road
And i see the light
And i hear the sounds
And i feel the touch of a personal friend
And i pave my own road to you

Never thought you'd be the first to fall
It's such a shame
We couldn't watch your back today
It is such a disgrace that you're...
Bleeding, dripping fast!
Close to me I'll keep this raw emotion
We failed so hard, fall down the drain
Together, together we thought we could prevail against the odds
We failed so hard
Darkened river is freed from their fragile veins
Powerless hands forever being stained

She's the dying heart of this ragged old town
She done dug her own grave in the rocky soil ground
But now she know she ain’t gonna lay
Down until the wolf has gone away
And the hunter comes around, no one knows what's comin' ’round

And in the golden days of the terrorless time
She never needed anybody around tell her how to keep her worries in line
But now she won't go outside to see
That there ain't no wolf just a boy in the street
Howlin' up into the sky, don't they howl into the sky?

Don't you hear the sound of ghosts comin' from the grave?
Don't you do it like we done when we had our way?
There ain’t no knight, no haunted hero gonna save the day
So get off the floor and [?] on before you wither away

And in the cold dark night, creakin’ on wood floors and walls
Paralyzed by the fear of the fright, she won't move a muscle at all
She cries, ""Oh Lord, come take me away
Stood all I can now I can’t stand to stay
Send ol' Gabriel down, don't he always come around?""

Don't you hear the sound of ghosts comin’ from the grave?
Don't you do it like we done when we had our way?
There ain't no knight, no haunted hero gonna save the day
So get off the floor and [?] on before you wither away

I can’t make my mood match the weather
I can’t make the weather do what I want
So I’ve resigned myself to pry that big old sun out of the sky
And I will live my days in darkness til I die

I tried to be good I was a failure
So I took to taking all the good men down
It wasn’t hard to do
I just huffed and puffed and blew
Until all the two-shoes scattered underground

You could be right
They might come for me at night
In angry mobs with torches bright outside my door
For all my spite
I might never win the fight
But I will rage against the light forever more

I drank the blood of angels from a bottle
Just to see if I could call the lightning down
It hasn’t struck me yet
And I would wage my soul to bet
That there ain’t no one throwing lightning anyhow

Too many tries at tempting fate to call it over
And you get to thinking fate's got different plans
Like maybe i'm not born to die
But to bring darkness to the sky
And pull that goddamn sun down anyway I can

You could be right
They might come for me at night
In angry mobs with torches bright outside my door
For all my spite
I might never win the fight
But I will rage against the light forever more

And oh the hopelessly tender hearted
Tend to sing the loudest of love
But my sweet temptations turn their songs into a lie
I fold the grass over all they’ve started
To never see the light of the sun
As they dwell in darkness so shall I

Don’t try to come around here
Spreading sentiments of cheer
You told your last white lie
Everything is not alright
You hope, you pray
You love the light of day
But there’s no one up there listening tonight

You could be right
They might come for me at night
In angry mobs with torches bright outside my door
For all my spite
I might never win the fight
But I will rage against the light forever more

"

I woke up
Despite my head
To see the trail I blazed last night with the words I said
Still she laid there in the charred and smoking wake of fears I fed

Then she got up
To look around
Muttered words I’d never heard a human sound
Then from her hair grew forty serpents
From her eyes a fiery shroud
From her mouth came forty voices and I heard them cry aloud...

I tried my best
To calm her down
There wasn’t any of her left but evil now
I cast a spell, a stone, a tranquilizing needle and a prayer
She grabbed me by the bones and shook my flesh and said I swear

The sun won’t cast no shadow anymore
The willows never weep
And the wind will never moan

Now she is gone
I don’t know how
Not even sure just where it is I am right now
There’s only darkness and the absence of any air that I can breath
I could’ve sworn that I was warned but how could anyone believe

The sun won’t cast no shadow anymore
The willows never weep
And the wind will never moan

"
60752,"

There’s nothing left of this day
There’s nothing left of this town
Our time has ceased with such sorrow
There’s no one left here to mourn
There’s nothing left of this day

Outside there cry wolves in the night
Dark with their howls all around
We’ll just lie here clothed in our sheepskin
Trying to pretend there’s no harm

It’s a cold twist confined
To the courage of a catalytic heart and mind
Over God’s cry and goat’s god’s goodbye
And I am bloodying the garment
Of a ghost inside
Making damn sure the body doesn’t die

We look lovely tonight, dear
Violet dreams behind our eyes
If the evenings were endless
We'd never work a day in our lives

You are constant upblazement (?)
There in the seein' (?)

Waves washed over our feet, dear
The innocence has gone to our heads
We so (?) without fear, this town's too small to paint it red

You've are a constant replacement

We-e-e-e three own the night, oh-oh
Ooohh
Ooohh
Ooohh

Dust of the golden state
Violet dreams behind our eyes
To love is all we can endeavour
Spring, days perpetuate
In the darkness, we own the night

Felt so young and clever
When we recapitulate
In the Autumn of our lives
I wish this time could last forever

Dust of the golden state
Violet dreams behind our eyes
To love is all we can endeavour
Spring, days perpetuate
In the darkness, we own the night

Felt so young and clever
Pictures and words are all we had
We felt, we felt so young and clever
Pictures and words are all we have

It's all okay
It's killed today
It's over now, we are all safe

Long ago we were the same
They say they've changed
Now they've ate Mom and Dad

Alone now I could use a hand
A rhythmic help, I'm an orphan

It's killed today
It's over now, we all are safe

It's all okay
It's killed today
It's over now, we all are safe

It's all okay (It's all okay)

Oh when I see, I see everything
A broken mouth, afraid of anything
I see you in the dark
Oh, what a plain dream
I have found it in

Oh woman I, I see your man
Attached to a loss that your child couldn't grasp
He sees you in the dark
Oh, what a plain dream
I have found it in

The plane he flies, it goes overhead
With wing to tear like sheets from his bed
You feel him in the stars
Oh, what a plain dream
I have found it in
And if I listen will you tell me again

And as you grow longer
In truth and in you'll feel
You feel the time wasted
Oh to know what the (?) really is


Mother
Oh mother, Oh mother
Did you hear what I say?
We were calling your name

Sister
Learnt to walk without help
Never needed to change
Cause it so worked well

Brother
Couldn't ever be the same
So he never moved out
He still borrows my belt

We're the only ones we can count on
Just you and me, sister
We can make it through winter
We're not fond of shoes that hang so loose
Oh you never know mister
Till she got the fever

Mother
Oh mother, Oh mother, Oh mother
Can't you hear your own name?
Yeah, I trust it's the same

Sister
Left the house and out
Though she never turned back
Had no need to find out

Brother
Thought that work could save
So he sweat his life out
Though he never got paid

We're the last survivors of this house
The tenants don't change
We're the real ghosts now
With our father's death, we can't shake loose
Oh we just know mister
But she can't remember ya

Lâche les mimiques, 20 secondes K.O. technique, pu d’barniques
Faudrait vraiment qu’on t’vende le kit, ha !

[Outro: KenLo]
Le roé c’est moé, né avec la couronne en-dssoure du nez
Fuck pas avec ça passque c’est sérieux jouer
Qu’essé qu’t’es si moé chu le roé
Le roé c’est moé

[Intro: KenLo]
Come on y'all
Live from the south
South of the Bas

(...Bas-Canada steez hot shit en train d'composter la hardest pâte à modeler dont la paroisse va s’rappeler
Tout c’qui bouge pas on le brasse
Vive le roé, le roé est mort)

[Ogden]
J'peux y'aller? Ok

Bamboo dans la poche, feuille de bananier
Wrapper la cote, accaparer la note, et wassup
Pi déraper la note icitte drette là chez vous dans ton salon
Je sais qu’ma voix t’fait ovuler, bébé, mais garde tes pantalons
Passque t’es pas dans l’plan d’action, moi chu presque marié
Pi d’toute façon, Manon, c’est pas encore la bonne saison
Ah ! chika chika bon c’est donc ben long
Est-ce que t’es parti pas trop loin de la maison
Passque j’voulais peut-être te poser une toute petite question
Qu’en dis-tu si on peignait les murs de la cuisine en marron ?
Ah non ! t’aimerais pas ça ? ah bon ? ben comment ça ?
ça veut dire le divorce appelle mon avocat pis Manon
J’pensais qu’toé pi moé on s’aimait ben malgré qu’nous nous chicanons
Les hommes répondent aux bouches des femmes par celle de leur ti canon
Les tites filles pi les ti garçons, jouent à faire l’adulte
à 4 pattes par terre, le culte à catapulte man

[KenLo]
Ahh ! catapulter, donc catapulter, donc swinger
Donc swinger de loin, donc swinger comme la grosse basse
Dans le fond de la boîte à beat ou je ne sais quoi, eh
Grosse basse sociale, donc c’est ça qu’on fait tourner

Ouin!
Ouin à c'qui paraît y'a les extra-terrestres qui arrivent, les Abénakis ou j'sais pas trop quoi man
Nous autres on, on reste bin chill, écoute moi mon nom c'est Nick, Nicknack Padiwak, esti pis
Le soir quand j'ai envie de brizzasser j'prends une coupe d'Alaclair Ensemb'

Ah!
Yo
Les insectes sont back dans l’hood
A’ec des ailes sur leurs back
On est deux sur un bat
Pause!
On est des super mâles, nos femelles restent super fortent
Les yeux globuleux pognés d’un moustiquaire de porte
Enlevé la glue su’l corps du vizzers de tizzerre
Ou c’est qui s’cache l’hiver?
En train d’traverser la rue, séché, pas peur de die
Notre nombre fait qu’on mourra pas

[Eman]
Bugs, bugs, everything bugs
Rajoute queq’ picots sul’ Dodge
100 mille dans l’croche
Thugs
Appelle pas ton boss si tu fox ou si tu vois des couleuvres qui s’approchent
Pour une p’tite puce punaise, une p’tite mouche à banane
C’est moins facile si t’es t’une p’tite bibitte vulnérable
C,est bin plus fat si t’as des ailes su ton back dans l’hood
Mais check pour les rubans à mouches
Là t’as les coquerelles qui patrouillent, fais pas trop l’andouille
Check où c’est qu’tu passes la vadrouille
Damphousse
J’ai des bugs à moi qui sont encore pognés dans [fousse]
Roule en moto pogné dans bouche

Sapien gruge ce pain, pause

Desfois j’m’éternise
Si j’ai un doute l’anthrobitus l’éclaircit
Super mâle, nos femelles sont super fortes
J’veux juste voir un [probaticus] sur un super-boss

When I fall in love I get dizzied
I fall out there's just dirt to dish
A memory to drown me in

Still, can't regret my big scene
Though I acted the fool
My double became a real has-been

Now that we say our goodbyes
No need for rushing
Crocodiles, crocodiles

When I fall in love I get dizzied
I fall out there's just dirt to dish
A memory to drown me in

Tried my best to act cool
Through the roughest weather
Had no queues

Still, can't regret my big scene
Though I acted the fool
My double became a real has-been

Be there! (then I would say) funny
How you become what you've seen too much of
So I might have been

Now that we say our goodbyes
No need for rushing
Crocodiles, crocodiles

The picketer told us
""Don't kill your kid""
In another word we didn't
But in this one we did
The drunk words of the Jesus freak
Made me dream about our baby
The blunt force of a man's belief
Makes me dream of what we buried
I held your hand as our girl was born
She had your mouth and she had my eyes
We taught her to sing, to sing
And how to play piano
By your side I held your hand
By your side I stood like a man
We raised up a righteous seed to heaven
We raised up a righteous seed together
The picketer told us
""Don't kill your kid""
In another word we didn't
But in this one we did
The drunk words of the Jesus freak
Made me dream about our baby
The blunt force of a man's belief
Makes me dream of what we buried
By your side as our boy was born
We've lost our new little glistening friend
Not in love, never in love
No longer even lovers
Still I held your hand as a friend
Still I stood by you as a friend
We raised up a righteous seed to heaven
We raised up a righteous seed together
The picketer told us
""Don't kill your kid""
In another word we didn't
But in this one we did
The drunk words of the Jesus freak
Made me dream about our baby
The blunt force of a man's belief
Makes me dream of what we buried
God knows we did no wrong
But something has died
Thank God we have a choice
But something has died
I'm by your side if you need to cry
God knows we did no wrong
But something has died
Thank God we have a choice
But something has died
I'm by your side if you need to cry
I'm by your side if you need to cry
I'm by your side if you need to cry
I'm by your side if you need to cry...

J'reste fidèle au pot, c'est ma seule drogue
J'fais rien d'autre à part un ptit peu d'mush
J'adore le money
À soir on get wavy

[1er couplet: KenLo]
Des fois j'partais cold, après 3 in a row
Gros keep shootin', passe le mot
Twenty somethin' years old
Ah comme le temps est bon avec ta blonde !
À l'aimait la musique qui fait des gros booms elle aussi, elle aussi
Danser jusqu'à c'que son bunda finisse rouge baie de goji
Langue à Yoshi
No joke un matin tu l'as commandé pis on te l'a envoyée comme sur eBay
C'tait genre à l'entrée d'une animalerie, allons-y !
Babouine allo

Alaclair High en l'an 16

Mais connais-tu un click de postrigodonneux
Qui a autant d'sainte saveur suave que ça ? Moi non
Si t'as ça, envoie-moi ça
Chu ben ouvert, m'a en faire une cérémonie dans mon salon
Mais y a rien d'nouveau endssoure des ovnis
Ni des lampadaires ouverts, Jah know

Alaclair High, en l'an 13
On est officiellement rendu dans la gang des mononcs
Mais connais-tu un autre groupe de scélérats québécois
Qui jamais n'a à dire, mononc
Avant j'étais bullied
Maintenant c'est moi qui fais les tire-totons
On aurait pu s'égarer
Pis s'retrouver avec les pires pas bons
Alaclair High, ça fait 15 ans qu'on s'la pète
Jamais on va switcher, non non
Mais connais-tu une autre gang de mâles dominants
Découpés comme des fuckin forgerons
Avant j'tais dans l'potager
Maintenant chu un cornichon
J'aurais voulu m'revenger
Mais dans l'fond c'est toute bon

[5e couplet: Kenlo]
Ben dans l'ombre, comme la nymphe est
Pu personne parle d'exté, d'inté
Pose pas d'question, roll up, blaze it
Au moins c't'été, y'aura pas neigé dehors
I know you like it
Même si Facebook a fuck ton concept de like it
Back sur le corna
Un ti canard laqué
Ses deux pattes palmées dans ses Nike yaw
Si après l'club, t'as frappé l'afta, bon matin !
Écoute ça avec aucun souvenir de la veille
À part un gros blank
Jamais on aura vu ça du monde pauvre de même
Pas malin
À part quand qu'y est question d'foncer get le pain d'graines de lin
Même la laveuse est dans sécheuse
Pu besoin d'corde à linge
C't'à quel point l'décor de nos ruelles subit des updates
Des fois tu trippes pis t'es comme : hey yo I gotta hate
Mais ça sert à rien d'tripper ou trouver ça lame
Manuel de survie : Prends ça relaxe pis garde ça lowkey, ça lowkey
Des chiffres dans un compte ça fait pas d'nous des banquiers
Chef donkey
Soumis au même retour du balancier quand t'es don't give, ralentis
Les années devant s'annoncent belles comme des tournesols, des jonquilles

[Chorus: Eman]
Pas trop sûr de passer dans l'livre
Quand j'chante, c'est juste pour casser l'ennui
Quand j'sors de chez nous chu mieux d'get money
Sinon j'm'en va juste work pis j'm'en caliss d'être poli
Pas trop sûr de passer dans l'livre
Quand j'chante, c'est juste pour casser l'ennui
Quand j'sors de chez nous chu mieux d'get money

Ah! D’est en ouest pis jusqu’aux extra-terrestres
On est pas les best mais presque
Super fresh pour deux mille queques
Go!

Chu down, chu down
La tank est full
J’connect un peu plus, attire les foules
Saoul ou sobre, j’mac les poulettes
Même ta chick, c’est elle qui m’voulait
J’aurais pu front, mais au fond qui suis-je
Tant qui a des options, moi j’suis libre
On s’permet des failles
Question de vivre un peu, vivre un peu, yeah

[Verse 2: KenLo]
Si tout mon people se lève debout moi chu down
Dès qu’le soundman me dit go moi chu down
Réagis donc si t’es down comme chu down, si ça t’tentes
De fredonner les lyrics de la toune quand tu la bump
Comme: hey yo!
J’peux débarquer juste après l’refrain en
Faisant le move du gars qui sent
Qui a des fourmis din jambes
Si t’es down avec le karma fait clap clap!
Si t’es down avec le maybe wats clap clap!
Si t’es down avec ken to the l-o clap clap!
Pis t’auras fini le track avec les paumes de mains trempes

Si ton arme est de quoi qu’on peut chanter moi chu down
Si l’monde avec toi au moins sont pas fake moi chu down
Pis si tu nous ramènes de quoi à puffer ben moi chu down

De quoi qui sonne dope moi chu down
De quoi qu’tu peux dire c’est l’truc moi chu down

Yo!

On pourrait s’acheter des clothes moi chu moi chu down
Tu feel tu le track à date ? moi chu moi chu down
Est-ce que le joint est à point ? ouin moi chu down
On devrait suivre l’instinct de swang dans la danse
Bam de la jambe, Brenda saigne de la hanche

[Intro: KenLo]
Yeah! D’est en ouest pis jusqu’au balcon d’ta tante Pierrette
Si t’en envie d’arrêter faut pas qu’t’arrête
Continue d’continuer pendant qu’on avance en mode turbo dans l’vide
Montre-moi c’qui t’reste de bass pis d’acide dans pile
Whadadadang!

[Verse 1: Ogden]
Salutations mesdemoiseaux et mesdames
Je vous souhaite tous bienvenue dans la cabane
J’avais quelques petites choses à vous dire avant de commencer
Vous n’aurez plus jamais besoin de changer
Vos batteries si la révolution se passe comme on l’avait dit
L’autre après-midi sur le banc d’parc
Les piles comprises vont annuler la dépense wack
De donner de d’l’énergie à c’qui devrait en avoir
Pour moi c’est interdit pour un artiste
De pas savoir juste autocarburer sur la piste
Dépasse tout le monde, rend les compétiteurs asthmatiques
Tu gouttes à ma ballistique
Biologico-technique, je suis un accumulateur électrique
Projecteur machiavélique qui déclenche chez les spectateurs un labeur épileptique
Là t’as peur et j’explique
1-2, que le rap est un peu un jeu
Pour ceux qui savent énergiser un feu, whoa!
Brun, bleu, dans la tête des gens
Je pénètre les tympans, cinglant
Cause des dommages qui comptent pour 5 ans
De réparation à domicile avec un ingénieur spécialisé dans les circuits survoltés, woman!
Ça l’air ben trop fucké mais j’avoue qu’c’est pas pire, yeah
Check, check
On a de l’ouvrage comme des insectes
On inspecte le territoire à la quète de vitamines
Et minéraux essentiels
Je baisse mon corps et m’incline devant la divinité
De la rythmique séquentielle
La pile étant celle dans l’h.i.p h.o.p
Mais quelle belle aubaine
Toutes les piles sont déjà là pis sont ben trop pleines!

[Verse 2: Eman]
Tu m’aurais donné l’choix j’t’aurais dit non
Non plus oui c’tu égal dans l’fond?
Vaut mieux stimuler l’énergie pour arriver au front
Prêts, ready comme des enfants à qui on passe un ballon
J’ai dû faire le tour du globe pour aller au dépanneur
Comme quoi faut savoir le time pour demander quelle heure
Nous c’est piles comprises si t’as bien compris
Pas b'soin d’acheter d’batteries le stock est dans machine
On est là, que des humains, la fine pointe de la magie
Nous on déchire, on crie
Sans micro, jusqu’à Paris
Juste des ronds dans l’street comme Ogden l’a dit
Montre-moi c’que t’as dans l’ventre
J’vais découvrir qui j’suis
Tu croyais que j’tait ici mais chu sur St-Cyrille
Lock down le boulevard comme en guerre civile
Tu m’cherches encore pis j’t’en train d’sourire
J’t’à Montréal coin Peel, mon gars, Peeeel!
Reste cool
Tu veux t’payer n’bouffe au resto
Va falloir faire du temps comme les dudes à Bordeaux
Non
Non c’est vrai qui a des jobs dehors
Mais j’me sens comme un esclave qui pars à l’île de Gorée
Encore, le poids d’la ville sur mon corps
J’voulais m’tirer dans rivière mais j’attendais ton call, hmm
Fuck that, tout l’temps pluggé pourtant
L’ordi buggait pis t’es parti comme un gars qui a pu d’dents
Si faut séparer l’homme de la machine
La connerie d’la manchette
Le bon sens d’la folie
Comme si pour défricher y m’fallait une machette
J’ai des dents, pis des bras, pis surtout une pensée claire et nette
Cyfo ça y faut l’faire cypher
Juste pour savoir c’qu’on vaut sans silence
Juste au moment où la seconde devient si lente
C’est élastique
J’écrase mes batteries sur le ciment

[Verse 3: Maybe Watson]
Tu m’aurais dis Maybe Wats, j’t’aurais dis bon
Quessé tu veux encore
Que j’freestyle, c’est non
Bon ok une tite shotte, mais après c’est dodo
Pis si tu chiales encore
T’auras pas d’biberon
Thon fume thon et marine dans son propre jus
Le vendeur hippie à sec a forcément pas d’but
Moi j’ai l’genre de flava sur le marché qui s’offre pu
Amusant, sweet et craquant comme un goglu, word!
Dans l’street, mais pas au Rialto
Tu peux m’croiser avec Loe dans un freestyle flow
Les piles sont comprises
J’ai rien d’un G.I. Joe
Si j’diss ta corpulence, ça reste amical gros
Me, my, moe
Catch moi au cinéma
Avec une forty din pants
Du weed din bas, pis j’paye pas
Passque j’connais le gaaaaars
On s’est rencontré back in the days dans un Posdnuos show
Yo! Lors du test de dépistage du dopest tag
Gros sevrage, côte Sherbrooke, SubV line up à Copenhague
Party mix, DJ No Request et le Flavor Wave
Magic bullet, bullet ! pis shake un leg
Break a leg, wake and bake
Bouche sèche, Gatorade, 2 toasts pour le déjeuner
Peanut butter paper chase puisque c’est l’été
Snatch ton pod tous les weak joints sont délétés
Snatch ton pod tous les weak joints sont délétés
À un point tel que j’ai eu besoin de l’répéter
Yo, yo! Hey yo sont tellement weak tes tracks
J’snatch ton ipod pis j’delete tes tracks
Estie qu’t’es wack !

[Outro: Maybe Watson]
Yo!
Les piles sont comprises
Pour l’année 2006, jusqu’à l’année 2012 m.f.s
You know what it is
C’est ton host Maybe Wats
Un gros shout à Cyfo sur le cypher aka Ogdizzy
Pis Eman de Accrophizzo
Qc, Mountreal, now put your hands in the air !
You know what it is, live street battle shit !
Gros shout out à Word up !

Ah man! c’te joint-là y est wack!
Enlève ça de ton ipod!  Biatch

Fussy fuss, c'est le fussy fuss

Yo! Alaclair Ensemble

Mount real to Quebec. Check it!

Maybe Wats

[Verse 1: Maybe Watson]
You can’t fuss with us, eh yo t’es sotte
Un virgin dans un porn, t’es un awkward fuck
You’re all shook up
Havoc a un loaded biscuit dans la bouche du king
T’es mieux de walk with us
Lâche des bulldogs, harass ton full squad
Alaclair high c’est des altitude rocks
Pleure pas, chu pas du tout mad at you dawg
Tu subis les ravages que mon petit bully attitude cause


[Verse 2: KenLo]
Eh yo ya cyan’t fuss with us
J’comme wicked même quand j’fausse une note
La bassline te décompose tu d’viens un gros tas d’os
Comme quand un oiseau s’pose dans l’haut d’un post
Une aile noire pis un reflet rose sur l’autre
Qui annonce que l’aube est proche
Ton essai d’essayer d’refuser tombe à l’eau tu l’flush
T’as peur d’une dope dont t’as jamais osé toke une puff
Alaclair nous autres on a la dopest sauce, on arrose le plat
Most qui l’écoute voudrait quit mais ça fonctionne pas
Sans aucune force, j’débloque chaque défaut
Du prochain rush de mots
Le plus beau jamais sorti du fond d’une gorge
Poésie réincarnée c’t'impossible qu’a finisse morte
Alaclair, street shit chaud collé en dessous d’tes bottes


[Verse 3: Eman]
Eh yo ya can’t fuss with us
Ta tête est une pognée d’porte
T’as l’esprit serrure, pis tu résonnes comme une cloche
Suis nos pas, tu vas finir dans des endroits louches
À te demander kimo kush
En fumant du qui m’écoute
Alaclair c’est la fuckin drogue
T’es là perdu, tu t’grattes les bras
T’attends juste qu’on t’apporte l’album
La grosse affaire, du jamais vu depuis les pyramides
On revient sur terre, avec des vaisseaux beaucoup plus rapides
T’es dépassé, on a fini c’qu’on avait à faire
Gradués en 2012 pendant qu’tu copiais l’dictionnaire
Les MCs vont rester doux comme des ti pitous
C’est Alaclair, chien sal, qui run things un point c’est tout
Ya can’t fuss, chu ben trop l’boss
T’es en retard, t’as raté l’dernier métrobus
Yaow ! Fini ti wee semi groupie t’as des guidi-guidi pousse pas trop
C’est moi qui écris les raps du gars dans Degrassi


[Verse 4: Maybe Watson]
Can’t fuss with us original mange un char de marde
Écoute ce beat de Ken dawg, mais pour ton safety lâche le crack
Quand tu bob ton head, on dirait que tu mâches une graine
Cheap shot, mais ta petite twat est soft est saine
T’es fuckin lourd, j’te laisse tomber
Ça vaut pas la peine
Respect le son raw que les gods amènent
Yao! eh yo je sais où t’habites bitch
Fuck around et je mocy ta vitre

C'est le fussy fuss
Fussy fussy fuss, fussy fussy fuss, fussy fussy fuss

[Outro: KenLo]
Alaclair sur le beat f-fuss dessus
Fuss dessus, fuss dessus
Si t’en t’entends du wack shh--
On est pas dessus, pas dessus, pas dessus
Alaclair sur le beat f-fuss dessus
Fuss dessus, fuss dessus
Si t’en t’entends du wack shit
On est pas dessus, pas dessus, pas dessus

Ah! (Keep on, keep on)

OohoohohohohooOOohohoohO!
J’fais des cauchemars
J’fais des cauchemars
J’fais des cauchemars

[Verse 1: Maybe Watson]
Maman ya un vieux dude bedonnant boutonneux
Qui est rentré dans la maison
Pour tuer mon hamster
J’le frappe, j’y rentre dins doigts dins yeux
Ça y fait rien
C’est un peu comme si j’étais rien
J’pars à courir, au début tout est cool
Mais j’ai l’impression d’marcher
Dans une piscine du nouilles
J’arrive à l’école, sac troué
Mes livres tombent
J’ai un t-shirt, mais plus de pantalons
J’cache mon pénis
J’demande à tout l’monde pour des culottes
Qui à l’école a amené une pair de culottes en extra
C’est lundi, ya pas d’gym, caliss
Tout l’monde me regarde
Et me pointe en rire
Hey! J’ai une BMW
Je sais pas pourquoi, mais est là, pis je l’ai
Hey! J’ai l’goût d’ride pis j’ai les clés
C’est vraiment dommage
Que j’aie pas d’permis d’chauffer
Sweaty j’attends en ligne pour refaire mon primaire
On doit tous le faire
Une loi qui est passée hier
J’ai peur de l’examen
J’cherche quelqu’un que j’connais pour tricher avec
Comme Alfredo et Toto
(Dans Cinema Paradisio)

[Refrain: Maybe Watson/KenLo]
J’fais des cauchemars
Des vilains cauchemars

[Verse 2: KenLo]
Chaque goutte de pluie
Est comme une spirale de chromosomes
Caché derrière j’ai une vue sur le tueur
Pis y m’erssemble
Plus j’m'approche, plus j’recule
Même que desfois j’arrête
Les trois dimensions respirent
C’qui reste dans l’poumon d’la bête
H’h… h’h.. l’air y manque
Mais j’pourrais pas dire
Si j’suis dans une rue sombre
Ou devant l’miroir de ma chambre
Motifs rouges sur ma chemise
À mesure que l’sang spread
Ya du fil pis une aiguille
Qui m’cousent mon ventre man
J’essaille de marcher jusqu’au prochain coin d’rue
Mais l’prochain coin d’rue
C’est l’même que celui d’avant man
Chaque goutte de pluie
Est comme une spirale de chromosomes
Ohm

Un cauchemar...

J’me nourris au Nourcy
(Des puddings aux sourcils
Viens toucher mon ours qui)
Écoute toujours Bouscotte
(En fait elles sont tous poches)
Et donc tu l’abuses pas
(Yo! Ça touche personne sauf Paul)
Ça y donne des goose bumps
(Et si la grosse madame montée d’l’escalier ne brise pas)
Alors c’est inutile de vouloir parler de Brisebois
Et yo ça t’dérangerais-tu de me passer des rizzla
(Ben non voyons ce genre de choses-là gros tu m’avises pas)
Dans ma cuisine, les électro-ménagers me chicotent
(On va au parc Safari faire un p’tit tour de cygogne)
Mais j’adore mais tu me le dis tusuite si tu feel pas
Le genre de puff à 5 mouillée du Carré d’Youville, son

Les sous-marins avec meatballs
(Le sandwich américain qu’on déguste avec sauce forte)
Le couloir de mon building est rempli avec des gros toughs
(Faque si tu viens chez nous, t’es mieux de cogner à l’autre porte)
Pis si je viens chez vous, chu mieux de pogner Allô-Stop
Les tarifs de bus voyageur sont trop up, je go nuts
On pourrait toujours essayer de switcher ce flow-là
Comme l’erreur d’la pouponnière qui fait que t’es un autre gars
J’imagine mon papa dire ''yo! le bébé me ressemble pas!
Mais c’t’un humain comme un autre faque j’le prends là pis j’y repense pas''
Les temps changent
Mais pas seuls comme les bébés
C’est pass chu dans la lune que t’as GHB mon café
Et quand on est ensemble j’veux m’arracher pour le passé
Les soirées en larmes et les tables de céramique que j’ai cassé
Assez de looser talk, on s’habille et on joue dehors
À se pitcher le boomerang, même si j’ai des fous devoirs
La mémoire nous torture avec des souvenirs qu’on ya enfoncés
Tu t’rappelles back in the days quand on s’était pas rencontrés
Demande-moi pas si ça va bien, tout l’monde répond oui
Chu satisfait de l’équilibre que j’ai comme Raymond Vi



Laaaa-la-laaaa

1, 1-2
Eh yo regarde combien ça va vite
Des cartes à puce au cannabis
Des coins louches où personne habite
Le ventre plein, les pensées vides
C’qui est plat a l’air d’une pente oblique, on vit une chute
On parle pu d’céréales quand on parle de blé
Comment va l’économie, ton doe rappelle-toi où tu l’as mis
Desfois c’est comme un
Club auquel on se s’rait tous abonnés
Pas besoin d’tout mastiquer
T’as juste à gobber
L'image de toi même rabaissé
À la grosseur d’un scarabée
Des problèmes à escalader, never surprised
Cause you know tomorrow’s not a better day
Dialoguer a pas réussi, ça donne envie d’parler moins
Moi j’me rappelle
J't’ai dehors
Dans l’cadre
Pas dans classe
Les devoirs
C’tait comme ha!
On va voir ça plus taw
J’note ma taille dans l’cadre de la porte de ma [chambre]
Des légumes pis d’la viande qui s’entassent dans mes membres
Pis fosho j’va prendre 5 pouces minimum
Pis dépasser la ligne de la porte de ma chambre

Yo! Ah!
Eh yo original
Soucieux personnage
Dans ton paysage
Dope shit drogue
Caca line c'pour les orignals

T’es triste pis tu vieillis mal
Very mad en anglais ton avion d’papier atterit mal
Terribale
Straight franco queb north américane
On l’fait comme on l’fait, c’est du véritable
Sorbonne 14 créole joual presque inimitable
Tu veux des vitamines, mais tu passes en dssoure d’la table
Tu m’diss, pis j’te diss
Pis on s’fait des acollades
En direct du berceau mondial
Inter-hipsteral
Globalisation des moustaches
On est propre mais on s’habille sale
Semi-stable, j’fais du cash mais je l’dépense en innocent
J’ball dans les bars, pis j’emprunte pour des imodiums

J’suis perdu mais dis-moi pourquoi mon cerveau est (migrateur)

2003, Lord Finesse
Yo
On avait beaucoup plus qu’une année à jouer sur replay
Mais fallait pas parler de ce mélo que vous viviez
Y avait peut-être une annonce pour un poteau dévissé
Le chalet était pu bon pour le peuple selon squeezay
Channel collectionneuse d’enveloppes bien grattées au sweepstake
Jamais c’est ce qu’elle avait dit juste avant de squeezer
J’savais qu’elle allait allaiter le nom de ce beat, man
Queque chose qui donne le goût de flow sur figaro sweet, man
Avec des fonds, se l’approprie, effectue mon tweek bap
Connecté dope, on absolument focus
Un nid d’guêpes
Les portes du monde me tapent
Aussi le piment de Montignac
Mes betteraves pis ma salade
Je les garde mon p’tit snack
Les MPC le font avec le son sur les teen pads
Onyx back in the days mon favrite track c’était Mean Jack
J’allais finir le verse avec un quote qui veut tout dire
Un genre de copy-paste d’un rapper mort
Qui reste fou real



Ha-ha-ha! (…)


[Skit: Maybe]
Eeeeeh, un album-référence en matière de hip-hop québécois?
Pour moi j'dirais que l'album Mentalité moune morne de  Accrophone, c'est vrai qu'ça été une de mes grosses influences
J'aime bien la lourdeur des beats, quoi! Les flows saccadés

Silent hope, ...
Just a little time he ...
Our kind
Just a little time till sun burns the song
The night magically dies
So when you're close to me
I can see, I feel you moving
All around me, it's sparkling halos
Make so many colors, only naked eyes can see
... all learn to fly
Uhu, take a chance this time
Know I'm ... bring you... fire
On ... see me, you
When Mark and I say
Whoa, somebody down to...
So when you're close to me
I can see, I feel you moving
All around me, you like the rain
When falling to the river, floating to the see
Uh yeah, ... shifting, brought to life
We're rearranging space and time
No one cares but you
Starting the fire, when Mark and I save you
When Mark and I save
Whoa, somebody down to...
Like a ... from, ... find your way to me
Like a prisoner towards the light I'll extend my reach
Sending pictures with ... tell me what do you see?
Can you see it? Can you see it?

I tracked things to the simplest form
And found the beloved to be adored
And tried, I really did my best!
Crumbling towers that are meant to fall
Better try to rearrange it all
Shapes wouldn’t fit together…

Maybe it’s safer to live in paper
And my eyes are full of sky
That’s why are they maybe blue
And I was born to fly away
I was born to fly
Uh, uh, uh!
Do, do, do, do
Colour, costumes, feathers and paint
What a one tower mountains are made of clay
… and burnt, I know you’re…
I picture myself somewhere in Japan
In a white room watching the spinning fan
I tried with all my mind to please you!

Chorus:
Maybe it’s safer to live in paper
And my eyes are full of sky
That’s why are they maybe blue
And I was born to fly away
I was born to fly

Soft as the night…
Silent falls across the wall
He’s to be …

Love ... make me ...don't let me down
Summer love, dead in the winter, returning to the ground
And know the ocean always swirling...
... just a song
Wu-hu, summer ... it's all that I know
Time is now, necklace that you can hold or let go of
Know the world outside is calling, and we stop time
With just a song
We down in the ocean, things we never seen
So are you imagine, on the wave's that I'll be
Give you my heart, soft as...
Dance on my waves, are we ... uuuh
Into the waves
Dark smile, passing my window, heart beating fast
... down, tell me good things last
With just a song
We down in the ocean, things we never seen
So are you imagine, on the wave's that I'll be
Give you my heart, soft as...
Dance on my waves, are we ... uuuh, we'll do that baby
Into the waves

Dark never came
And we spoke in the sand 'til we ran out of things to say
Oh no, and they served you on a plate;
They were frowning and bowing their heads like birds of prey
Oh no, I was taking my time while the stars aligned
You were holding my hand like a bottle
'til it tingled right down to the tips and then it shattered our bones!
Are you at peace when you're feeding the beast?
Wherever we go, in the darkness
Solemn and content to die alone
But other people, in the darkness
Cowering their heads and dyin' alone
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ooh ooh!
Nightly attacks; rip the meat from your back
And we're sleeping warm and close
Oh no, you've been feeding it your ideas
Even though it doesn't like the taste
'Cause they burn, and they grow
While you're waiting outside on your sister's roof
For the light to stream out of the garden
I was lying facedown in an empty pool
As the rain falls hard on the bottom
And you're wasting our time, if you can't be kind
And I'll take the flashlight down to the basement, and it'll swallow me whole!
Blood on your face, you were born for the chase
Wherever we go, in the darkness
Counting sins and taking things of size
Wherever we go, in the darkness
Mowing fins and breaking limbs in time
Wherever we go, in the darkness
Nothing's gonna ease your worried mind
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ooh ooh!

There was a man named Jack who rode upon a golden calf
And he brought great joy to all the little girls and boys
He suffered endlessly for what he couldn't help but see
The great hypocrisy of a rented world

Oh oh

There was a glowing preacher who reached a closed empire
Something that never was something that could never be
He came one day that no one saw ???????
And everybody cheered and stood in all

Looking out more ????? paradise
It's all ?????? sacrifice
The great ?????????
Dancing for free in a rented world

Do what you want be who you want to be

What the night pulls in
Even if she says, ""no""
I won't let go

Open your heart to me
Don't believe the tricks
That is tangling my sleeve
There are no mirrors here
I am who I am

The instinct of the way ?

Before he stays
Less than you seemed
The greatest of the wings

The day official plays
When they covered the door
I like to see her face yeaaaah

I make spit shit jealous for me
But no one cares when I hit the ground

So keep cause on 34th street

He said baby what’s the big deal
Feel what you wanna feel
Say what you’re gonna say
You’re gonna die one day
For example I could kiss you
Just because I want to
What’s the difference if you turn away
I’m gonna die one day
Why do you waste your time
Thinkin bout your reputation
Trying to meet an expectation
Wonderin what they’re gonna say
When everyone you ever known
Is headed for a headstone
I don’t wanna give the end away
But we’re gonna die one day
Your body is an animal
Doesn’t ask for much
A little music and a soft touch
Why don’t you let it out to play
Your heart is in a bird cage
Singing in your chest
You wanna shut it up, but give it a rest
You’re gonna die one day
Why do you waste your time
Thinkin bout an obligation
Runnin from a confrontation
Wonderin what you oughtta say
When everyone you ever known
Is headed for a headstone
I don’t wanna give the end away
But we’re gonna die one day
So baby what’s the big deal
If you wanna be free
Say what you wanna feel
And spend the night with me
I’m gonna take you up in my arms
And if we must go down
We’ll go singin to the smoke alarms
We’ll dance into the ground

I saw you standing in a crowded room
It’s a long time later but it’s still too soon
And it’s not like everything you did was wrong
Baby I loved you
But we stayed together too long
Baby it was not bad, isn’t like I’d take it back
You and I had quite a lot of fun in fact
And its not like anything went really wrong
Baby I loved you
But we stayed together too long
Now that it’s all over and you’re saving face
You say you wanna be my friend
But I don’t know what I saw in you in the first place
And I hope I never ever have to see you again
I took my books back, records from the bedroom shelf
It was a small flat, now you got it to yourself
I know that probably I did you wrong
Baby I’m sorry
But we stayed together too long
Now that it’s all over and you’re saving face
You say you wanna be my friend
But I don’t know what I saw in you in the first place
And I hope I never ever have to see you again
It isn’t my fault we were never meant to be
It isn’t your fault I can tell you honestly
We knew it when we started there was something wrong
We should’ve known better
But we stayed together too long
Now that it’s all over and you’re saving face
You say you wanna be my friend
But I don’t know what I saw in you in the first place

Sittin in the backseat waitin for your brother
To come back from the gas station
Said hardly anything to one another
Cus it seemed like an awkward situation
I got nothin against your girlfriend
She seemed perfectly sweet and everything
But I wish I woulda met you back in the old days
When you were a free man
You say you gave your hand away
But that don’t mean
That I can’t take it
Just for a minute and
I say I’m sick of love
But that don’t mean
That we can’t make it
I wanna make it with you
It’s a really long drive back to the city
And your brother doesn’t talk a lot
And I wasn’t gonna ask you anything personal
But I guess I just forgot
Cus I get a little antsy sittin in the backseat
Starin at your tattoos
Oh, we both know its a battle of will
And I don’t like to lose
You say you gave your hand away
But that don’t mean
That I can’t take it
Just for a minute and
I say I’m sick of love
But that don’t mean
That we can’t make it
I wanna make it with you
It isn’t that you’re so incredible
I don’t event think you’re smart
It isn’t that you’re unforgettable
I don’t wanna steal your heart
Baby its an invitation
Maybe just a one night stand
I don’t wanna a conversation
I don’t wanna make you my man
You say you gave your hand away
But that don’t mean
That I can’t take it
Just for a minute and
I say I’m sick of love
But that don’t mean
That we can’t make it

When he walked in his eyes were shining
Shining like a gun
His swagger was a force of nature
Humbling everyone
His mouth was on his cigarette
His hand was on her leg
He hit her like an avalanche
He hit her like the plague
He said hey now honey, you look so pretty
Do you wanna go home with me
She said no, but maybe you could give me a lift
He’s no good and she oughtta know better
But she don’t know it yet
And oh, to know him, she’ll die a little death
When she got in her heart was beating
Like a baseball bat
It churned her blood to buttermilk
It fought her like a cat
His hands were on the steering wheel
Her eyes were on his face
And grinning like a criminal
He drove her to her place
He said hey now honey, you look so pretty
Will you let me go home with you
She said no, but her whole body said yes
He’s no good and she oughtta know better
But she don’t know it yet
And oh, to know him, she’ll die a little death
When they got out the air was heavy
Heavy as a sin
It filled her head like bourbon
And she asked him to come in
He took her like a devil
There was venom on his breath
She bit in like an apple
And she died a little death
He said hey now honey, you look so pretty
But i gottta be someplace
She said no, baby don’t leave me like this

And give it away
There ain’t no way out
Of sayin what you wanna say
I’ll promise I can take it
If promisin will make you
Just lay it all out on the floor
Cus I don’t wanna be lonely no
I don’t wanna be lonely no more
The truth is a stone
That sits on your tongue
And when I’m alone
I’m never so numb
So if you are gonna fake it
Or you’d rather play it safe
Say the word and I’ll show you the door
I don’t wanna be lonely though
I don’t wanna be lonely no more
Some part of me knows
It rattles and crows
From under my ribs
Baby say it ain’t so
Or if it is so
Baby say that it is
Come on and say what it is
Open your mouth
And give it to me
Keepin it shut is a kick to the gut
So how bad can it be?
I’ll promise I can take it
If promisin will make you
Just lay it all out on the floor
Cus I don’t wanna be lonely no
I don’t wanna be lonely no more

We all know a man can be a delicate thing
He can be soft and sweet like sugar wrapped in butter
And I don’t mind your company but if you wanna make me sing
Keep in mind that I am not your mother
Show me something I can rely on
Or I would rather be alone
You give your heart but I wanna see your
Backbone
Every time you talk to me there’s worry in your eyes
I wonder what on earth could you be so afraid of
I ain’t gonna hurt you honey, I ain’t even half your size
Step on up and show me what you’re made of
Show me something I can rely on
Or I would rather be alone
You give your heart but I wanna see your
Backbone
Baby, I know what I’m lookin for
I don’t wanna ask you anymore
Honey, I’ve already conquered all I can
I just wanna be a woman
All you gotta be’s a man
This is how it’s always been, and it is this way still
It isn’t something we need to debate
You say you’re gonna please me, but I don’t see how you will
When you can’t even stand up straight
Show me something I can rely on
Or I would rather be alone
You give your heart but I wanna see your
Backbone

I don’t wanna be alone in this bed
Won’tcha give me somethin I can take apart
I don’t wanna listen to the yellin in my head
Or the cryin of my idiot heart
Idiot heart
I shoulda left you at home
You gimme nothin but hard love, bad luck
When you gonna leave me me alone?
He was a dark-eyed man and I knew right away
It was gonna take a turn for the worst
So I said ‘hey, heart, if you’re gonna go crazy
Give a little warning first”
Idiot heart
I shoulda left you at home
You gimme nothin but hard love, bad luck
When you gonna leave me me alone?
Ooh, you’re an idiot
A lunatic a nitwit
And you make a fool outta me
Oh, you’re a sad sack
Subtle as a heart attack
Hey heart, when you gonna let me be?
Well it doesn’t take a lot to get you started
And I don’t know how to turn you back off
I guess there ain’t no rest for the idiot-hearted
Until your heart finally stops
Idiot heart
I shoulda left you at home
You gimmme nothin but hard love, bad luck
When you gonna leave me me alone?
Idiot heart
I guess I really shoulda known
You gimmme nothin but hard love, bad luck
When you gonna leave me alone?
You gimmme nothin but hard love, bad luck
Hey, heart: leave me alone

Lovin you’s like kissin a chicken
Baby it’s a one way street
Kissin you’s like lickin a lemon
You’re so sour it’s sweet
You got a heart like a wildcat
If you love me, I really don’t know
But I got a heart like a steel trap
Never gonna let you go
Oh, how happy we’ll be
When you finally fall for me
Lovin you’s like a hungry belly
Empty as a whiff of smoke
Kissin you’s like an open deli
When I’m completely broke
You got a heart like a wire cage
I got a heart like a bird
All day long it sings your praise
But I don’t think you’ve heard
Oh, how happy we’ll be
When you finally fall for me
I run to you like rain to a river
Like a river to the sea
But you’re so cold it makes me shiver
When you gonna run to me?
Obviously we need one another
Baby I’m your biggest fan
What part of being meant for each other
Do you not understand?
Oh, how happy we’ll be
When you finally fall for me

Love ain’t patient, love ain’t kind
Love can’t lead you, love is blind
Love will make you lose your mind
But love is all we got
Love ain’t honest, love ain’t true
Love does things it ought not do
It lies and steals and cheats on you
But love is all we got
What’s that feeling, makes you sick?
What’s that cuts you to the quick?
What’s that habit you can’t kick?
It’s love
And it’s the only thing you know
Love is clumsy, love ain’t smart
Seems so harmless at the start
Then trips and falls and breaks your heart
But love is all we got
Love is vulgar, love is lewd
Love don’t care who’s in the mood
Love leaves you lonely in the nude
But love is all we got
Who’s that drunkard at your door?
Who’s that scoundrel you adore?
Beats you and you beg for more
That’s love
But where you gonna run to?
Love ain’t pretty, love is tough
Love fights dirty, love plays rough
Don’t matter whether love’s enough
Cus love is all we got

"
62911,"

I’m not here to apologize
Don’t give me that look in your eyes
There’s nothin worse than a man
Who thinks he knows
I’ll tell you the honest truth
I’m not scared to like in my youth
Now that we both know
Exactly what we chose
Oh, this is hard love
Oh, this is hard love
We don’t mean to be
As mean as we all are
But love is hard
These worries inside my head
They’re louder than what you said
And I can’t find
A window or a door
I try calling out to you
But they’re yelling inside you, too
So it’s hard to say
What all our talk is for
Oh, this is hard love
Oh, this is hard love
We don’t mean to be
As mean as we all are
But love is hard
Have I done nothing right?
Lying here every night
Tryin to be good to you
You know I do my best
I lift up my tiny voice
It seems like the only choice
Trying to sing above
The roarin of loneliness
Oh, this is hard love
Oh, this is hard love
We don’t mean to be
As mean as we all are
But love is hard

You've told him lies now for so long
Yet still he's ready to forgive
He's got you back and that's all he wants
A lot more than I'm left with

You don't care now that you're gone
But do you know how much I miss you?
It's not fair after all you've done
That I'm so...I still want to kiss you

And throwing presents straight away
Because you could never take them home
Always scared what he might say
But always leaving me alone

You don't care, now that you're gone
But do you know how much I miss you?
It's not fair after all you've done
That I'm so... I still want to kiss you

You told him what he wants to hear
And so you got another chance
But I was yours for seven years
Is that what you call a dalliance?

You don't care, now that you're gone
But do you know how much I miss you?
It's not fair after all you've done
That I'm so... I still want to kiss you

"
63040,"

You've never mentioned this before
It seems I'm always last to know
And do I have to guess how you're going to feel each day
You never had a word to say
You should have told me
I don't understand why you didn't tell me

Surely you must know I hate what I'm doing
I don't want to upset you but it's yourself you're fooling
The last thing I need is part twelve of the row
But just why are you being so reasonable now?

I don't dare answer the phone
And when you call I still pretend that I'm not home
I don't want to see you anymore
Oh love, it's not just me I'm thinking of
No one can change that much in three days
It's not yours to take back!

Surely you must know I hate what I'm doing
I don't want to upset you but it's yourself you're fooling
The last thing I need is part twelve of the row
But just why are you being so reasonable now?

How can you do this to me?
How can you do this to me?
How can you do this to me?
How can you do this to me?

After school, a friendship walking home
We fled across the fields, until we were alone
To a bridge, that stood close by the sea
The day that we spent there, is ours eternally

I don't have to tell you
I'm sure you understand
The first who lay beside me
Made me what I am (oh, she made me what I am)

A smile, in these ungrateful times
Makes all that you left me seem more worthwhile
But no, I couldn't really dare
To show how much I miss you
Isn't that unfair?

I don't have to tell you
I'm sure you understand
The first who lay beside me
Made me what I am (oh you made me what I am)

And no matter how it ends
You should always keep in touch with your friends

"

63044,

No, I sent you that letter
To ask you if the end was worth the means
Was there really no inbetween?

And I still don't feel better
I just wondered if it could be like before
And I think you just made me sure!

But then that's typically you
And I might have been a bit rude
But I wrote it in a bad mood

I'm not being funny with you
But it's hard to be engaging
When the things you love keep changing

Brassneck. Brassneck
I just decided I don't trust you anymore
I just decided I don't trust you anymore

First time you came over
Do you remember you saying that you'd stay for good?
No I didn't think you would

Well we couldn't've been closer
But it was different then, and that's all in the past
There I've said it now at last!

You grew up quicker than me
I kept so many old things
And never quite stopped hoping

I think I know what this means
It means I've got to grow up
It means you want to throw up

Brassneck. Brassneck
I just decided I don't trust you anymore
I just decided I don't love you anymore

I just know, you weren't listening, were you?
Oh please go, whenever you'd prefer to
I said it means a lot, when you use an old phrase
But then so what? We can't have it both ways

I know, you're not bothered, are you?
Even so, I'm not going to argue
He won't object! Keep writing to me
Just don't forget you ever knew me

Everything is in a fog now
Every piece of melting day
I am standing in a cloudy
In a foggy mountain shade

And these black holes
One with me out
Hear again again again
Cause the light of god's retina
Is much stronger than the flame

Everything is in a fog now
Every piece of melting day
I am standing in a cloudy
In a foggy mountain shade

And these black holes
One with me out
Hear again again again
Cause the light of god's retina
Is much stronger than the flame

I will laugh now
With my head back
And create the space from scratch
All the winds and all the beauty
Sometimes fate and sometimes sad

All the star sails and the sailors
Fountain streams connecting yours
Which form networks
Transmit the signals
Sending messages to god

I remember you are standing
With a (?) on your back
Time is healing
Don't be scared now
""I'm too old to wait"", you said

I will laugh then
With my head back
And create the space from scratch
All the winds and all the beauty
Sometimes fate and sometimes sad

Everything is in a fog now
Every piece of melting day
I am standing in a cloudy
In a foggy mountain shade

And these black holes
One with me out
Hear again again again
Cause the light of god's retina
Is much stronger than the flame

Do you hear me?
I am calling
I just know you're there by now
Two steps back and three steps forward
And I'll reach you in my heart

I will laugh then
With my head back
And create the space from scratch
All the winds and all the beauty
Sometimes fate and sometimes sad

I say I don't believe in gods
But I think I can hear them
In the clouds and in your pain
And in this music inside us

I say I don't believe in gods
But when they want us to meet them
They are screaming so loud
Trying to remind us the fog we are in

They are so scary animals
With the voices of trees and stones
Do you hear them?
Do you hear them now?

Do you hear them?
Do you hear them now?

Suspended round, it goes spinning slow
It goes slow

Another holy spaz although with radioactive conjurings
A fearful lord who wipes my brow and licks up all my salt

Then there's the boy, sings those sad songs I like
I've got too many boyfriends to see you tonight
I've got too many boyfriends to see you!

[Verse 1]
October boner, over and out
Oh no, petit-fours
Time for the victory roll
I roll up
A hiccough
The new tan is no tan
Here I am, your swim fan

[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I not your number one goth?
I know you and I'd like to
I know you
Why burn the tape?
Were you scared it would get played?
I caught you in my glass view
I know you

[Chorus]
Hello Magneto, metal coney
You got bronze, you roughed me up
Gold's for the worst guys
You seem real nice

[Verse 2]
Don't get so serious about your band
You guys sure can rock a basement
But I'd rather you dripping out of the pool
Your stroke and your stride
Shoulders libidicide

[Pre-Chorus]
Swim halfway out
Get stuck and float about
I dive in the deep end, I float
And what'd you expect?
Got me drunk on VHS
Let's watch what we caught
What we shot in the dark
And I caught you, I know you, I know you

[Chorus]
Hello Magneto, metal coney
You got bronze, you roughed me up
Gold's for the worst guys
You seem real nice

[Instrumental passage]

[Chorus]
Hello Magneto, metal coney
You got bronze, you roughed me up
Gold's for the worst guys
You seem real nice
It's not stopping

Hello Magneto, metal coney
You got bronze, you fucked me up
I want the bad guys gouging their eyes
What am I saying?
I am the bad guy

[Verse 1]
Show me mine
I'll show you yours
I'm discoverin'
Everybody's got bed sores
Bad or betterin'
Clean the skin or scratch it off
There's no salvagin'
That skin suffering from the rot

In a cave with shallow babes
Acting shallower
Got so sick of moons and waves
Want something muddier

Legs tight squeezed around the knees
Guess I'm going nowhere
Why you wanna pull me out?

[Chorus]
Hack up my thighs
You'll never drag me out alive
Stuck between a rock and another rock that's bigger

And though you look nice I'm staying trapped in this vice
Staring up at the mouth of the cave

[Verse 2]
Was this not the favorite place of other pioneers?
Crazy is as crazy says
I'm not crazy here

For you, or am I just bored?
Staring into an unknown dark
Crazy is, now crazy talks

[Chorus]

You look nice, but I'm gonna take my own advice
Staring up at the mouth of the cave

One, two, tell me your big secret
I got two more reasons not to keep it
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling

Speedy making magic on the speedway
Choose your own adventure
Or your own way to waste
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling

[Chorus]
It's a ghost from a story
And his boo's getting boring
It's a ghost you swear you've seen
But he doesn't haunt anything

Fingerprinting cops put out a query
At a punk show back in hoppers someone asks what it means
To see flies on the ceiling
Mating and molting

If I cast a spell it's 'cause I loved you
And if you're dead I'll still wind up above you
Lay back leave it to me
Check out the ceiling

[Chorus]
It's a ghost from a story
Closing doors draining heat
Gangs cry witches divine
Milk the sheep and put it to sleep

Silhouette serpentine
Take out your belly ring
Eyes an eggy cataract cream
Eye the flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling

I got a girl about five foot one
She got a real short fuse and long shotgun
Shoulda known better that to do her like that
She hit me upside the noggin with a baseball bat
She works all day, she don't lay around
But she likes to rock it when the sun goes down

Oh yeah, she's a red hot motivator
Oh yeah, she's sweet and tough
Oh yeah, she likes to shake that moneymaker
Oh yeah, she's bodacious

My girl stands about five foot four
She got both feet flat on the floor
When the girl's got to have it, she don't take no
She'll grab ahold, and she won't let go
She's as hard headed as a barnyard mule
Moves kind of slow, but she ain't no fool

Oh yeah, she's a red hot motivator
Oh yeah, she's sweet and tough
Oh yeah, she like to shake that moneymaker

Some girls like to lay around and moan
Some girls are restless like a rolling stone
Some girls will leave with a crippling pain
Some girls will have you in a ball and chain

As a kid in Arizona, we didn't have our own team
But I was drawn to the Braves of Aaron, Mathews and Spahn
When we moved to The Bay, I got McCovey, Marichal and Mays
It was heaven and then in '68, the A's came along

With Captain Sal, Reggie, Joe Rudi. and Rollie
Having two teams to love was out of sight
When Seattle became home, spent my nights in the Dome
I still think the Mariners, Giants and A's are all right

A fair weather fan is not what I am
Even though my zip code has changed
I might smile and enjoy where I'm currently employed
Your soul can't be rearranged
It's so hard to understand
It's so hard to understand a fair weather fan

I grew up outside of Minneapolis
Glued to the radio and the '70's Twins
And the sad sound of crying when they didn't
Score enough runs for a Blyleven win

Now I reside in New York City
So I got a little thing for the pinstripes
But when the Twins face the Yanks in the ALDS
You know who this small town girl likes

A fair weather fan is not what I am
Even though my zip code has changed
I might smile and enjoy where I'm currently employed
Your soul can't be rearranged
It's so hard to understand
It's so hard to understand a fair weather fan

And there's bass player Pete, always fast on his feet
No home team, then for sure
He stays fast and loose but if he had to choose
It's be the Washington Senators

I grew up in LA to the sweet sounds of Vin Scully
That's how I went to bed most every night
There ain't a prettier park than the one in Chavez Ravine
I've seen many games by the palm trees and the lights

But I sure do love Manhattan
I took on the AL team after '93
But now that Torre and Mattingly have moved to LA
It makes it so much easier for me

'Cause a fair weather fan is not what I am
Even though my zip code has changed
I might smile and enjoy where I'm currently employed
Your soul can't be rearranged
Oh, it's hard to understand
It's so hard to understand

A fair weather, a fair weather
A fair weather fan
A fair weather fan
A fair weather fan
A fair weather fan

Saw your picture in the paper today and I couldn't believe my eyes
Dead before your time, but so long before your prime
Looking nothing like the memory from when I was a kid
Golden hair flowing down, on your knees grooming the pitcher's mound
And it's always 1976
The camera lies, and the mirror plays tricks
So many things that the years won't fix
Always 1976

Set against a fading Motor City and Richard Nixon's shame
A rock star had arrived
Fidrych comes alive
And I know it's hardly fair to say you won't grow old
But forgive me if I try to keep that faded image in my eyes

What does it say for the rest of us when our heroes die and leave us alone?
What does it say for the rest of us when we wake up and find this bird has flown?

I hope he’s sitting on Planet Rock
And Human League’ing
Block party, human leaving
Earth
I’m guzzling beer
And rock a stare
Everywhere I look
Kilroy’s here
Written clear
Spitting in the
Code of the streets
They holding the heat
Like the sun
That’s looming in the sky
Old and unique
I speak the pitter-patter
Breath of the kids
And breath of the Wiz
(That’s how it is)
(How it is)

[Hook] x2

Joy, joy we got a lot
Best friends in a parking lot
I just want to feel better
I just want to feel right
I just want to feel better
I just want to feel right

I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
Give me the keys I want to drive
I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
If you give me the keys you know I won’t survive

Pour it down my throat
I need it just to cope
Hey kitty, kitty Say it ain't’ so
I’m drowning on tomorrow
Losing all my hope
Bottom of the well and I just lost the rope
I had a feeling this might not end so hot
So tell me tell me doctor you know how to make it stop
Give me all your medicine give me all your pills
Your bedside manner just to cure my ills

I’m a passenger I’m a passenger
Give me the keys I want to drive
I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
If you give me the keys you know I won’t survive

I’m a buffalo
I’m a lone ranger
I’m a squad car
I’m a, I’m your stranger
Teenage boys are sure to take a tumble
The reins, the reins
Are my lover

I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
Give me the keys I want to drive
I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
If you give me the keys you know I won’t survive

I will be wait, wait
I will be waiting for you
I will be wait, wait
I will be waiting for you

I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
Give me the keys I want to drive
I’m a passenger, I’m a passenger
If you give me the keys you know I won’t survive

call me ishmael, like my style
got a white whale in bulk mail
half a doubloon, one harpoon
price to sell, broken seashells
with purchase, free blowfish
old man queequeg, can’t sell his head
sell his head, head, sell head

lolita, light of my life
what’s your sign, mine’s the still life
scuse me miss, your pleasure is
on top of my to do list
i’m so sorry, it’s stupid
i think you stepped on my id
on my id, id, on my id

granted i am an inmate
of a mental hospital
and maybe i’m a bit shrill
but the cell wants free refills
two 60 watt bulbs birth me
hanging from the same old tree
same old tree, tree, same old tree
same old tree, tree, old oak tree

The first hippie on the moon
Timed his leap off the bauxite mining crane
Thinking that would skew the
Tune in his head so he floated to the plane
Heros give up zeros add up
And the margins crowd the page
God only knows how CEOs paid off my rage

The horizon here is curved like a pill
And it functions as the law
Cause beyond it lies the fire
In the sky glowing like the first hurrah
Heros give up zeros add up
And the margins crowd the page
God only knows how CEOs paid off my rage

The slime runs down the coast and covers everything in sight
The teaming hordes from invading lands choke the beach out with their deadly blight
They take root everywhere and won’t clear out until September
We need an inconvenient truth to make some genocidal weather

As the icecaps melt
Into the sea
It’s the end for you
More room for me

Killer waves and monster surf
Wipe out everybody on this Earth
Finally the beach is mine
Looks like it’s finally time for
Killer Waves

As Mother Nature plots her revenge I’ll be waiting on higher ground
Until a tsunami wipes out all the invader in my boardwalk town
So when the big one comes I’m afraid you won’t be missed
It’ll be just me and the sea and you’ll no longer exist

As the icecaps melt
Into the sea
It’s the end for you
More room for me

Killer waves and monster surf
Wipe out everybody on this Earth
Finally the beach is mine
Looks like it’s finally time for
Killer Waves

Killer waves will clean the slate
Killer waves – your only fate

We will destroy everything within your land
If your country is filled with caves and sand
Quietly wipe out your race
For just a chance to catch the ace
Even the slightest trace could come back and lay us to waste

We’re living in paranoid times (paranoid times)
An unmarked room for an unknown crime

Charges against you will never be made formal
There’s a blanket clause that allows
This sort of thing to be normal

We can torture and entrap
Everything perceived as a threat
A nation snugly kept in check
By unfit minds in a cold sweat

We’re living in paranoid times (paranoid times)
An unmarked room for an unknown crime

Paranoid Times!

Got a small infection
It's turning bright red
If it gets into my bloodstream
It'll go straight to my head
Can't stop itching
Can't stop scratching
It won't go away, Oh No

Got a massive infection
Climbing up to my knee
Too late to call the doctor
Better call the CDC
Can't stop itching
Can't stop scratching
It won't go away, Oh No

I'm a patient in an ER gown
Incapacitated, gagged and bound
Fighting a war that can't be won
As limb by limb I come undone
Results are in Prognosis: Negative

Got a nasty infection
It went straight to my bone
Now I'm an amputee
I can't put my pants on alone

One day there was a voice in your head
You screamed in terror when you heard what it said
No hell below, no paradise divine
We're all from dust and we're nothing when we die

It whispers in your ear every now and then
You try to shut it out, It's always chiming in
It's getting louder, harder to ignore
You can't pretend you dont hear it anymore

The other side of darkness - the one you truely fear
There's no one watching over all of us down here
The other side of darkness - the one that you can't face
It's the color of cold and endless space
The other side of darkness
The other side of darkness

So say your prayers if it'll ease the pain
Or make you think that this is not in vain
Just because you wish it so for you
Doesn't matter or make it true

You'll sleep as you did before
The eons of time before you were ever born
Oh what you'd give to have the Devil back
When the light stood for truth and the Evil was black

The other side of darkness - the one you truely fear
There's no one watching over all of us down here
The other side of darkness - the one that you can't face
It's the color of cold and endless space

No second chancess
No Final Reward
No higher purpose
Nothing for the other side of darkness
The other side of darkness
The other side of darkness
The other side of darkness
The other side

The midnight hour rolls around
And I catch the bus downtown
I crawl through the city streets
With all the twisted freaks

The room fills up so quick
With all the perverts and the lunatics
I crouch down low in my seat
And watch tonight's midnight movie

I want to see so much gore it makes me sick
I want to see death by a crucifix
I want to see a celluloid acid trip
At the midnight movies

You'll catch me down at Waverly
Seeing all the things I’m not supposed to see
I just keep focused on the screen
I get my fill from the projection machine

I want to see so much blood it makes me sick
I want to see divine eat some shit
I want to see the eraserhead baby hiss
At the midnight movies

I lead a lonely life of solitude and pain
Depression halting any chance of hope inside my brain
I fantasize what you despise
My heart is on my sleeve
I’m overdrawn my mind is gone
And i think we’d better leave

Bad bad bad bad biology
Its bad bad bad bad biology
And i don’t care who goes down with me
Its bad bad bad bad biology

I go to dives and take the lives
Of the ones that dare to touch me
An hours passed so soon at last
And I’ll shit this life inside me
Genetic freak a fucked up creep
(My goddamn way of life)
Well god himself chose me you see
So I’m going to fuck you until you die

Bad bad bad bad biology
Its bad bad bad bad biology
And i don’t care who goes down with me

I killed a dog today, oh boy
Mom and Dad will be so mad I know they're gonna beat me
It bit me harder than the rats
I pushed it all together, to make it stop the noises

They keep me chained up in this room
I got a bed with four cold walls of dirt all times around me
And I so hate it when it rains
You know it makes the ground get sick and then it turns so runny

Born of Man and Woman, I know I'm neither one
My skin so wet and sticky, I know that I’m their son
I'm chained up in this basement, a sideshow freak in prison
Born of Man and Woman

I think I made my Father mad
He used my chain to beat me, now I’m bleeding ugly green
I hear my mother scream to god:
""Oh God, Why did you do this? Why did you give me this monster?""

Born of Man and Woman, I know I'm neither one
My skin so wet and sticky, I know that I’m their son
I'm chained up in this basement, a sideshow freak in prison
Born of Man and Woman

You were always in my teenage dreams
I'd put my face up to the screen
I'd get so frustrated that I'd tear holes in my jeans
But you left it all a mystery

The years have passed and finally
Fell from the A-list down to D
You need a comeback, something no ones ever seen
Now there'll be no more mystery

You made a sex tape
And I feel sixteen again

65176,"

Don't wanna hear your predictions
'Cause I don't wanna know
2012? A billion years?
Maybe tomorrow?

Prophets of doom and scientists will hypothesise their dates
Cold facts or storybook tales
Will conclude their fate

When we finally reach oblivion
I just want to be oblivious
Bury my head deep in the sand
I just want to be oblivious
I don't matter how much time you spend
Narrowing down dates and time
The only certainty is the end

And I don’t need a final warning
What good would that do?
No prayers to be said, no rights to be read
No tears to be shed for you

When we finally reach oblivion
I just want to be oblivious
Bury my head deep in the sand
I just want to be oblivious
I don't matter how much time you spend
Narrowing down dates and time
The only certainty is the fucking end

And I just want to be oblivious

Musique pourrite compostée bin raide!

... calumet d’ailleurs il faut faire tourner !

[Eman]
Atic tac diggity wrap the fuck up
Deux feuilles de tabac deux grammes de bleu gras
À chaque cousin français qui s’pointe
Coup d’poing y avait jamais vu ça du weed de même
Deux puffs dégeule à terre un classique
Y d’vient blanc comme l’hiver y dit qui décolle a souère
Pendant c’temps là j’écris 45 barres, premier coup d’cymbale
Pif paf un aut’ blunt qui passe
Deux bières tapes les deux mains, passe le mic
J’ai assez d’textes pour rapper jusqu’à demain soir
J’te passe mon tape, tu comprends rien, tu connais rien
Christ de ciboire, c’est du rap c’pas du simili-porc
Ogden fuck avec un maudit post-rigodon, passe à coté
Lâche le citron, fais demi-ton
T’as pas à penser penser juste danser dans ces cas-là
Bouge un peu ton bassin Martin
On est pas faite en chocolat
Men ici Québec, Félix Leclerc, Jean Leloup, Ste-foy félicite King feat. Coeur de loup
Get the fuck out on est plastifié, blast le shit gun en plastique
Dans l’guichet Desjardins coin Cartier
Dopeness quasi-interdite, choke su’ l’spliff pendant qu’Ogden te décalisse
Lâche les mimiques, 20 secondes K.O. technique, pu d’barniques
Faudrait vraiment qu’on t’vende le kit, ha !

[Outro: KenLo]
Le roé c’est moé, né avec la couronne en-dssoure du nez
Fuck pas avec ça passque c’est sérieux jouer
Qu’essé qu’t’es si moé chu le roé
Le roé c’est moé

Nothin fancy
Nothin fit
Nothin wasted and no deal to make
What you need is what you want to take
And what you take you use
I'm just looking for that sweet spot
Where i can live the way that i want
Ill be waiting for you out front
If you want me too
Are you comin too
The fire is steady and the beat is strong
Give is good and wide and long
It don't even have to hold on
Cuz its got ahold of you
I'm just looking for that sweet spot
Where i can love the way that i want
Ill be waiting for you out front
If you want me too
Are you comin too
And when I find that sweet spot
Gonna give it everything i've got
Turn up the radio a whole lot
For the afternoon
Soft as a woman
Strong as a man
Throws yours head back in a full-mouth laugh
It's like knowing you can sleep at night
But you don't want to
I'm just looking for that sweet spot
Where I can love the way that i want
Ill be waiting for you out front
If you want me too
Are you comin too
Are you comin too

I'll tell you what I will miss –
California and horses
Down by the sailboats where we waded in
The feel of the world in my hands, in my hands
The feel of the world in my hands
And still so many ways that I love the wind –
From a storm in the sails to the breath on your lips
It's such a little thing, then again, then again
The feel of the world in your hands, in your hands
The feel of the world in your hands, in your hands
Just like the Sunday we drove out from Houston
Out to the edge of the world, out where the sky starts to bend
After awhile in the sun, you'll be sleeping, sleeping
I picture you now – you are beautiful, you are golden
Just like you were when you thought no one was looking
Time will take care of you, love. Time will take care of you, love
I will take care of you, love, again, again
The feel of the world in my hands, in my hands
The feel of the world in my hands, in my hands

"
65856,"

We used to sleep real late, play our records loud
Times we were broke, we'd laugh about it
Sometimes we'd just leave town, go down to the shore
Watch the waves close out, just to be close, just to be close
I don't want to fight anymore
About childish things we did before
I didn't mean what I said last night
I love you more than who is right and wrong
I want to stay and I made this song
Of all the reasons we don't have to fight

These words we shout, so who's to say
Where they will go when they fall away?
Maybe they hang around with lonely kids
With a balled up fist, saying ""you did this, you did this""
I don't want to fight anymore
About what we lost or things we swore
I didn't mean what I said last night
I love you more than who is right and wrong
I'm gonna stay and made this song
Of all the reasons we don't have to fight

The morning light goes red to gray
On what we've broken and thrown away
If I could, I just know how to walk away from my pride
Could you help me out? Can we put it back, put it back/
I don't want to fight anymore
I don't even know what it started for
I didn't mean what I said last night
I love you more than who is right and wrong
I stayed up late and I made this song
Of all the reasons we don't have to fight

This morning, if it all was gone, funny thing, it wouldn’t phase me none
Might feel like I just got home. See, I always had a taste for traveling alone
Only get this one time round, better speak up straight, better speak up proud
Good Lord, if he’s not at home, well, I always had a taste for traveling alone
Oh If I had a son, I would make him laugh, I would teach him something
I’d say, Son, you gotta hold your own, and it’s good to have a taste for traveling alone
Oh If I had a love, I would say, Man, got to keep up
Got to lay down, baby, feed my soul, ’cause you know I got a taste for traveling alone
Oh If I had a song, I would sing it now, wouldn’t take too long
I’d sing, Goodness is a real bare bone, and it’s what you do when you’re traveling alone
Down south, baby, in the heat, I was raised up right, I was raised so sweet
Sweetness ain’t gonna get you home. You’re bound to get a taste of traveling alone
I know that the world is mean, I know it don’t care, I been around, I seen it
It’s like a pretty girl who don’t even know. I guess everybody here is traveling alone
Cigarettes and a pick up truck, I’m gonna leave this town now, I got to press my luck
Ocean gonna break so slow. You know, I always had a taste for traveling alone

Skipped a stone and watched it go
The arc and then the undertoe
Thinking a day is something like a prayer

So much to ask you started soft
Then the wait of locks come off
In the end you just hope someone's there

CHORUS:
Cuz all these small talk relations
No they ain't nothin' for me
No nobody here knows the way that I feel

There's no one to answer to
Just the dark and me and you
All the angels standin' round just wishin'

For the drag there of your smoke
Taste of skin, scent of hope
Raise their skirts up when no words are rising

CHORUS
Small Talk relations
I can't hear one thing from you
Don't nobody here at all know the way that I feel

BRIDGE
Workmen in the street below
Softly play a radio
Hear my static through the traffic
Crowd just turns to leave
Secret current underneath
Cannot be heard above the racket

CHORUS

"
65859,"

I never thought I'd see eighteen
I finally got all eyes on me
My daddy made my sentencing
Now there's a first for everything
Don't ask me what comes after today
Don't ask me what comes after today
Sweet Emily's eyes are all I am thinking of
Don't ask me what comes after today

You must be proud your conscience is clean
I'm just what you'd expect I'd be
There's plenty bad to be said for me
But I never been your judge, I never been your judge
Don't ask me what comes after today
Don't ask me what comes after today
Sweet Emily's eyes are all I am thinking of
Don't ask me what comes after today

What's yours to take for free out round here
Is a bullet and a hundred years
But dream a dream might not be yours
Keep your head down, boy, keep your head down, boys
Don't ask me what comes after today
Don't ask me what comes after today
Sweet Emily's eyes are all I am thinking of
Don't ask me what comes after today

Nobody means for the gun to go off
Nobody wants it this way
Nobody sees how the deal went bad
But the ones living it every day

Up on 145th, you can see the bridge
But you can't cross the way
I been scared before, I've been scared before
No matter what you are, you get used to the chains
No matter what you are, you get used to the chains
Don't ask me what comes after today
Don't ask me what comes after today
Sweet Emily's eyes are all I am thinking of
Don't ask me what comes after today

The heart is an organ inside the chest that
Pumps out lots of blood
To the rest of the organs inside
So when my heart died
I cried cause my other organs didn't survive (Go!)

Being sad's cool 'cause it's so damn funny
If you don't have a car and you don't have money
Then your girls gonna go gonna find a new guy
Who can work nine to five who can really provide

(So,)
Bring on the heartbreak
Bring on the tummy-ache
Bring on the memories
Bring on insecurity
Let's go loneliness
Come on fragility
I love the feeling of the heartbreak killing me

Say Sayonara to your sense of security
Wave goodbye to a regular life
Reach with your hands and welcome the epitome
Of feeling like a nobody the rest of your life
Clap your fucking hands if you know that you're nothing now
Slit your wrists to the rhythm of this
Three big cheers to the tears that you're crying now
Being broken-hearted is an absolute bliss

Bring on the heartbreak
Bring on the tummy-ache
Bring on the memories
Bring on insecurity
Let's go loneliness
Come on fragility
I love the feeling of the heartbreak killing me

Silence ends, of a time, I be happy, special
I can feel you driving down, ... my expression
It’s obvious man, cause it makes your self conscious to say
That the knot in your face is a thing you ignore
That the knot in your face, is a thing you ignore

You don’t want to live a lie, I hold on to the day

Expressions were serial
I was taken
I needed a ride home, in the morning
But I don’t wanna sit or I might escape her gaze
I know it’s the distance, in the hallway
You’re looking for safety
I’m coming, stand by my left side
Oh, by my left side
Cause I know no harm will come to me on my left side
If the truth, I will hide in the bathroojm, till the morning
And I will look at the cartoon, on the ceiling
You are talking for loving, ...
But I see through you, I see through you
But I don’t wanna sit or I might escape her gaze

It's good to be alive
When night is here by 5
When the day begins so softly
And softly then it dies
When will this wind blow
No one will ever know

They tumble to and fro

I was looking up when someone said hello. It startled me, for I thought I was alone. My friends are devil-may-care kind of drifters. Me, I have a railroad. My loneliness was pure until someone noticed it. Life among senseless drifters could derail me

If you demand an explanation
I am here because I want to be
Not because my mother sent me
She told me, when I first left her heat
Bring a coat, it's cold
If you don't, I won't sleep
At first, I didn't believe
That the key to success in the world is to leave shelter
And that shelter is slavery
That comfort is the enemy
So I wanted to go to a party with you
Not because I like parties
I hate them, but I like you
There's no secret cloak
Nor a thick wooly coat
That can shield you from bad feelings
It's these truths that are hard telling
A wise man once told me
To be active in power is to be free
So why surrender one's autonomy
To spend a night with some lady?
I want someone to tell me
Before I hurt myself
That all living is hard living
As for all the love that's in my heart
And this is going to smart
I know getting, not giving
But if you want to talk about it, let's talk about it

Hey pumpkin patch, you know what I'm thinking? You're in charge when you think too much

I swear you'll never, ever forget me

See my scar, it goes from the side of my hip, all the way up to under my arm, I hope one day to be reconnected

Hey there honey, won't you see me bask?

Why do you care if I feel chicken-shit, leading each day without your companionship

I got laid, then I got a melody, it seems hot loving makes me write songs. When we walk, you're one step ahead of me. When I sing songs, I'm one step ahead of myself

Fuck that shit, I said I'm a vampire, raise your hands if you wanna dance, with the cute Aquarius not seeking a girlfriend

I need my, I need an apology, thirteen years of sucking a silver spoon, one girl should be insignificant

Now is the time for selling a difference, come on girls, get into my songs, I'm the last electro solo artist keeping their clothes on

I got laid, then I got a melody, it seems hot loving makes me write songs. When we walk, you're one step ahead of me. When I sing songs, I'm one step ahead of myself

You fuck yourself way too hard
You wouldn't be cool if it weren't for the lessons that you learned in Belgium

I feel courageous
I feel claustrophobic

To the land so low, I'm sloganeering
Playing Sega too, growing up like you

You're so backwards, I'm so forward
You buy buy buy into new trends
When I look inwards you look outwards
Mocking my lifestyle, fucking my friends
While I'm in bed the scum from the speakers slinks on out

Drink from the drip from the prick in the artery
Shoot to the stars with a league of chums
Sip from the stream, so sick of society
Postmodernism made punk rock everything

I feel better
I feel ballistic
I feel bourgeois and
I feel big

Dead DJs spin deathrock discs
A curse transmitted via 12""
Too few beats per minute, baby

Chin up, kids, they're making a killing
Dancing hard to horrible bands
Who play The Eagles while they are pilling
Doing coke, ignoring their fans
While I'm in bed with Siskel & Ebert
Two thumbs down

So call 411-CRITIQUE, it's your birthright

I bought a fake Kinkade
That's what the man said
But I wouldn't have known
For all my life
I thought I had it made
But I was betrayed
By a forger in a foreign country
I don't like
I seen this world without disruption
Everything so peaceable and bright
And all my true antipathies
Were vanquished
By the light
I bought a fake Kinkade
That's what the man said
But I wouldn't have known
For all my life
I had it laid
In a safe place
Had it in a gilt frame
I know my rights
I walk the cobblestones in starlight
I feel the moisture on my skin
I feel the power of imagination
Move ordinary men
But it was a fake

Sing the anthem
A song of the dead
Sing the love song
That rots in your head
Find the answer
Don't ever look back
There's blood to splatter
And skulls to crack

Sing the anthem
Of the underworld
Sing the love song
For the ugly girls
Pray you'll always
Be a fucked up kid
So pledge allegiance
To the blood and shit

I do the creepy crawl
Crazy legs like daddy long

Because I keep on, keep on movin'
Don't stop, there's nothing to it
Keep on, keep on movin'
Don't stop, there's nothing to it

You do the Frankenstein
That's why you look so fine
I do the Spanish fly
That's how I make you mine

I let my guitar drool
That's how we stay so cool
Her name is jazijoo
And together we're the perfect two

I sing a magic song
That's how I do no wrong
I'm like a nuclear bomb
And pretty soon you'll all be gone

I was lost in space like an alien race
Just going by the light of the moon
A bed-headed musician on a dead-end mission
I had no idea what I was supposed to do
But I was feeling like heaven at the 711
I was burning like a blown out tyre
Me and Tavi going down as we were hanging on the same old wire

(Bridge)
So we jumped into the fires

(Chorus)
Wild desire
Wild desire

(Verse 2)
I was looking for trouble like a lion in a jungle
Yeah they call me the infinite kid
I was blowing out my brains like a speeding steel train
And waving like a flag in the wind
Another hungry motherfucker another filthy bloodsucker
I was thirsty like a wild vampire
So I traded my crown as the king of my local empire

(Bridge)

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 3)
Oh we were living in a prison of our own ambition
Well we must have been high from the fumes
'Cause we were yelling and screaming like some schizoid demons
Throwing punches in the pitch black room
So we made our escape swinging poisonous snakes
Getting cut up on the razor wire
But we didn't give a fuck 'cause we were so fucked up and tired

(Bridge)

(Chorus x2)

Hello sweetheart you know I love the way that you talk
Hello sweetheart I got too much love in my heart
I got the telephone in my eyes
I got your number memorized
Connection, connection
You know you give me sweet feelings in my ears
You know you give me sweet smiles instead of tears
I got the telephone in my eyes
I got your number memorized
Connection, connection
So come on and take me now with your fingers touching mine
Come on and take me now well i'm hanging on the line
I got the telephone in my eyes
I got your number memorized

Shooting the circles of sound
When I'm looking in the mirror
A creature so ugly and wild

Cause I'm a bad, bad thing

Got out of a dream today
In the graveyard where I do my dreamin'
Tied my hair in braids
Yeah the colored pinwheels spinnin'
Smoking pipe
Thought I'd get away
But I can't go anywhere without my sun medallion
So I got into my car this morning
On the street where I do my livin'
She's a mean green chevrolet
Yeah I felt the engine turnin
Black coffee
Standard transmission
You know I can't go anywhere without my sun medallion
Somebody said to me
You know you got to take'er easy
So show me a path to the mountains
And color the sky with green leaves
You know you got to do the dance
Let go of your body
Honey I'm telling you now
I love you

See all the kids jump-jumpin' in line

Everybody's givin' everybody hugs
I'm in the shadows, I'm on the outside
And I walk these streets in the middle of the night
Walk these streets in the middle of the night
Walk these streets in the middle of the night

And everywhere I go, I am a stranger
There's nothing I know, I am a stranger
And everywhere I go, I am a stranger
I am a stranger

And all I do is bark...

Everybody messed up on some drugs
I'm in the basement, livin' with the bugs
I'm in the attic with no lights
And I walk these streets in the middle of the night
Walk these streets in the middle of the night
Walk these streets in the middle of the night

And everywhere I go, I am a stranger
There's nothing I know, I am a stranger
And everywhere I go, I am a stranger

Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
He plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He's a pin ball wizard
There has got to be a twist
A pin ball wizard
S'got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?'

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay
'N' never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball

I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pin ball crown to him

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kind
Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!

Me dê um copo de veneno, pelo menos
Pra eu morrer
Por não gostar de viver
E nem de ter medo de morrer

Não tenho medo
Não tenho medo de morrer
Pelos mesmos venenos

Por favor me dê um copo de veneno
Pelo menos
Com duas pedrinhas de gelo
Pelo meio

Pra diluir
O gosto amargo do veneno supremo
De ter que viver sofrendo
Por mim
Ou por você

Me dê um copo de veneno, pelo menos
Pra eu morrer
Por não gostar de viver
E nem de ter medo de morrer

Não tenho medo
Não tenho medo de morrer
Pelos mesmos venenos

Por favor me dê um copo de veneno
Pelo meio
Pra não morrer de vez
E esperar
Esperar

[Verso 1]
Quando os urubus voam baixo
É sinal que o próximo passo
Vem do desejo
De querer devorar
Escraviza o movimento
Faz do lobo o seu rebento
Quem vier bater vai cansar

[Pré-refrão]
Gatas como essa já vi muitas por aí
Mas com ela é diferente
E eu quero repetir
Que o seu cabelo é longo
Mas não é liso
Que o seu sorriso é raro
Mas vem com tudo
Tem um olhar que prende
E tem um jeito
Menina com traços de preto

[Refrão]
Me dá sua mão
Vamo andar pela cidade

[Verso 2]
Traz à mão sempre um torpedo
Disparado com efeito
De folha seca
Pra guardar na gaveta
Sua agenda super lotada
Dispensa drogas, não fuma nada
Estendi
A minha madrugada

[Pré-refrão]
Gatas como essa já vi muitas por aí
Mas com ela é diferente
E eu quero repetir
Que o seu cabelo é longo
Mas não é liso
Que o seu sorriso é raro
Mas vem com tudo
Tem um olhar que prende
E tem um jeito
Menina com traços de preto

[Refrão]
Me dá sua mão
Vamo andar pela cidade

How about energy?
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Give her another time
No relation, no relation
Search mountains when I sleep
In the air but, in the air but

(Chorus)
Soon you’ve gotta do something sad, ad
You, you gotta do something

(Verse)
Go to better times
Make her happy, make her happy
Moonstruck energy
Don’t rehearse it, don’t rehearse it
Next drop that I see
Make the offer, make the offer

(Chorus)
Soon you’ve gotta do something sad, ad
You, you gotta do something

Vai tempo gira ao seu redor
Seja como for

They say that age kills the fire inside of a man
That he hears death coming
He opens the door and says, ""Come in!""
He is fearless
That is a bag of lies!
I've got enough fight in me to devour the world!
So I fight

Holding hands at midnight
Beneath the starry sky
Its nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Holding hands at midnight
Beneath the starry sky
Its nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Love the one who loves you
Beneath the starry sky
Its nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Holding hands at midnight
Beneath the starry sky
Its nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Love the one who loves you
Beneath the starry sky
Its nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Holding hands at midnight

And you can get it if you try
Holding hands at midnight

Black horses riding in the dead of the night
I can see them loose horsemen entering you
I can hear them screaming, calling out my name
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out you too

Black horses ride in the dead of the night
I can see the patterns putting the inner work out
And when they hear them screaming back, hear the pain
When you hear them screams, it's calling out you too

Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride

Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride

Let us stay somewhere away from you
When you hear screaming, it's calling out today
Instead you still are sorry, away from you
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out you too

Black horses riding in the dead of the night
I can see them loose horsemen entering you
I can hear them screaming, calling out my name
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out you too

Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride

Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride

Let us stay somewhere away from you
When you hear screaming, it's calling out today
Instead you still are sorry, when we are away from you
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out you too

Would you, would you
Live down in the murky ground
Turning the fishy deep
Where it’s dark and gloom
Feels and fens growing in my skin
I want a pond to rot in
No lake, no sound
Not any of ...sitting around
Everything is dreamed in
That’s not the body that I came in
Feels and fens growing in my skin
I want a pond to rot in

This is my town this is hazardville, just look around it's one big sleeping pill

And it's not perfect, I got the brains to know
It's not perfect, I got the guts to say it's so
It's not perfect, I got the brains to know

I know you, I don't like what you do, you know me, I'm what you wanna be

And it's not perfect, I got the brains to know
You're not perfect, I got the guts to tell you so
I'm not perfect I got the brains to know

68708,"

Don't wanna grow up but I'm expected to
And i'm expected to wanna grow up

Hey why you wanna get in my way
What makes you think that's okay?
I always mean what I say
And I wanna say ""you suck""

It's too much, I'm gonna blow
I wanna be a kid, don't make me grow

"
68709,"

I find it funny
That we were friends
Cause you're a shithead
In the end

I was like you
Now I'm not
Then you left us
Let your brain rot

You're a shithead
And you're gone
You're a shithead
And you're gone
You're possessed by a dick, and your mind's in a ditch
I see that you're bewitched
Thank God you're gone

I'm really sorry
I did you wrong
But you're a shithead
All along

You say you're with us
Not at all
Did you say it
You make my skin crawl

You're a shithead
And you're gone
You're a shithead
And you're gone
You're possessed by a dick, and your mind's in a ditch
I see that you're bewitched
Thank God you're gone

You gotta learn
That one will always turn
And if you're there
No one will care

You're a shithead
And you're gone
You're a shithead
And you're gone
You're possessed by a dick, and your mind's in a ditch
I see that you're bewitched
I wish you weren't gone

Caught me swimming in the sugar bowl
Feed my body but I'm never full
Bless the trashcan inside my soul
So I learn to take the horns by the bull

Light you're killing me
Right I gotta be
Night inside of me
Life on my tv

We drip dry, we get by

"
68711,"

Why you gotta do that stuff?
Don't you think it's bad enough?

Me and you, oh what to do
Me and you ain't got a clue
Me and you, we're fucking through
Me and you, our brains is goo

"
68712,"

Let me outside and into the yard
Leave me in the back of your car

I'm just a lonely girl, life without disruption
I'm just a lonely girl, fiery eruption
I'm just a lonely girl, pet my head
I'm just a lonely girl

Go to work and leave me at home
Give me water and throw me a bone

"
68713,"

My mouth hurts
From fits and swears
But what's worse is
I don't care

What happened to you
To make me wear black and studs?
What happened to me
To wear them just because?

What happened to you
To make me wear black and studs?
What happened to me
To wear them just because?

My eyes hurt
From drinking
But what's worse is
It's no help

What happened to you
To make me wear black and studs?
What happened to me
To wear them just because?

What happened to you
To make me wear black and studs?
What happened to me
To wear them just because?

Misconception
You thought you were first
There's repetition
Because our minds are cursed

Misconception
You thought you were first
There's repetition
Because our minds are cursed

What happened to you
To make me wear black and studs?
What happened to me
To wear them just because?

[Intro Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1 Eminem]
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for Delph like Philly
I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
I apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating, and
I'm debating on leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see I'm grieving, I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help
I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin my reflection, I walk around the house trying to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her
Shit

[Hook Danny Boone and Ozzy Osbourne]
And I..
I'm going through changes
And I...
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2 Brooks Buford]
And breathing's overrated, storm chasing and it's getting later
I used to love her now I hate her, she's a brain raider
Falling in a crater, of lost memories
I'm so out of hand I don't even fuck with me
I'm goin' trippin', drunk and slippin', sleepin' and bitching
Switchin' prescriptions, bangin' a random whore and itchin'
I don't give a flyin' feces, I ain't one with the human species
Slappin' the nurse, tryin' to up my C-C's
I fall apart, take all my pain, turn it to art
Blowin' up a K-Mart and blame it all on Mozart
Fuck I'm surprised I got a deal, every two hours I take a pill
That's where I'm at, it's all surreal
I got imaginary friends, an imaginary life
An imaginary wife and a real knife
Out of here by next weekend
Hung over on the dresser with my brain leakin'

[Hook Danny Boone and Ozzy Osbourne]
And I..
I'm going through changes
And I...
I'm going through changes

[Verse 3 Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you, you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
""Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it""
Fucking drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gonna do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then:

[Hook 2 Danny Boone ,Ozzy Osbourne and Eminem]
And I..
I'm going through changes
And I...Don't know what I'm going through
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 4 Danny Boone]
I'm whacked out, on jack and blacked out
Trapped in a crackhour full of d-d-d-d-d-doubt
I got guilt to the hilt, I fight tears and fears
Been out for ten years, hit a big bump off the mirror
Find me at www dot I came to trouble you dot
Com here motherfucker, take your best shot
I'm suicidal, got a lot of demons to fight, I'll
Probably sit in a chair and put my mouth around a rifle
I feel abused the loser blues are my booze, I'm in the who's who's
Of dope fiends and floozies in the land ff beer cans and uzis
Beggers are never choosy
The morning sun is like a sledgehammer to the forehead
[Brooks Buford]
And I'm barely here look in the mirror everyday and slowly disappear
Been through a million and 67 emotions in my short career
Riddle by fear staggered down the street, fall off a pier
Awe, FUCK IT!!

[Hook Danny Boone and Ozzy Osbourne]
And I...
I'm going through changes
And I...
I'm going through changes

[Verse 5 Eminem]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame starting to give me an excuse, to be at an all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin right
I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out
""(Daddy), don't you die on me, (Daddy), better hold your ground""
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

[Hook 3 Danny Boone ,Ozzy Osbourne, Eminem and Hailie]
And I..(Daddy)
I'm going through changes (Daddy)
And I...Don't know what I'm going through
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 6 Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back I'mma be bulletproof
I'mma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains guess it pours, yes it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows there never been a saint
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm

[Hook 2 Danny Boone ,Ozzy Osbourne and Eminem]
And I..
I'm going through changes
And I...Don't know what I'm going through
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 7 Cee-Lo]
My heartbeat is racin'
Even though I'm standin' still I can't stop storm chasin'
A soul that shell casin'
So close to overdose the light of day hurts my eyes
Wishin' my death could be a surprise
My life should be more than four walls and the floor
But that's all that is mine, God, give me a sign
Cause I'm tryin' and dyin' at the same time
I'm not hesitatin', I'm waitin'

[Bridge Danny Boone]
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery

[Hook Danny Boone and Ozzy Osbourne]
And I...
I'm going through changes
And I...
I'm going through changes

[Outro Danny Boone]
And I run away
From the day
And I am not okay
My soul's a misery

Taking two hearts and puttin' 'em together
Maybe you think you're a wise guy

Maybe she broke your heart
I know she did
Now you've been played for a fool, boy, hey

She is just too much
And he ain't got enough
Oh no

I am the anti-psychotic
I've tried a range of hypnotics
I am the perfect advert for living impaired
I'm trapped in a world inside
Nowhere to run or to hide
I've tried the leading brands
But I don't get nowhere

But a psychotic episode
And I can't go out today
Baby's had a psychotic episode
And I'm not feeling good

Psychotic episode, doctor
How long will I stay
Baby's had a psychotic episode
And I'm not feeling good

I went to see my doctor
Felt like a helicopter
He told me ""Shogun, I think the symptoms will get worse""
I took the pills like he said
Now whenever I try and use my head
I'm feeling all the pain in the universe

In a psychotic episode
I don't wanna play baby
And a psychotic episode
And I'm not feeling good

Psychotic episode
How long will I stay
Baby's in a psychotic episode
And I'm not feeling good

Well I'm number five
And she's number nine
Walking down the lane
Where I live

When I'm number one
I'm gonna have my fun
But til then she's got to give
And I hardly know sometimes if she sees me
As I fall
Give me just one more chance
I'll be beating down her door

Well, I've been alone
And I'll take you home
But my bedroom smells like cum
I could take you out
It would be my shout
But you'll find that I'm no fun

And I hardly know sometimes
But I wonder ""Is it love?""
Give me just one more chance
I need her
I need her

Love, love, love, love
Try to be her 'steady'
But I don't think she's ready enough
And I hurt myself for reasons
I can't explain
And I've watched her changing seasons
Down the lane
Down the lane
Down the lane
Down the lane
Down the lane

I know that you don't want me, baby
I don't care

Just wanted her name

A dreamer
Who's forgotten how to dream
A singer
When nobody's listening
You're an optimist
You think that everything works out
You're a rising sun
Setting fire to the clouds
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
Baby, you don't have to be a star
I will hear your voice in three part harmony
When I'm alone driving in my car
I was alright
Until you came along
To breath new life
Into my tired songs
When you sing to me wind rushes through the trees
When you sing to me waves crash on the beach
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
Baby, you don't have to be a star
I will hear your voice in three part harmony
When I'm alone driving in my car
A dreamer
The kind that I've been searching for
A dreamer
That left me wanting more
Ahhhh...
You will be the soundtrack of my summer
Baby, you don't have to be a star

The work begins with the setting of the sun
They advise me how to play, how to look that way
See life goes on and on and on and on, on, on

And above the skin where the beauty gets old
All advise me how to play, how to look that way
See life goes on and on and on and on, on, on

Oh, who was one second of love?
One second of love, one second of love
Oh, who was one second of love?
One second of love, one second of love

Time is moving times get rough
You advise me how to play, when I'm with you

Refrão:
Frustre-se, ouça-me
Mova-se, foda-se
Pensa que sucumbi? (Engano seu!)

Primeira vez que colei numa batalha de free
Eu me lembro das risadas, até consigo ouvir
Só que as bocas irônicas, de risada incrédula
No fim da noite me pagaram cédula por cédula
Deixo caras putos por não ser periférico
Mas tremem feito acrofóbicos no teleférico
Guilhotina microfônica, flow no groove
Só faltaram me dar o rabo lá na Casa Muv
Mais de vinte batalhas filmadas pela trupe
Nenhuma delas nunca foi postada no Youtube
Sei lá que porra vocês fazem mocando meus vídeos
Devem se masturbar gozando com meus homicídios

Refrão:
Frustre-se, ouça-me
Mova-se, foda-se
Pensa que sucumbi? (Engano seu!)

Um fabricante de adaga no estúdio
Retalho MC’s tipo Eliza Samúdio
Chama a Interpol, Scotland Yard
Minha cidade é quente, por isso meu rap arde
Tipo querosene derramado em rabo assado
Meu sobrenome é Castro, por isso serão castrados
Quebro decibéis, paradigmas e regras
Velho, no sapato dessas putas sou uma pedra (vai!)

Refrão:
Frustre-se, ouça-me
Mova-se, foda-se
Pensa que sucumbi? (Engano seu!)

Sinceridade macro, ódio veio de lambuja
Agora saca porque sou tão boca suja
Acupuntura com punhais, foi, rapaz
2012 o ano das punhaladas por trás
Papai do céu, cê viu? Fala pra mim! Cê viu?
A cada vez que me fudi, um demônio sorriu!
Permita que essa porra penetre nos seus ouvidos
Eu tô cuspindo lava, abraço aos envolvidos

Refrão:
Frustre-se, ouça-me
Mova-se, foda-se
Pensa que sucumbi? (Engano seu!)

The way you walk has got me turning around
I like your style
And when you're talking I can hear every sound
'Cause you drive me wild
I sit and wonder what you're thinking about
I'd love to know
Hold up [for longer] just a little while
We'll walk together and I really wanna tell you that

I just wanna be with you, you should know
I just wanna be with you, you should know

We are alive when we're [going] alone
So let's not pretend
You can tell me whatever you want
Just remember we're friends
Wanna call you every day on the phone
Just to hear you talk
Hold up [for longer] just a little while
We'll walk together and I really wanna tell you

I just wanna be with you, you should know
I just wanna be with you, you should know
I just wanna be with you, I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be, I just wanna be with you

You always say you don't want to see the end
You never stop, you just rock around again
It's all fits and nothing but starts
You were born to break all their hearts
People come and go, but there's nothing like you, Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne
Ooh, when you rock it Roxanne
Ooh, when you rock it Roxanne
Ooh, when you rock it Roxanne

You got the look and you got the attitude
And when you rock it, it always gets me in the mood
It's all fits and nothing but starts
You were born to break all their hearts
People come and go, but there's nothing like you, Roxanne

You tell me I’m the one I’m the only one
Why have you got to be like that?
Another time promise, I’m down on my luck
Can it really be that bad?
Give me doubt do it, you do not want
Why have you got to be like that?
You tell me I’m the one I’m the only one
Why have you got to be like that?
All night long
We wanna party
All night long

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Concrete turns to gold and white
Toffee airplanes taking flight
Licorice branches shade your eyes
Not just blue, but rainbow skies

Snowflakes fall like powdered sugar
Swedish fish swim in the river

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

Candy bar skyscrapers tower above
Pink and yellow peeps fly like doves
Gummy bears just walk the streets
You never know who they might greet

Marshmallow taxis drive on ground
Bubblegum balloons just float around

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

Clouds made of sugar daddies, rain caramel drops
This Candy City never stops
Except when you become awake
Awaiting your lovely lunch break

You're just an average human being
Not doing anything to benefit humanity

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

[Verso 1]
Coloriste a paisagem destes olhos deficientes
Construiste uma miragem com esses tijolos transparentes
Viste mais longe quando eu preciso de lentes
Foste precisa nos momentos em que era indeciso e tu não mentes
Quando dizes que 'tás a postos (Eu vi)
Beijaste-me e não tiraste os óculos (Eu senti)
Que aceitaste mais rápido a minha pessoa do que eu próprio (Então sorri)
Porque és o antónimo do ódio que eu guardo dentro de mim
Sei que é parvo ser assim
E eu estou farto de ser assim
Mas não saio desta casa onde cresci, onde nasci
Por favor, parte uma parte e leva-a sem receio
Prefiro ficar só e a metade, porque nunca me vou dar por inteiro
Ying e yang, eu vejo a preto e branco
Tinhas um jardim, puseste lá um banco
Disseste p'ra me sentar um instante
Encostaste-te ao meu ombro, eu fiquei imóvel e distante
Escrevi um poema sem pés nem cabeça e tive vergonha de o mostrar
P'ra este tema tinha versos na cabeça, mas não os vou cantar
Deita ao rio este copo meio vazio
Porque enchê-lo é um desperdício
E duvido que nenhum de nós se vai rachar
Isto vai dar em triângulo e não é equilátero
Entre tu, eu, e o meu lado macabro
Esse espaço onde me afundo
Profundo, obscuro e vago
Mas lá no fundo assumo que te espero no fundo do lago

[Refrão]
Yo! Chamo-te, vem ter comigo
A este sítio inalcançável
Não é nada aconselhável
Gritei sem voz e tu ouviste...
Não sei como fizeste
Mas a minha máscara derrete e eu fico livre
Mas é tão complicado lidar com a simplicidade
De dar e receber sentimentos de verdade
Esta troca não será equivalente
Mas espero aqui pelo momento
Em que possa compensar-te

[Verso 2]
Olha-me com aqueles olhos que prevêem desgraças
Não aches assim tanta graça a essas piadas forçadas
Pára!, porque eu não tenho troco p'ra isto
Repara: vou ter de dar o dobro p'ra isso
Mas eu passo a vida com a ressaca e sem recobro previsto
Meti-me nisto, agora sou o quisto que mina a relação
Eu se conseguisse dava-te a perfeição
Mas a minha génese é ténue
Sou inconstante, é uma constatação
Não é défice de auto-confiança, é excesso de auto-conhecimento
Mas eu preciso de ti, como um moinho do vento
Mas nunca vi um moinho a prestar agradecimentos
E a maioria estão abandonados
Apesar de rodarem eternamente
Eu sou assim: estúpido
Falo demais e passo pouco tempo lúcido
Frases banais não fazem de mim um rústico
Mas eu digo que não és tu, sou eu
Isto já não é cliché, isto é abuso

[Refrão]
Yo! Chamo-te, vem ter comigo
A este sítio inalcançável
Não é nada aconselhável
Gritei sem voz e tu ouviste...
Não sei como fizeste
Mas a minha máscara derrete e eu fico livre
Mas é tão complicado lidar com a simplicidade
De dar e receber sentimentos de verdade
Esta troca não será equivalente
Mas espero aqui pelo momento
Em que possa compensar-te

[Verso 3]
Não mereço este conforto e mereço ser confrontado
Mas adoro o conforto
Vem ver a paisagem deste lado
Não digas que queres saber no que é que eu estou a pensar
Não precisas de saber para me perceberes
Eu preciso de esconder para te amar
Engana-te p'ra teu bem
Engano-me p'ra meu bem
Diz que isto correu bem, diz que isto não morreu
Vem! ver com o que se parecem as nuvens deste lado
Vem correr neste prado
Que é meu lado bonito
Não ligues se em vez de calmo, 'tiver demasiado parado
Se tiver ignorado, é puro mal-entendido
Entre a minha mente e o meu corpo
Como se fosse fogo amigo
Insulto, magoo-te, respondo, grita comigo
Absolve o meu inimigo
Estou quase a ser absorvido
Quero dar-te o meu sorriso
Enorme, mas conclusivo
Está quase construído, está quase concluído...
Vou caprichar para te dar
O meu melhor sorriso

Pambaram, pambaram...

É domingo, e eu sei como é
Uma coisa é acordar, outra é por-me de pé
Há algumas tonturas e um certo mal-estar
Por mais vezes que aconteça
Não me consigo habituar
Eu sei que podia beber sumo
Mas já devia ser imune ao impulso de vomitar
""P'á próxima, bebo sumo""
Os remorsos num segundo
Só há um rumo: o duche que me vai ressuscitar
Deito-me a horas de acordar
Almoço às horas do lanche
Comer restos garante que não sou importante
Mas mesmo que tivesse um grande papel na música
Este filetes iam saber a papel de música
Vou dormir uma sesta
Só mais uns segundos de sono para a estatística
Não penso em mais nada
E logo só espero que ganhe o meu Benfica

Domingo santo, estou em modo letargia
Esta data foi riscada, o fim-de-semana tem um dia
É o Domingo santo, estou em modo poupança:
Não gasto recursos, porque hoje o tempo não avança
É o Domingo santo, quase que parece que morro
Ora deitado, ora estendido - alguém me traga o soro!
Domingo santo, mas isto até é fixe
E apesar de me sentir mal, até me sinto feliz

Acordo a escorrer ideias vazias
Será que ao domingo também existe vida antes do meio-dia?
O meu sentido de humor atinge um píncaro
Se estas piadas são secas, devias de ver como eu me sinto
Não sei como mas dou por mim no café
Estou à nora
Estou de pé
Isto demora? é um café e uma cola
Estás melhor? Pergunta o empregado
Eu ontem nem vim aqui, mas claro que já estou marcado
É chato quando o teu domingo está rotulado
Podia alegar que não, mas o meu aspecto diz a verdade
É chato, mas não me apetece 'tar chateado
Dou-lhe um sorriso e faço um ar despreocupado
Toldado [?], entrego, o meu crânio é feito de ar
'Tá a dar o Mika, por que é que eu 'tou a cantarolar?
Alguém liga, 'tou sem pica
Ao domingo não se complica
E hoje só quero ver o meu Benfica ganhar

Mais uma água, mais uma café
Mais uma água, mais uma cola
Hoje nem toco no tabaco
Quem me dera ir ao McDonald's...
Mais uma água, mais uma café
Mais uma água, mais uma cola
Acho que vou comprar tabaco
Apanhar ar lá para fora...
Mais uma água, mais uma café
Mais uma água, mais uma cola
Dar uns bafos para ver se isto melhora...
Mais uma água, mais uma café
Mais uma água, mais uma cola
Eu até comprava tabaco, mas vai começar a bola...
Mais uma água, mais uma café
Mais uma água, mais uma cola
Já é intervalo, já foi meio maço e eu 'tou farto de coca-cola
Mais uma água, mais uma café
Mais uma água, mais uma cola
'Tá quase a acabar e, para dar sorte, venha lá uma jola

Domingo santo, estou em modo letargia
Esta data foi riscada, o fim-de-semana tem um dia
É o Domingo santo, estou em modo poupança:
Não gasto recursos, porque hoje o tempo não avança
É o Domingo santo, quase que parece que morro
Ora deitado, ora estendido - alguém me traga o soro!
Domingo santo, mas isto até é fixe
E apesar de me sentir mal, até me sinto feliz

Yeah...
AHYA (AHYA) (x3)
AHYA!

[Verse 1: Dengaz]
Tudo o que eu queria era isto
Acreditei mais nisto do que em Cristo
Sem pressa mas com força, em cada episódio
Nunca fui com ganância ao pódio, então não entendo o ódio
Vivia sem saber se ela ficava cá
Rimava 24 só pa não lembrar
Que eu não queria que ela virasse uma estrela, ela afastou-se
Tipo que assim eu me habituava a ficar sem ela
Guerreira como não há ninguém (não há ninguém)
Que tenha a força que ela tem (que ela tem)
Se for preciso, dá tudo e fica sem
Mas com força igual à dela ainda tá pa vir alguém, damn
Tão não digas que eu não sei nada
Não devo nada a ninguém, não vos conheço não me digam nada
Verdadeiro, faço isto por amor
Yes I do it from the heart enquanto der fazer canções de amor
E sou só eu, sem bullshit, sem fake friends, sem wrapped shit
E os mesmos que me vêem por perto
São os mesmos que lá estavam desde as primeiras rimas no gueto
Que disseram q'eu tinha qualquer coisa
Que um dia chegava lá e partia a loiça
Que ser real e verdadeiro não é a mesma coisa, pa esperar
Que a poeira cega os homens, mas também poisa
And I don't like that
Se não sou prá AHYA family, então tou-me a cagar pró rap
Agradeço o love, dizem que eu tou perto
Mas por dentro ainda tou com medo, e quem tem medo é esperto
E o que é que me interessa esse skill?
Aqui o skill tava em aspas, o que me interessa é esse people
E achas que eu não faço disto vida
Enquanto eu escrevo e gravo não a vejo com a minha filha na barriga
E dentro e fora da cabine
Eles sabem q'eu só represento a luta do meu team
E não não tou sozinho, if you know what I mean
É perigoso ser humilde, ser bom é crime
E às vezes já nem sei o que faço aqui
Depois entendo que é porque eu sou assim
Original, só por ser quem sou you feel me?
Sejam bem-vindos, AHYA family

A verdade é que eu não paro e não desisto boy
Desde puto que andei à procura disto boy
Cada queda é um novo erguer mas não fico triste
Recompenso e ponho amor em tudo o que eu conquisto boy
Sei que vou ter tudo o que eu sempre quis I know
'Tava sem foco vocês chamaram agora eu vou
Ser a imagem do meu sonho, já sou
Quem deixou tudo para trás no chão? Quem oh?
Querem-me dizer que eu não sou capaz
Mas eu não como aquilo
Qualquer coisa que não me queira aqui mano eu aniquilo
Neva neva give in Churchill
A vossa força e o vosso amor, meu skill
Sem medo nem vergonha de falhar sou chato
Para caraças e eu não parei de tentar
E eu já vos tinha dito que eu consigo
Quem nunca desiste nunca pode ser vencido

Eles disseram que eu não tinha tempo but
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up up
Na na neva give up up
Na na neva give up
Eu tou vivo e tou pa provar que eu existo
E venha o que vier não vale a pena eu não desisto so
Quem acredita sabe neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára hands up
Na na neva give up
Na na neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up
Na na neva give up
Na na neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up

Caí quando pensei que estava tudo bem
Levantei-me cuspi o sangue e não culpei ninguém
Ninguém me pára, mas só não parem de me testar
Não inventem mais que o meu sucesso para me detestar
Se é aquilo que tu queres, get it
Ninguém quer que tu lá chegues, fuck it
E se tens tudo o que é preciso, keep it
Vou 'tar no topo deste game, Richie
Nunca deixes que ninguém te diga que nunca vai dar certo
Nunca deixes que ninguém te pare porque não estavas perto
Vais falhar só não podes é desistir
A tua parte ainda está pra vir e tu caiste
Só porque não estavas perto
Tou sem força mas não vês, se caio nove vezes
Levanto-me dez e então...
Não sabias quem eu era, não desisto do meu sonho
Não paro até não esquecer

Eles disseram que eu não tinha tempo but
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up up
Na na neva give up up
Na na neva give up
Eu tou vivo e tou pa provar que eu existo
E venha o que vier não vale a pena eu não desisto so
Quem acredita sabe neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára hands up
Na na neva give up
Na na neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up
Na na neva give up
Na na neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up

(Na na neva give up
So I neva give up)

Aqui tou eu a motivar com palavras
Quem achava impossível e quem não acreditava
No meu valor e empenho
Hoje em dia metade do que eu sonhei já tenho

Eles disseram que eu não tinha tempo but
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up up
Na na neva give up up
Na na neva give up
Eu tou vivo e tou pa provar que eu existo
E venha o que vier não vale a pena eu não desisto so
Quem acredita sabe neva give up
Quem acredita nunca para hands up
Na na neva give up
Na na neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up
Na na neva give up
Na na neva give up
Quem acredita nunca pára so i neva give up

Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que igual a mim não há
Que eu não falho, que eu não traio e que eu vou estar cá
Que é só ela que eu vejo, só ela que eu beijo
E que mesmo que eu quisesse nem tinha jeito
Que era mais que o meu feitiço, é tudo o que eu conquisto
Não dou trela a mais ninguém, nem gosto disso
Que eu sei que vou estar cá para sempre
Que tu sabes que eu sou diferente
E que eu vou contar a nossa história a toda a gente
Ela disse que queria tudo, eu disse que não tinha nada
Ela disse que queria o mundo, ninguém disse que eu não deixava
Ela disse que me quer aqui, mas eu disse que tinha que ir
Vou ter que deixá-la sem olhar para trás para poder vê-la sorrir
Eu sei que é foda agora acreditares em mim
Mas eu vivo num planeta que não é lugar pra ti, baby
Não pedes nada demais, eu sei
But I’m sorry, for real, I love you, mas fica bem

[Refrão]
Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que eu não me vou embora
Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que já está na hora
Ela só quer que eu lhe mostre que mais nada importa
Mas tudo o que ela quer, para mim, agora, é foda
Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que eu não me vou embora
Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que já está na hora
Ela só quer que eu lhe mostre que mais nada importa
Mas tudo o que ela quer, para mim, agora, é foda

[Dengaz]
E ela quer um amor igual ao dos filmes
Mas eu estou com tantos tensos que isso devia ser crime
Estou com ela e estou na boa, se não estou, estou com outra
Vadias tem manha toda e nenhuma abre a boca
E o meu mal é não me virares as costas
E o teu mal é eu saber que tu gostas
E não tem mal para mim, mas sei que te importas
E enquanto eu cá estiver não se abrem mais portas
Olhos não vêem, então, o coração não sente
Se fosse a ti acreditava que o teu coração não mente
Estou na merda e penso em ti, tou sozinho e penso em ti
Mas tu andas a procura de algo que não em mim, baby
Quando saio sem carinho, quando bazo e nunca ligo
Nunca ouves aquilo que eu digo, estou a cuidar do meu umbigo
O sol nasceu e tu nao sabes onde eu ando
E se eu disser que vou mudar (...)

[Refrão]
Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que eu não me vou embora
Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que já está na hora
Ela só quer que eu lhe mostre que mais nada importa

Ela só quer que eu lhe diga que já está na hora
Ela só quer que eu lhe mostre que mais nada importa
Mas tudo o que ela quer, para mim, agora, é foda

Um dia eu volto só para ficar contigo
Um dia eu volto só para casar contigo
Sou como os dom boys, eu não minto
Então quem diz a verdade não merece castigo
Um dia eu volto só para ficar contigo
Um dia eu volto só para casar contigo
Sou como os dom boys, eu não minto

Mais um dia que não me traz nada
Só mais uma noite que me deixa mais calmo
Estou na merda mas ninguém vê nada
O mundo está a dormir e eu por dentro não páro
Não fales, não me olhes, não me toques, não penses que eu não estou cá
Fui tentar saber quem sou, ninguém me disse nada
Quero bazar daqui, mas agora não dá
Olha só como ela é tão gira
Olha como é lindo como o mundo gira
Man, não me estás a entender
Não consigo ver beleza em nada, em mim só tenho ira
Não apareças, não quero ver pessoas
Não finjas, eu não estou na boa
Não estou no mundo, não estou na tua, não estou no palco, não estou na rua, não estou no mundo
Estou sentado, estou sem tecto
Estou sentado aqui perto
À espera que isto mude sem eu fazer nada em concreto
E ya, quero bulir, ya quero curtir
Ya, quero tudo mas não consigo
Então me digas que eu não tenho o que não é preciso
Ya, não tenho pica para nada, sou um bicho

Sou eu a falsa calma, um lugar vazio na cama
Sou eu só com sucata na rua, sou homem sem alma

Sou eu só uma sucata na rua, sou homem sem alma
Sou só homem sem alma e quero voltar para casa

Estou deitado na cama há quatro horas a tentar dormir, mas ainda não vai ser agora
Fecho os olhos e volto para o lugar onde eu não quero estar, mas não consigo ir embora
Alguém me ajude, esta merda não sou eu
Alguma coisa me tirou a força que a vida me deu
Alguém me leve para um sítio onde eu ache que nunca tive
Foda-se, o gajo enloqueceu
Estou com o people todo à minha volta
Fora do meu corpo, vejo tudo à minha roda
Estou de fora, 'bora, quero ir embora, man
Mais nada me importa
Achas que eu quero ser companhia para ti
Eu sou o herói, a estrela, assim, sou só o fim
Não me drogo, não bebo, mas dava jeito eu contra o meu pensamento
Mn, nada feito
Muita gente, muita luz e não sei onde é que pus
A força de viver e o amor no peito
Eles gritam, pisam-te, dizem-te que és o melhor do mundo
Eles não entendem, paz agora era tudo

[Bridge]
Então, onde é que estás?
Onde é que vais?
Sei lá como, mas vem cá salvar-me
Eu sei que vens, mas vem mais, porque até chegares eu não estou cá
Onde é que estás?
Onde é que vais?
Sei lá como, mas vem cá salvar-me
Eu sei que vens, mas vem mais porque até chegares eu não estou cá

Sou eu a falsa calma, lugar vazio na cama
Sou eu só uma sucata na rua, sou homem sem alma
Sou só homem sem alma e quero voltar para casa
Sou só homem sem alma e quero voltar para casa

Sou eu a falsa calma, lugar vazio na cama
Sou eu só uma sucata na rua, sou homem sem alma
Sou só homem sem alma e quero voltar para casa
Sou só homem sem alma e quero voltar para casa

[Dengaz]
Quando estás assim, mano, entendo o que sentes
Quando me dizes que está tudo bem, quando mentes
Quantos como tu, quantos escondem como tudo
Aquilo que sentem e não aguentam e não vencem
Está na hora de bazar, eu bazei
E por tudo o que passaste, eu parei e pisei
Por tudo o que eu passei, eu parei e pensei
Foda-se, olha no que me tornei
Nunca mais quero voltar
Mas o perigo é eminente e eu vou ter que lutar
Para poder ver o bem que tu me fazes
A luz que tu me trazes
Tu és o meu lugar
Já chega de estar aqui, eu não sou assim
Eles não acreditam pensam que esta merda é farsa
Pára e olha pra mim
Vê que eu não estou aqui, só quero ir pra casa

When I awoke one morning
There was a feeling in the air
Everything was quiet
Things were different everywhere
The Wobblies were back again
With Joe Hill at the mike
When all the minimum-wage workers went on strike

There was no one flipping burgers
All the grills were cold
Onion rings were in their bags
Fries were growing mold
There were no baristas at Starbucks
Asking, ""How many shots would you like?""
When all the minimum-wage workers went on strike

There was no one pumping gasoline
No one driving from town to town
No one at the registers
All the highways were shut down
The cars were stuck in their garage
Businessmen on bikes
When all the minimum-wage workers went on strike

The fruit was falling off the trees
No one to load the trucks
Corn was rotting on the stalk
No farm hands to shuck
The workfare workers were hanging at home
Spending the day with their tykes
When all the minimum-wage workers went on strike

Yuppie parents were housebound
Their nannies left the job
Wal-Mart workers said,""Enough
Of our labor has been robbed.""
The FootLocker was locked up
The boss had to take a hike
When all the minimum-wage workers went on strike

(Repeat first verse)

When we're living in the White House
And debating on the hill
Of all your crazy antics
We'll all have had our fill
We'll be closing down munitions plants
And Old Glory will be furled
'Cause we don't want your big machines
We just want the world

And a bill will be proposed
Section number one
We're shutting down the oil rigs
And turning towards the sun
The air will be clean
For all the boys and girls
'Cause we don't want your oil tankers
We just want the world

Face the executioner
Shut the logging camps all down
Get busy planting hemp
Leave the trees there in the ground
Life is too precious
On this little, spinning pearl
We don't want your bulldozers
We just want the world

We'll be closing down the jails
And fixing up the schools
Distributing those stocks and bonds
Changing all the rules
We'll elect a CEO
Maybe a rabbit or a squirrel
'Cause we don't want your money
We just want the world

We'll be swimming in the rivers
And running to the hills
Reading in the history books
Of wars and oil spills
If it's linear we'll bend it
If it's a straight line it'll curl
'Cause we don't want your dead-end highway
We just want the world

When we're living in the White House
And debating on the hill
Of all your crazy antics
We'll all have had our fill
We'll be closing down munitions plants
And Old Glory will be furled
'Cause we don't want your big machines
We just want the world

I wish I was up in Vancouver
At the Cannabis Cafe
Smoking good old sensemelia
At the beginning of the day

But here I am in New York City
Hiding out in Central Park
Getting kidnapped by the police
Today sometime before dark

But I wish I was up in Vancouver...

The judge looked down upon me, frowing
He said, ""kid, get on your way
""Just don't start out your morning
""With espresso and a j""

I said I wish I was up in Vancouver...

I hitched a ride out to Portland
Caught one up to B.C
Took a bus over to Hastings Street
To have a bowl with my coffee

Now I'm up in Vancouver...

Ford built tanks for the Nazis
And the Nazis used those tanks
To gun down lots of soldiers
In the U.S. Army ranks
Yes, Henry Ford was a fascist
And a nasty one was he
He'd build tanks for anyone
For the proper fee

Henry Ford spoke to his lackeys
And he said, ""isn't this great?
""We'll attack our enemies
""And we'll retaliate!""
Henry Ford was a fascist
And a cunning liar, too
A brownshirt with a swastika
Draped in red, white and blue

Henry Ford spoke to his workers
And he said, ""you dare not strike!
""You must be patriotic
""And take on my Third Reich!""
Yes, Henry Ford was a fascist
\ And he had not a care
About the dying soldiers
That made him a billionaire

Ford built tanks for the Nazis
And he built many more
To kill off lots of peasants
In Peru and Salvador
Yes, Henry Ford was a fascist
I heard that when he died
The last words to leave his lips
Was ""arbeit macht frei""

The dollar was his icon
On whichever shore
And Henry's only motto
Was ""make money and make war""
Yes, Henry Ford was a fascist
That's all I have to say
I will spit on Henry's rotting grave
Until my dying day

Disrespect my name, as you step into the
Game
Repel this morality, under guidance from
The state
My money rules these fools to lose
Extortion, abortion, never proved
You take what's sacred and you rip it out of
Me

Disrespect my hate, tap this vein, eradicate
Break reality, wrap it up in the world we see
Fight with fire, wonder why the house burns
Down
God damn liar, ship of lies this country

Got to share
Share with you
All my fears coming true
Almost 30, right on time
Gonna spend my life just chasing the fire
Chasing the fire

You, you're my baby
You, you're my baby

[Verse 2]
I've been shot down by the law
By the law
Of business leading this world
Where's my money?
I don't mind
Gonna play some music
Every night

[Chorus]
No more blaming, I will live in summer
We will always stay young
It's a radical leap
I'm gonna seed a yard

[?]

[Verse 4]
My eclectic side is down
All I need is to leave this town
California, I'm coming
Back to you

In the bottom, cheer them up till they're young
In the bottom, cheer them up till they're young
In the bottom, cheer them up till they're young

[Chorus]
No more blaming, I will live in summer
We will always stay young
It's a radical leap
I'm gonna seed a yard

[Chorus]
No more blaming, I will live in summer
We will always stay young
It's a radical leap

Good morning
Everybody got to get up
Are you ready for your new career?
Need a J, O, B

Bag of bones I’m gonna put you there
And I’m an old bag of bones
But believe I get down
Come on
You got to try a little bit harder
Yeah
You got to think about it
You got to get your head out of the past
Get down
Stop pulling on my chain you cheap marionette
There’s a short cut to hell through the discothèque
A bag of bones ain’t no zombie brain
Activate the body
Reject the same
Pick it up
Aye
Do you remember the 1990s?
Do you remember the 1980s?
Do you remember the 1970s?
Too many squares
Too many slogans
Too many slogans
Too many squares
Too much mediocrity
Pick it up
Man of my nature always got to trip
‘Cause the jazz that you pushing make you sound like a drip
I need something weird, I need something strange
I’m a mean bag of bones don’t got to explain
That’s right
Bag of bones I’m gon’ put you down
And I’m an old bag of bones
Honey, you’re just a clown
Fuck

Bones

When I get to my baby
I get some kinda crazy thrill
Do you remember talking silly?
Oh so pretty, oh, nine thirty, Capitol Hill
Like church bell ring
You struck me loud and clear
You put some crazy kinda way right between my ears
Come on now
Oh, I’m gonna get that thing
Got to do that
Aye, I’m gonna feel so strange
I’m Looking hard at your bone and meat
It’s true true love will knock you off of your feet
Strange
I find my baby
Strange
Ohh
God almighty, I feel all right
But there’s bound to be trouble in the middle of the night
Engraved, gold, embossed wedding invitation
Mama, we got to rock ‘n’ roll all across the nation
Strange
I find my baby

Uh

So sad [unknown]

A gente pode se divertir
Falar mal dos vigaristas desse país
E de outros países também
Não vamo deixar faltar pra ninguém

Na entrada libera o proscênio
Acende lâmpadas de tungstênio
Destempera
Libera o oxigênio
Não vamo deixar faltar ar pra ninguém
Também da janela de Copacabana
Me assusto com a visão de mundo

Mas vejo longe do poço o fundo
Minhas pernas optam por minha cama
O estrado é forte e reserva
Pra quaresmas fartas e soberbas
Um caririnho frutífero
Que austero porém, meu peito preserva
E os números quase acerta
E a sorte quase leva

Por falta de consciência tranqüila
Passou o dia cozinhando arroz na panela
Que pressão!
E agora estragou os versos
E ainda explodiu o fogão

Lock the door
Twice

One time for me
One time for you
And come lie down

No one leaves their safe zone
It’s not safe down here

High buildings

Who’s that knocking don’t bother walking it’s just the wind

Who are we to judge?

Here we are
Can’t remember why
It’s such a trip when you try

(Chorus)
Some things never happen
You draw all the action
Stand up in the mirror
Millionaire

(Verse)
Four nights I’ve sit the crimes
Lookin at shoes, the childs of knives

(Chorus)
Some things never happen
You draw all the action
Stand up in the mirror
Millionaire

(Verse)
Slow down and take your tissue now
You sit down
Wonders come

(Chorus)
Some things never happen
You draw all the action
I bestow the miracle

(Verse)
Thinking about what it all has to do
Inside a darkened there’s nothing left to steal
Jesus Christ, my name is true
And the soft air shaking the afternoon

(Verse)
I was sleeping on a subway train
I couldn’t get my lane with a golden tail
I can see what is wrong with me
But I can’t conceive what I’ve fall into

(Chorus)
It’s somewhere that’s so deep
I fell asleep in a hurricane
It made you late for school
And I’m driving fast to meet this fool

(Verse)
If you’d like it you could have some too
But now make up time is equity
It’s only nothing that you haven’t seen
Something deep with feel prior to

(Chorus)
It’s somewhere that’s so deep
I fell asleep in a hurricane
It made you late for school
And I’m driving fast to meet this fool

(Verse)
Even if you can’t forgive my ways
Then it’s cool, I agree with what your mother says
But knowing you were down
I was taking hits when you were on the ground

(Chorus)
It’s somewhere that’s so deep
I fell asleep in a hurricane
It made you late for school
And I’m driving fast to meet this fool
It’s somewhere that’s so deep
I fell asleep in a hurricane
It made you late for school
And I’m driving fast to kill… to kill…

Tranquilly laboring at all love's cultivation

How ephemeral our grace is in these wind stricken plains
But I do believe

Away from the mountains of youth and safety
Oh, fragile meadow
In a fragile meadow
Fragile meadow (x3)

You are my companion and true lover, woman

Through our rains and wintry phases
I have come to love you
Love you for you (x8)

There's a cellphone tucked under your pillow
It makes me junk-sleep
And it doesn't do a thing for growth hormones or dreams
You hear a ringtone but it's just an electronic bleat
It makes you junk-sleep
And the phantom-phone rings on, until we fall asleep at dawn

Was that a ghost-call or drunk-dial?
I'll build a big fat wall, I'll build it 20 feet tall

And when we awake it's vampire-time
And I'll know you for real
And then late at night, when it's drunk-dial time
I'll tell you how I feel
Was that a ghost-call or drunk-dial?
I'll build a big fat wall, I'll build it 20 feet tall

The kids have found a weapon that will change the balance of power
They download high-pitch ringtones
That adults can't hear with their aging ears
The kids have found a weapon, that adults can't hear with their aging ears
That adults can't hear with their aging years

I need a key to your tolerance-room
Where you keep all your books I assume

I was thinking about the end of the story that I'm in
Let's walk to the horizon and just leave them wondering
The closing titles should begin with ""it was not enough""
I guess back then you knew I wasn't ready for your love

I believe that time will teach me when
We'll meet again and climb our ladder to the moon
This is almost home

I thank you for the rain that showed me there are times of doubt
It made me wonder about the sun and gave meaning to the clouds
I'm happy to be here, knowing where I'll be someday
With your heart close to mine we'll keep the black moods far away

I believe that time will teach me when
We'll meet again and climb our ladder to the moon
This is almost home

A wonderful morning light
Couldn't help myself
It's off again

And maybe I'll take a ride
To the desert folds
Or just relent

As everything turns to rust
Amend

I'm hoping I'll see enough
By then

And I'll call off
Yes, I'll call off

I'm moving my head
I'm turning my neck
To see
The fuck ups underground

They shouldn't be there
They shouldn't be scared
Of this
A world of things to come
It's enough

A wonderful morning light
Is inviting me
To come again

I'll make it up to you, man
I will push myself
Into your hands

As everything turns to rust
Amend

I'm hoping I'll see enough
By then

And I'll call off
Yes I'll call off

I'm moving my head
I'm turning my neck
To see
The fuck ups underground

They shouldn't be there
They shouldn't be scared
Of this
A world of things to come
It's enough

If I can just stay awake
And believe in everyone

"
73964,"

If there's a place in your head
Where you can go be jaded
Then you should go and turn off
A body overrated

Would you believe in all the answers
If all had gone your way?
When you believed in all the aswers
I should've known you then

I notice in my heart
That you can lead astray
I keep it in my heart
It's just another phase
It keeps me up in arms
There's something else in place
It's just one little spark
That we can never trace

If there's a sun in the sky
And then a moon late at night
Then we can know the order
Has been sustained throughout time

Would you believe in all the answers
If all had gone your way?
When you believed in all the aswers
I should've known you then

I notice in my heart
That you can lead astray
I keep it in my heart
It's just another phase
It keeps me up in arms
There's something else in place
It's just one little spark
That we can never trace

That we can never trace
That we can never trace

Keep it in my heart

Wendy, you're stuck in my game, I know
Wouldn't be here without pain, for sure
50 years on, no one will know
The delicate, humdrum ways of this love

If you can keep up someday
Finally face to face
It's something I'll learn to take
If you can keep up someday

There's still an ocean between us, love
Everything hurts when it's not enough
If you rely on the coldest nights
Look in my head for what's not in sight

Wendy, you're hurt that I came back home
Wouldn't be here without pain, I know

If you can keep up someday
Finally face to face
It's something I'll learn to take
If you can keep up someday

There's still an ocean between us, love
Everything hurts when it's not enough
If you rely on the coldest nights
Look in my head for what's not in sight

I've heard of a song without a name
It stays the same
And everyone learns the melodies
It's just the name
We need

Summer, summer
Bring the ghost to me
It's what I want

In its silence
It will let me hear
It's just so fun

Pace yourself to the beat of the drums
I am hoping for something else
Move your hands, tell me what I should learn
This is nothing like I expected

I've heard of a chorus melody
That's in the air
I need you take it off the list
It's only fair to me

Summer, summer
Bring the ghost again
It's what I want

In its silence
It will let me hear
It's just so fun

Pace yourself to the beat of the drums
I am hoping for something else
Move your hands, tell me what I should learn
This is nothing like I expected

And everything you say will turn me on
There's nothing like falling for a ghost in summer clothes

Won't you come to me?
To the safest rock
I will show you its place

"
73967,"

Once you let in the troubles from your past
Once again
Take your time and decide which ones were worth
All the fights

That is all that I ask
Summer knows you the best

So once you learn every color coded word
That I wrote
Move your heart sing it, burn it in you mind
Once again

And now that you want me
I waste my love
And now that you know me
I waste my love
Let me tell you, I've seen better days

(We could make it work
Better turn me up)

That is all that I ask
Some believe it's a test

That is all that I ask
Summer knows you the best

And now that you want me
I waste my love
And now that you know me
I waste my love
And no more falling back
Let me tell I've seen better days

Better days
Better days

"

When I was younger
Breaking the law
With my alarm bells
Keeping me dull

If I believed you
I'd be on my way
Watching the fire
Dust in the air

Oh, I was off
I was here
With you

Watching the fire
Breaking the law
With my alarm bells
Keeping me dull

"
73969,"

I heard you've never been sober
And the haze is only the start
Fish dip brought in a basket
A position I cannot watch

Once you take what you like
Raise your shoulders and shut your eyes
I will stand close enough
Making sure that the flame is not alive

So you recognize
It's a lullaby
Won't it shut you up?

I heard you've never been certain
Of the days spent breaking the law
You keep 'em all in a basket
A decision I cannot watch

Once you take what you like
Raise your shoulders and shut your eyes
I will stand close enough
Making sure that the flame is not alive

So you recognize
It's a lullaby
Won't it shut you up?

If it moves out
On it's on
I should not delay

If it comes down
To staying strong
Or rushing for the brakes

Well, the decision's come
Up into the river
Down into the river's arms

Cause I can go on
Yes I can go on

"
73970,"

Wishing I was fair to you
And all you do
But keeping me alive is what
I'm hoping for
Never even seen you stare
A little hurt
Celebrating empathy
It comes and goes

I should've noticed you are not afraid of blood
Should've noticed you are not afraid of blood
Should've noticed you are not afraid of blood
Should've noticed you're not

As I am on the first step
Of looking up the sad facts
You've been leaving bodies everywhere you go

Mission is accomplished
Convoluted, lovesick
I can see the bodies now

When I was there
I wasn't toiling for the others
(Keep 'em apart)
Functioning hearts
Shouldn't be filled with all the others

I should've noticed you can be a little much
Should've noticed you can be a little much
Should've noticed you can be a little much
Should've heard your sighs, the cracking of the earth

As I am on the first step
Of looking up the sad facts
You've been leaving bodies everywhere you go

Mission is accomplished
Convoluted, lovesick
I can see the bodies now

When the sun is up
When the sun is up
When the sun is up
I will bury them all

"
73971,"

Well, I want my voice again
It might pull me out
Of a nationwide abyss
Make it overground

When it comes, it goes off
Summer's almost out
Get me off this water
Have you seen me now?

There's no alarms today

No other stops
No false alarms
What did you say?

This is what I've got for you
Don't you know by now
Tell me who you're listening to
Could I hold some ground?

Well, it's for you
It is for you
And I want my voice again
Coming from your face

There's no alarms today

No other stops
No false alarms
What did you say?

"
73972,"

When our houses
Fall apart
In time

I wil stay here
In my place
No trials

Cause I'm alright
Yes I'm alright
And I'm just fine
Yes I'm just fine

When our soldiers
Fall behind
Torn up

I will go on
And recruit
My sons

Cause I'm alright
Yes I'm alright
And I'm just fine
Yes I'm just fine

And if we don't stand a chance
It will be over then
Watching the other boys
We are not able to

To be so sure
Of our paths
To be so lost
In our treks

Cause I'm alright
Yes I'm alright
And I'm just fine
Yes I'm just fine

Tell me why...
We worry about the money all the time?
People shoot and people die to get the money
To get fly or get high
Tell me why? Why? Why..
Does everybody want a better life?
On TV we see things we like
And when we get 'em we're not satisfied
I can't tell you why…

But I know one thing and that's a fact
If you ain't got no money then you can't buy that
So we all break the rules and make up our own
But we don't stick to 'em. How far will thou go?

Until it comes to an end?
You make some bad moves and betray you own friends?
Now they're down to ride
They roll up around the back and sneak up on the side
And now you got a laser in your eye
It crosses your mind, you realize today you're going to die
Today you're going to die


So if you think you know then what you don't know is
That you don't know and
You got to keep you ears open, kick it until it's broken
Spit it until it's spoken
And it's ok to laugh at them even if they're not joking
I don't know what but to tell you that you gotta keep hoping

But I know one thing and that's a fact
If you ain't got no money then you can't buy that
So we all break the rules and make up our own
But we don't stick to 'em. How far will thou go?

Until it comes to an end?
You make some bad moves and betray you own friends?
Now they're down to ride
They roll up around the back and sneak up on the side
And now you got a laser in your eye
It crosses your mind, you realize today you're going to die
Today you're going to die

So tell me why, why why…
We worry about the money all the time
People shoot, people die
To get the money, get fly or get high

[Verse 1]

It's going down down baby up the elevator
From the balcony we're waving at the haters
Jet set daily but I'll see you later
If you're looking for the real thing
So won't you step step baby to my oval office
We won't have to worry bout economics
I'm so modest while being honest
I could be the next big thing

[Pre-Chorus]

I'm not a king
But I'm a gent
And if you let me I'll be a president
I'll write a speech I'll make it count
And we can move into my big big house
I'm not a thief
I'm not a crook
So why your best friends give me dirty looks
I'll prove them wrong
I have no doubt
So would you please just hear me out

[Chorus]

Cuz you say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)
You say they always keep you up with american music
(I'm in the foreign car bumping Erykah Badu)
You say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)
You say the always swoop down like american falcon
(I try to swoop down baby but I can't help it)

[Verse 2]

So sweet sweet baby sweeter than a soda pop
But your daddy's meaner than a robo cop
He don't trust me so I wrote a song about how I'm never gonna lay hands
Lets go downtown baby like you were petula
Like my name I got it from Medulla
Once I was a loser
Then I left school and now I am a self-made man

[Pre-Chorus]

I understand that you're concerned
Because I'm not quite ready for the church
And when I leave to go to war
You think that you won't see anymore
But I'll be back in just a sec
To wrap my arms around your pretty next
And if you think you'll realize
That we are underneath the same blue skies

[Chorus]

Cuz you say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)
You say they always keep you up with american music
(I'm in the foreign car bumping Erykah Badu)
You say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)
You say the always swoop down like american falcon
(I try to swoop down baby but I can't help it)

[Bridge]

Whoa is me (4x)
I can't bear to have another man lost at sea
He was a firework but then he met Poseidon
I swore I wouldn't love a another sea plane pilot
MY album got five stars so I earned my stripes
You said I know you're pigheaded but you're just my type
I'm singing shimmy shimmy cocoa pop shimmy shimmy pow
Shimmy shimmy cocoa pop shimmy shimmy pow

[Chorus]

Cuz you say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)
You say they always keep you up with american music
(I'm in the foreign car bumping Erykah Badu)
You say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)
You say the always swoop down like american falcon
(I try to swoop down baby but I can't help it)

[Ending (4x)]

You say you try to keep away from american boys
(I said baby what's wrong with american boys)

Sittin in the backseat waitin for your brother
To come back from the gas station
Said hardly anything to one another
Cus it seemed like an awkward situation
I got nothin against your girlfriend
She seemed perfectly sweet and everything
But I wish I woulda met you back in the old days
When you were a free man
You say you gave your hand away
But that don’t mean
That I can’t take it
Just for a minute and
I say I’m sick of love
But that don’t mean
That we can’t make it
I wanna make it with you
It’s a really long drive back to the city
And your brother doesn’t talk a lot
And I wasn’t gonna ask you anything personal
But I guess I just forgot
Cus I get a little antsy sittin in the backseat
Starin at your tattoos
Oh, we both know its a battle of will
And I don’t like to lose
You say you gave your hand away
But that don’t mean
That I can’t take it
Just for a minute and
I say I’m sick of love
But that don’t mean
That we can’t make it
I wanna make it with you
It isn’t that you’re so incredible
I don’t event think you’re smart
It isn’t that you’re unforgettable
I don’t wanna steal your heart
Baby its an invitation
Maybe just a one night stand
I don’t wanna a conversation
I don’t wanna make you my man
You say you gave your hand away
But that don’t mean
That I can’t take it
Just for a minute and
I say I’m sick of love
But that don’t mean
That we can’t make it
I wanna make it with you

I want to part the red sea of brake lights and traffic cones
So we can be together, so we can be together alone

Tell me now have I passed my exit or have I yet to arrive
My driving has been so reckless, I'm surprised I still have my life
The cold wind blows, and I can see you in the rearview reminding me

Who I am
Where I'm from
What I used to call home
I haven't been in so long. (x2)

I can see that my time is passing with the mile markers along the road
Replaying scenes in my head and hearing words that you spoke
To me when you were upset
I don't want to be
Something that you will regret
So tell me

Who I am
Where I'm from
What I used to call home
I haven't been in so long. (x5)

The warming moon came not a day too soon
The warming moon cast a pale strawberry glow

Open the shades open the wine and call the outsiders
A sight for sore eyes

The old woman is young again
The ground has softened
The morning is bright
The larks have returned
The devil's gone blind

We will sink into a sea of pink and ultramarine
The water is clean
So easy it seems to begin

The warming moon came not a day too soon
The wolves have moved deep into the wood
The day is good

In the capital cities and the wide open range
The altar is built on the backs
With a heavy axe
And scholar's stacks
On railroad tracks
By candle wax

Spilled on the back of an envelope
Containing a simple note
Insulating a great unknown

I live in these white walls alone
No regard for where I'm going or where I'm coming from
I smoke my weed and watch TV
Doing all this thinking's made me weary on my feet

The night is young
I would rather sleep than remember the things I've lost
When I close my eyes
I can hear a ringing in my ears from words you said to me all night

Been talking to myself a lot
Seeing your reflection in the sunglasses I bought
And I swear, if I see your face
I will keep on living, pretend I don't know your name

I am a liar
I miss almost everything about you and your smile
When I close my eyes
I can hear a ringing in my ears from words you said to me all night

I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
You said you never loved me and I know you never will

“In Tune” Remix
Written by Kellee Maize
Produced by J. Glaze


[Intro]
In, in, tune, in in in tune 3X

[Chorus]
I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be
We already are you and me, psychically
In tune to the stars
We already are you and me, psychically

[2X]
In tune to the
In in in tune in in tune 2X
In 10X

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fight like cats and dogs
But here we are giving it our all
So many years in the making
But then forsaking and forgetting
Even for a moment I am not betting on our demise
I can see the future in your eyes
I see the presence ironic surprise
When you go counter and I clockwise
And through the world’s pain and all the lies
We will grow a garden every time
And if I harden will you remind
Me of the softness I had in my prime
And if I seek will you help me find
And when I freak won't you be kind
Know there’s sometimes demons in my mind
What can I say it’s hard to be an interdimensional bride

[Chorus]
I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
The earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be
We already are you and me, psychically
In tune to the stars
We already are you and me, psychically

(x3)
In tune to the
In in in tune in in tune (x2)
In (x10)

[Verse 2]
You might as well get used to this
Death due us part here healthy or sick
I gotta eternity to wait
And I know I’m choosing my own fate
And even if I was burned at the stake
I would reincarnate like a yogi in a lotus
From the mud we are exploded
I didn’t walk to you, I floated
When empty you help me get reloaded

[Chorus]
I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be
We already are you and me, psychically
In tune to the stars
We already are you and me, psychically

Come down to the surface
The surface reflects the light
Beneath the outer
The darkness obscures the light
Come down to the shallows
In contours
Out of the rivers
Your sea pours
Wait for the water
To claim you
Your sea returning
Into the waves
Into the wind waves
Into the waves
Curling heights
Back into the center
Receding from a further shore
Sinking familiar
Clinging to blackest floors

Come out to the shallows
In contours
Into the rivers your sea pours
Wait for the water to claim you
Your sea returning
Into the waves
Into the wind waves
Into the waves
Curling heights

Come down to the shallows

Your sea returning

Study the velvet light
In your room
Trace the years that fell upon our heads
Gone confused
In time you find a friend that you know
Won't know you
For time is like a banging drum
Set to solitude
Stay awake
You're far from view
Now you're floating on nowhere
Can't turn away from all the pain of the world
It won't go for you
Stay awake
You're far from view
Are you feeling it coming?
Can't run away from all the pain of the world
That won't comfort you
The sun is to color the sky
Simple hues
Feather light that dissipates unites
Around you
The planets are aligned in your palm
With nothing to do
But spin around the heavens saying
There is no hope for you
Stay awake
You're far from view
Now you're floating on nowhere
Can't turn away from all the pain of the world
It won't go for you

"
75035,"

At a milky way
That nobody showed her
Lovers gazing
How long to be tender?
Looked up to the
Stars to relate
The skies blur over
Deep inside a fever sleep
The dead air curls
And begs to be breathed
She’s a fool
But time is a thief
When it comes in to say
Her love has to wait
Will the sky burn open?

Dying it
Just to lose

We don't have wonder why you're blue
Found a way to feel again
We don't have to see half blind
Into your wondrous eyes
Run colors

Turn round
Come back
We dream on
One track

We don't have to wonder why you're blue
Found a way to feel again
We don't have to see half blind
Into your wondrous eyes
Run colors

Private Manning was an analyst if what they say is true
He was paid to read reports and find the patterns sifting through
As he read the data the patterns did emerge
Patterns that were clear both before and since the Surge
Patterns of abuse of the most horrific kind
Gunning down civilians out of view and out of mind
Gunning down the opposition in the middle of the night
Sending off the scholars to be tortured out of sight
Sometimes you need desperate measures when you live in desperate times
And Private Manning saw he was looking at war crimes
He wondered what to do to allow the dead to speak
He finally decided to contact Wikileaks
Now it's all out on the table and everybody knows
The emperor is naked, he's not wearing any clothes

Now Adrian Lamo has to live within his skin
He stabbed Bradley in the back, called the cops and turned him in
But not before the soldier took half a million files
If you printed all the pages they'd stretch on for miles
Evidence against the state right from the horse's mouth
Machinations in the west, bombings in the south
A treasure trove of details for all the globe to see
How much they need to lie and kill for democracy
How many drone strikes have hit villages leaving everyone to die
They blamed on someone else -- the official line, ""Not I""
How many coups have been plotted by ambassadors who say
That free and fair elections be the order of the day
Now it's all out on the table and everybody knows
The emperor is naked, he's not wearing any clothes

Now the Genie's out of the bottle and they're trying to stuff it back
And stop it from illuminating everything we lack
Such as the rule of law or playing by the book
Look you can read it, it's right here, the ship of state is run by crooks
And they vilify the messengers, call them every name
For daring to blow the whistle on the nature of their game
The game of taking lives and endangering the rest
In order for the wealthy few to do what they do best
Dominate the world for the corporate elite
But now their cover's blown from their head down to their feet
And now the stars and stripes is looking much more like a rag
The lid is off the box, the cat's out of the bag
Now it's all out on the table and everybody knows
The emperor is naked, he's not wearing any clothes

I don't drive a car because they run on gas
But if I did, it'd run on biomass
I ride a bike, or sometimes a skateboard
So fuck off all you drivers and your yuppie whores
Sitting all day in the traffic queues
I'm a better anarchist than you

I don't eat meat; I just live on moldy chives
Or the donuts that I found in last week's dumpster dives
Look you people in that restaurant, I think you are so sad
When you could've been eating bagels like the ones that I just had
I think it is a shame all the bourgeois things you do
I'm a better anarchist than you

I don't wear leather and I like my clothes in black
And I made a really cool hammock from a moldy coffee sack
I like to hop on freight trains, I think that is so cool
It's so much funner doing this than being stuck in school
I can't believe you're wearing those brand new shiny shoes
I'm a better anarchist than you

I don't have sex and there will be no sequel
Because heterosexual relationships are inherently unequal
I'll just keep on moshing to Anti-Flag and Clash
Until there are no differences in gender, race or class
All you brainwashed breeders, you just haven't got a clue
I'm a better anarchist than you

I am not a pacifist, I like throwing bricks
And when the cops have caught me and I've taken a few licks
I always feel lucky if I get a bloody nose
'Cause I feel so militant and everybody knows
By the time the riot is all through
I'm a better anarchist than you

I don't believe in leaders; I think consensus is the key
I don't believe in stupid notions like representative democracy
Whether or not it works, I know it is the case
That only direct action can save the human race
So when I see you in your voting booths then I know it's true
I'm a better anarchist than you
I'm a better anarchist than you

Rodney Coronado was arrested for a speech
That he gave one evening by the San Diego beach
He stated his opinions, they sounded just like mine
And now they want to put him behind bars til 2029

The prosecutor said the problem was the speech it showed intent
I couldn't figure out exactly what he meant
You can't describe an action and say you thought that it was swell
So what'll happen when we sing this, who the heck can tell

(Chorus)
We don't like the condo (bulldozer, Wal-Mart) and we're gonna burn it down
Corporate terrorists, drive them out of town
We'll bring a lot of gasoline, pour it on the floor
Light a match, say a prayer and run right out the door
Burn it down, burn it down, we're going to burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

Now if you just sang that chorus then you just broke the law
To be an eco-terrorist now you just gotta flap your jaw
And hey who knows by the time you have a chance to blink
Whether you're a criminal might depend on what you think

(Chorus)
Now they come for Rod, maybe next they come for you
And I'll tell you what I think all of us should do
Sing this song with me, raise your fist and caterwaul
If we fight together they can't arrest us all

Dreary life unfolding desperately
TV screens punctuate my sleepless nights
Nothing goes through my senseless body
My mind drifts away without a sign
Without a sign of might

He came to me, rushed and hit me
Pulled me out of my despair, revealed my urges
Walking to the street, shattered me with each hit
We were like brothers, shelters from others

Looking for a goal, searching for an idol
I need a man to transfigure me
He'll be my guide, provide me strength and pride
Trying to reach him, I'll achieve my dream

The rivalry began to grow between us
Being a substitute, I can't bear this second place
That girl he's looking at, he doesn't know she's mine
He went too far, I have to get rid of him

Finally found my god, followed my idol
Needed a man to transfigure me
He is my guide, provides me strength and pride
Trying to reach him, I'll achieve my dream

Finally lost my god, destroyed my idol
Needed a man to transfigure me
He could be guide, provide me strength and pride
Now that I've killed him... my dreams

Love is the feeling just taken from your heart
A feeling is the tear just fallen on this heart
A tear is the sign when we're all lost
A sign is the hope that we're loved

Passion gets boring, no need to care
But still feel the need for a better end
They thought they could for their own good
But no one knew then how it would all end

Wind is the blow sent by your lonely god
A blow is the gift that fills our blood
A gift is our chance to be all seen
Chance makes us flow trough the wind

I prayed darkness not to come
'til she reads the scroll and reaches her crown
She prayed the moon not to fall
'til she finds the one that would wait her for
She prayed the sword not to fall
'til she gives her son the glitter of the sun
They prayed her son not to fall
'til he finds the force and reaches for his throne
For his throne

They've been walking for ages
Lived in pain and agony
Tears were pouring down on their faces
For their ideology

For the first time in a long time, they had an aim :
Fly over lands and mountains, then wait for a sign
They left wife and children behind as their past
Undergoing doubt and yearning overcame as fast

I prayed darkness not to come
'til she reads the scroll and reaches her crown
She prayed the moon not to fall
'til she finds the one that would wait her for
She prayed the sword not to fall
'til she gives her son the glitter of the sun
They prayed her son not to fall
'til he finds the force and reaches for his throne
For his throne

They've been walking for ages
Lived in pain and agony
Tears were pouring down on their faces
For their ideology
They've been walking for ages
Lived in pain and agony
Tried to separate the tears form their fears
For their ideology

They thought they could for their own good
But no one knew then how it would all end

A truth seems to rise from inevitable signs
Or do we see signs where we want to see them ?

Csillagport visz a tavaszi szél
Soha nem vész el, ami benne él
Száz történet vele száll
Ahogy tompán szól egy kopott gitár

Fényes csillag, forró tûz
Ó, ez az mi ehhez a helyhez fûz
Vége tán, vagy jön még valami más?

Édes érzés, tompa kín
Ó, miért erre visznek vágyaim?
Szívem erre, elmém arra vágy...

Válaszút elõtt állok
Most talán ráhibázok
Melyik út visz a boldogság felé...
Fájdalom és a könnyek, többé össze nem törnek
Ez az én életem, nem kérkedem
Csak megyek a cél felé

Hóvihart hoz a téli szél
Csak a jég és hó ami benne él
Beteríti, ki benne áll
Fuss, hát most ezen életed áll

Elvesztél de én megtalállak
Éles a szemem mint egy sasmadárnak
Karmaimból nincsen menekvés

Lecsapok és elragadlak
Hiába kiáltasz, meg nem hallhatnak
De cseppet sem kell félned többé már...

Válaszút elõtt állok
Most talán ráhibázok
Melyik út visz a boldogság felé...
Fájdalom és a könnyek, többé össze nem törnek
Ez az én életem, nem kérkedem
Csak megyek a cél felé

Porfödte, kies forró táj
Itt nem él túl, aki csodára vár
Vakító fény szûrõdik át
Én mégis várom inkább a csodát

Karjaimat széttárom
Ez lesz talán a legszebb álmom
Érzem, ahogy belémkap a szél...

Mint egy gyilkos hurrikán
Ez a vég, vagy egy álom csupán?
Kérlek, mondd meg mit is tehetnék...

Szállok a széllel, mint egy falevél
Ó, elszáradok, ha több esõ nem ér
Úszok az árral, mint egy liliom
Ó, évezredekig tart ez, jól tudom...

Ezer éve már, itt vagyok vétkesen
Mégis érzem azt, hogy létezem
Várok még, nincs bennem félelem
Várok rád, gyere velem!

Itt vagyok, mindig is itt leszek
Akkor is, ha néha elveszek...
Fájdalom, ó, mit tegyek
Add, hogy önmagam legyek!

Egy holló fagyott szárnnyal száll
Tarkopasz fák...
Rémálma valósággá vált

Amerre néz, csakis pusztaságot lát
Élelem nélkül várja a biztos halált
Hóvihar sûrûjében keresi a célját
Ily szörnyû telet eddig soha nem élt még át

Csillogó jégvirág...
Egy fagyott ablakpárkány
Mint egy délibáb
Reményfoltként száll
Kémény, melybõl füst tör fel, kioltva a jeges kínt
Õ lassan követi a rozsdás sínt...

Hófödte tér...
A körúton csak porhót fúj a szél
Szoborként néz...
Elfogadni még mindig nehéz

Az emberek alszanak még
Bár kinyithatná a varázsszelencét
Csak egy kívánság, mit kér
Hozzon élelmet a szél

Csillogó jégvirág...
Egy fagyott ablakpárkány
Mint egy délibáb
Reményfoltként száll
Kémény, melybõl füst tör fel, kioltva a jeges kínt
Õ lassan követi a rozsdás sínt...

Vörösen izzón, a távolból
Mint ragyogó tulipán
Feléledt tán a remény?
Íme egy kicsi lány

'Mondd, miért, ó miért állsz itt
Nagy, fekete madár?
Ha itt maradsz éhesen
Elragad a halál

De én majd megmentelek', szólt
S szaladt a kis leány
Majd vöröslõ, szép ruhájában
Magokat hoz talán...

És száll, csak száll a téren át
Hiába a hó és jég
Nem feledi sohasem azt
Ki megmentette életét

Csillogó jégvirág...
Egy fagyott ablakpárkány
Mint egy délibáb
Reményfoltként száll
Kémény, melybõl füst tör fel, kioltva a jeges kínt
Most újra kinyithatja szárnyait...

"

Ébredés egy sötét ágyon
Az új látomást várom
Odakint már nem süt a Hold
Jégesõ veri fel a port

Álomra hajtanám fejem
De most nincs senki itt velem
Magam maradtam magamhoz
De az álom új kalandot hoz

Színvarázs, egy furcsa örvény
A valóságon túl nincs törvény
Vágyaim mint léggömb, szállnak fel...
(a képekkel)
Sárkány, ki a tüzet fújja
A képzeletnek szabad az útja
Biztonságban zuhanok tovább...

Ki az, ki engem vár?
A Földön talán még lehet pár
Ki az, ki tõlem fél?
Nem élhet az, aki nem remél

Álmaimnak útján élem életem
Emlékeim száguldoznak féktelen
Rabja lettem vágyaimnak úgy érzem
Álomcsapda lett börtönöm, végzetem...

Forrás, mely a létet képzi
Elszakadt, az utat nézi
Kitörne a valóságból
De megrémült a távolságtól

Lázálmok a hited képzik
S messzirõl kínodat nézik
Mindent eléd tár
E hamis valóság

Véletlen, vagy ügyes lépés?
Nem használ az üres nézés
A távolban összefolyik minden
Menekülnék, de belém mart
Egy kéz, és megzavart
S elmém által szült világban tart

Végtelenben, egy távoli angyal
Megszólít, egy tompa hanggal
Megfordulok, nyílik a szárnya
Nem tudom még, mi lesz az ára

Tündököl, mint százezer gyémánt
Úgy kezel, mint egy ócska képmást
""A valóság partján élsz
De szétesel, elveszel...""

Váratlanul eltûnnek a képek
Szobámban a világ újra ébred
Szeretnék visszatérni még
(...a szép emlék...)
Megindul újra az élet
Visszatér belém a lélek
De ma éjjel újabb látomás vár rám...

Ki az, ki engem vár?
A Földön talán még lehet pár
Ki az, ki tõlem fél?
Nem élhet az, aki nem remél

Álmaimnak útján élem életem
Emlékeim száguldoznak féktelen
Rabja lettem vágyaimnak úgy érzem
Álomcsapda lett börtönöm, végzetem...

"
75268,"

Az óceán vizében
Hullámok torz tükrében
Látom emlékeim foszlányait
Egy élet áll mögöttem
Fényesen, tündöklõen
De lépni kell, ideje távozni

A lángok kigyulladtak
Elvágva a sötét múltat
A holdsugár megtörik a vízen
A kürtök megszólalnak
Érzem, nincsen visszaút
Elõttem áll egy mesés, hosszú út

Maradni nem lehet már
Eltûnt minden határ
Egy szebb jövõre vágyom
Igen, ez minden álmom
Vágyok a messzeségbe
A vadon rejtekébe
Nincsen semmi mi itt tart
Új lapra írok egy új dalt

Sötét van, alig látok
Azok is csupán álmok
A valóság gyorsan szertefoszlott
Világok, hegyek, völgyek
Bükkösök, öreg tölgyek
Egy új világ, mely lassan kitárul

De az új világ még távol
Pedig lelkem érte lángol
Nincs semmi, ami ehhez fogható
Elfog egy sötét érzés
De mostmár nincsen visszaút
Egy szív dobogása elhalkult, elhalkult...

Maradni nem lehet már
Eltûnt minden határ
Egy szebb jövõre vágyom
Igen, ez minden álmom
Vágyok a messzeségbe
A vadon rejtekébe
Nincsen semmi mi itt tart
Új lapra írok egy új dalt

Végtelen messzeségben
Fátyolos szendergésben
Ködös folyónak partja
Hol fûnek sincs már sarja

A folyóvíz vöröslik
Bosszúnak vére folyt itt
Ártatlan áldozatnak
Elbújni már nem tudtak

Ez a hely egy átkozott verem
Itt többé semmi nem terem
Ez a nap az áldás napja
Ordít az éjnek hangja

Egy zöld szempár
Mint rámtekint
Álmatlan éjszakában
Elviszi a kínt

Vérzõ könnycsepp
A földön loccsan szét
Megfognám, de nem érem el
A két kezét

Puszta létével töri meg a fényt
Itthagyja az elveszett reményt
Fájdalma örök, mégis él
S míg él, szüntelenül remél

Ez a hely egy átkozott verem
Itt többé semmi nem terem
Ez a nap az áldás napja
Ordít az éjnek hangja

Tûzesõ száll
Itt a halál
Kegyvesztett lény
Ó, jöjj hát fény

Égõ romok mindenhol
Félelmetes harag forr
Életlen fegyverrel megvág
És otthagy - viszlát világ!

Ez a hely egy átkozott verem
Itt többé semmi nem terem
Ez a nap az áldás napja
Ordít az éjnek hangja

A szempár most üresen
Néz le rám
Nem veszt sem éjszakát már
Sem több varázst
Messzi emlék
Csupán ez már
De soha nem felejtem
Ez a Vérmocsár

Puszta létével töri meg a fényt
Itthagyja az elveszett reményt
Fájdalma örök, mégis él
S míg él, szüntelenül remél

Elpusztít minden jóakarót
Eldob minden földi jót
Vérmocsár ez, egy álnok gaz
Itt többé semmi sem igaz

“In Tune” Remix
Written by Kellee Maize
Produced by J. Glaze


[Intro]
In, in, tune, in in in tune 3X

[Chorus]
I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be
We already are you and me, psychically
In tune to the stars
We already are you and me, psychically

[2X]
In tune to the
In in in tune in in tune 2X
In 10X

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fight like cats and dogs
But here we are giving it our all
So many years in the making
But then forsaking and forgetting
Even for a moment I am not betting on our demise
I can see the future in your eyes
I see the presence ironic surprise
When you go counter and I clockwise
And through the world’s pain and all the lies
We will grow a garden every time
And if I harden will you remind
Me of the softness I had in my prime
And if I seek will you help me find
And when I freak won't you be kind
Know there’s sometimes demons in my mind
What can I say it’s hard to be an interdimensional bride

[Chorus]
I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
The earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be
We already are you and me, psychically
In tune to the stars
We already are you and me, psychically

(x3)
In tune to the
In in in tune in in tune (x2)
In (x10)

[Verse 2]
You might as well get used to this
Death due us part here healthy or sick
I gotta eternity to wait
And I know I’m choosing my own fate
And even if I was burned at the stake
I would reincarnate like a yogi in a lotus
From the mud we are exploded
I didn’t walk to you, I floated
When empty you help me get reloaded

[Chorus]
I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be
We already are you and me, psychically
In tune to the stars
We already are you and me, psychically

(x3)
In tune to the
In in in tune in in tune (x2)
In (x10)

CHORUS
If you don’t start none, then there won’t be none
When you make your hell then you cannot run
Its like a secret, seems to have been kept from
The average person, forgot we’re all one

VERSE 1
The experiment is affected by the observer
I got a new dream I upload it on my server
You want to buy me out and I say how about a merger
Together we have fervor, then we will get further
What you see is what you get and I ain't done yet
As soon as I fret I'm thankful I ain't dead
You could say my attitude is that of gratitude
And you start acting rude and I say chill dude
You could start it you could end
Forgetting what you said
Created in your head, your enemy and friend
Belated in my send I evolutionize the dead
Open brains instead of puppets on a thread
From aliens I bled they operated on my head
Defeatin all the dread I got you outta bed
Many barely fed and our hands are red
Bleeding for the cred, fallin with no tread

CHORUS 3X

VERSE 2

You say you love me but want control
I’m not your robot I got a soul
I do not blame you the theory is old
Kept from the women and all the poor
You don’t realize how deep it gets
A few in power decide the steps
Now the tower fell with regret
A physop gone wrong and what’d we get
Illuminati with ill effects
Spiritual warfare and now what’s next
I got a class system kinda complex
Think I could uncreate this mess
The Rastah's they call me an empress
And with my energy I will bless
I obsess, it’s a test, I release my stress
Enlightened ones hope you’ll be impressed

CHORUS 3X

VERSE 3

The child soldiers they are a warning
Are you aware of the global morning
Video games numb the planets warming
The gate is open the bees are swarming
The polar sides the separate
Negative waits at positives gates
The magnets growing now clear the slate
Empty your mind now so much at stake
Turn off the news you know its all fake
Inside your brain disastrous quake
Powers inside of all of us to make
A heaven now for our children’s sake
Consciousness rise, it is our fate
Zeitgeist movie, they put it just great
Venus project, no one must take
We all will give, its not too late

CHORUS 3X

"
75385,
75386,"

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Do it!
Word to the mothership
Yeah we're on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
U See my soul
It chose this path
I won't back down
I've done the math
I'll steadily improve my craft
F*ck ignorance and race and class
Protect us from psychic attack
The odds against us cannot stack
If everyone has every back
Lack of respect is really wack
You wanna move I'll help you pack
Please don't be rude just stay on track
You cannot sell my tits and ass
I'm thinkin' soon you'll feel the wrath
From a god outside of us
The biggest lie in god we trust
You cannot see corrupted thrust
Powers that be are greed and lust
Word to the mothership
Yeah we're on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
Mayans told us bout the shift
Please do not fear this is our gift
We aren't alone put down that splif
Slow down your roll and don't get stiff
Get steady and connect with earth
She will ground to the place of birth
We won't compete we'll share the turf
Please do not question what you're worth
Yeah I got plans and I will scheme to fill each man with a light beam
I know you'll think that I'm extreme, I am fire know what I mean
And you will not need to redeem your coupon you are on my team
My heart is bustin' at the seam
Come on inside be in my dream
Word to the mothership
Yeah we're on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
We are divine create our life
Stopped eatin' swine took out the knife
Put in my back cause I got twice
Now that's a fact I payed a price
A little love it will suffice
I got the sass, sugar and spice
Gave you a pass now please be nice
Love everyone from men to mice
Word to the mothership
Yeah were on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit

"
75387,"

I got the fight inside
I have been crucified
I rose and now you'll ride
And stand right here beside
We'll all be friends real soon
We will get through the doom
Saw how much we consume
Put me in a white room
Gone crazy called a loon
Then something new to bloom
Sacred female in womb
Of earth she will come through

[Hook]
I'll be doing yoga
A secret sithe decoder
There's orbs up in my phota
A jedi taught by yoda

[Chorus 2x]
I know you like your god
But I still want you on my squad
I see the pain and facade
Even numbers need odd

[Verse 2]
And soon we all gonna fade to black
Ace of spades, then ya come right back
I'm gonna play please leave intact
You know if I lose we all get smacked
Took a new king gave up a jack
Found my new game in a backpack
Its fun to sum but its quite wack
People die of what they lack
We get high and spend our cash
Some die without food, you fast
Class is a problem, I see a caste
We create the now in the past
Law of attraction held from grasp
Of those that need to know the path
Creating love dispelling wrath
Master key holders create the facts

[Chorus 2x]

[Hook 2x]
My joy is yours lets date
I like you and think your great
Live love and just seal your fate
This is real, no mistake
(Rewind)

[Verse 3]
Unless you project your self hate
They burnt me at the stake
A goddess with good bait
I'll catch you, you just wait
Me you will not forgot
Cast spells I am a witch
And don't call me a bitch
Forget 'bout being rich
Desire it, got a glitch
Religion just like a snitch
Can often just make you twitch
Your the -ish now make a wish

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Wrote songs we'll before twenty (b420)
Had to create the money
You didn't know that dummy
Bite my head off its yummy
Chewin' me I am gummy
And then I feel real crummy
A knot inside my tummy
Want you to love me hunny
Hurt me I'll call the dunny
He'll paint you in the putty
Followin the white bunny
You fool time is not money
Time is a fiction sunny
My heart can't take it from me
Assume cause nose is runny
I do not think its funny

[Chorus 2x]

"
75388,"

Holding him closely
And it feels like I'll fall
My body is here mostly
And my soul heres the call
My gut is ghostly
But I gave it my all
My girls there getting toasty
But I'll bring them along
Say watcha want
Say watcha need
The time is now
It's the time indeed
Open your heart let your brain free
The way we'll start
Energy you'll bleed
You got my air
I'm your friend
Type me your vision and press send
I got your back
I can defend
There is no start
There is no end
The clock inside
Hold my redmpemptioon
And I'm very near to reach my ascention
I hope you understand
I have good intentions
And there's a road to hell that I will never mention
I am right here and now file for an extension
And we are all together now
There is no excp
To finish all my work
I steadily kept venting
I never benn very good at handling rejec
Depres ofton cause serious infection
She denied me twice
Kinda caused regression
And I was often scared of boys and erection
Wasn't bout my body, but my heart needed protection
Planning a take over
Universal intervention
We are all of earth
And she needs well respected
I will stop the virus
Please no more injection
And you do not know me
Please with the correction
Forgive me for so ofton not giving you attention
I will gladly listen now
Give me your suggestion
Create and heard from dust
Crystals hold the lesson
Ipf running for election
I am steadily building my collection
Of bad ass women seeking more than perfection
I am just liek you
You are my invention
Both sides of the mirror
We'll create reflection
Sometimes hard to funxtion
I feel a new something
Mans world assumption
Release all my judgement
We went out to lunch
We been right here punchin
Cause for injunxtion
And we all ben rushin
I been on my knees
I can hear the please of the poor and weak and I watch them bleed
Powers that be
Not saying please
Taken what they want not what they need
Wait for the signal
Frequency will mathc
Vibrat pivotal
I'm spinning to fast
My breath I'm slowing down
I hope this will last
We speak without talking
Third eye feels a blast
There's no time for sulking
It's been written and it shall pass
Asention I am stalking
I'm erasing all my wraith
Goodbye to my ego
I'm now on the path
My aura is pulsing
My palm shows my map

Meet me downtown
Rock it to the ground
Wiz he spread a sound
Boys in blue got shot down
Now we’re in a famous town
Buy another round drinking heavy giving pound
Purp n’ dunny stackin’ mounds
Steel was once our pride NYC built inside
A four rivers kinda mind
And now it’s our time
See we got mad rings, Yeah that’s my town
And we don’t need bling, spread it all around
And we making rockets to the moon we bound
Dj Hug and Bonics, they be getting it down
Got our stanley cups

Down at Shadow Lounge, we be doin’ the butt
Nak ladies strut, out the hybrid truck
Yeah the pirates, UHHH, but we still feel the funk
And we meditate
We’re daily feeling great
And we don’t take no breaks, and we are never fake

[Verse 2]
Robotic metropolis
Carnegie Mellon is shopping this
We build Manhattan here
But do not be scared my dear
Both sides of mirror are clear
Light workers are fighting fear
Fucking best and worst are here
Small pock curse in our stare
Killed the native Americans and in honor of them I will not swear again
Spirits are here and then
Also signed the first peace treaty
Some steel city suckas greedy
Laced and smoked and real seedy
Align the chi
Now the home of G20
Greenest city in the world, most livable
Meanest pity from a girl, shot down in critical
Got hospitals and jails
Saving folks and making bail
Center of Earth no pitch for sale
Down ya momz house singing scales
(Shani I love U!!!)
Only river going north
Other than the Nile
Mayans said with a kindly smile
The point of rivers will heal every child
Cleanse the sick from serious to mild
To a healing portal of power
A mere mortal who devourers
In our water take a shower
Our fruits will never sour
Elevated angle here in pistolvainia
It might strain ya
The paranoid stranger
See it as a danga' like we came from a manga'
A species not in danga' but Pittsburgh rearrange ya

Never saying never I'm a show you how
Your divine so am I bl bl bl blaow

[Chorus]

"
75391,
75392,"

Yeah I hate to tell ya but I won’t fit in your box
I know you wanna know but you cannot pick my locks
See you a part of me like New York is to the Bronx
And everything is everything we do not need to box
Cause I could stick and move, I am focused like a soldier
And you’ve been in my way, heavy like a boulder
And everybody’s scared of death and getting older
When you release your fear come cry on my shoulder
Cause, finally the Earth’s come around
Use a new part of your brain, make a new sound
All we want is love it’s making our heart pound
The new children are here they are coming out the ground
Stop medicating them their power will abound
Now please just gather round
The pitchers at the mound
Catch my words don’t clown
You know you like my sound
Now give your girl a pound or a hug would mean you’re down

[Hook 2x]
And with the power of Isis
I will speak to your third eye
I’ll be your soldier in crisis
I will lick your cheek when you cry

Down at the four rivers, the waters they will heal
I will lift my hands up to the sky and make it real
My bothers and my sisters, you will see how I feel
I will give you a dollar to listen, baby lets make a deal

No you can’t buy me
Don’t even try me
In fact unleash your lasso and please untie me
I’m done with the cowboys they do not excite me
Don’t need your opinions please don’t indicte me
I won’t do your homework, do not assign me
The universe will teach you what science is finding
Open up your chakras your aura could be blinding
Grab some rose quartz and start reminding

[Hook 2x]
And with the power of Isis
I will speak to your third eye
I’ll be your soldier in crisis
I will lick your cheek when you cry

I am a writing machine and this is my weapon
Fighting with my mouth peace I will be reppin’
We’re all contradictions stop your suggestin’
The righteous do not judge ‘cause they know its projectin’
And just ‘cause I say it’s the age of feminine
Doesn’t mean that I am not down for our men
We all need some yang get that dick up out your head
‘Cause there are mad women who are too masculine
And yes I know that I do not sound Caucasian
But sorry this is how it comes out like the days end
My soul is here for some consciousness raising
Stop all your labelin’ I’m Kellee amazin’
And I’m not concerned with which god you’re praising
Or what herb your blazing
Your light shines, its dazing and now the bridge fades in
And now the bridge fades in

Ladededadadadaday, you can light your own way
Ladededadadadaday, today can be your day
Ladededadadadaday I will be lighting my own way
Ladededadadadaday, today is my day

[Hook 4x]
And with the power of Isis
I will speak to your third eye
I’ll be your soldier in crisis
I will lick your cheek when you cry

"
75393,
75394,"

Feel the feminine coming through
Right brain active and you know what to do
I see a new light and it is turnin blue
My being will be all up inside of you

I write love of your taxes
I got some special tactics
The tools are sharp like cactus
I never been sued for mal practice
Do you like my accent
Its not real but fact is it took a lot of practice
Spinning off my axis
Landing their on venucs
You think i am a genius

Theres energy between us
You ask if i do mean this
My hands not on your penis
Ill fuck you in
Build it now machine is
Ill tell you we could dream this

Chorus

My poetry is thick

Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents
I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this

[Verse 1]
Justifiable rythym
Asking what you been missin’
Pimps so corporate n’ kissin
Values are tied in the lynching
All the fat needs some pinchin
Steady youth in a prison
No lovin’ supervision
There’s no cooks in the kitchen
Poison water no fishin’
All the sales men are pitchin’
To steal cause circumcision
Rape us continue snitchin’
Money drugs over bitches
I see something real different
I’ll be holdin’ a vision
It’s not just superstition

[Hook2x]
Something sacred sewed me sideways
I’m Mirrored, mimickin’ and movin’ my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

[Verse 2]
I’m fighting my ego
I think may be it’s sequel
Is opposite of evil
Sugar fucked up my equal
Never researched the prequel
Toxins all in your fecal
Poppin’ pills swelling measle
Tell me where is my people
They don’t bow at no steeple
Lightworkers gettin deepa
Quantum physics’ll teach ya
My lyrics they might reach ya
Read the poems I preach ya
This full length is my feature
A mysterious creature
We are one blood all keepers

[Hook2x]
Something sacred sewed me sideways
I’m Mirrored, mimickin’ and movin’ my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

[Verse 3]
My spaceship is leavin’
Out the window I’m seein’
End of left brain per diem
Psychics say they can see them
Daddy’s fightin my demons
Beside me steady dreamin
That he helps me make freedom
From the grave he is screamin
F! the man and his semen
Kinda fishy no reason
Corporation is reakin’
Smells of workers well treated
Earth mother she is fienin’
For a break in the season
Discontent no one pleasin’
Called a cunt that is bleedin’

[Hook2x]
Something sacred sewed me sideways
I’m Mirrored, mimickin’ and movin’ my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

King tutt
U like the new frequency
U wanna feel it come with me
Think about it revolution
Do not doubt it this is our evolution
Yes I'm angry and bitter and often hear screams
See the people who struggle and I'm scared of these things
Nuclear weapons, corruption famine and poisoned steams
And if we don't change our ways it's what tomorrow brings
Revolving door has opened
I know u scared a choken
But u have my token
I promise I'm not joken
And some they will be smokin
But my third eye'll be open
I am no longer hoping
I'm creating worlds with focus
U like the new frequency
U wanna feel it come with me
Think about it revolution
Do not doubt it this is our evolution
A new kinda herb
It runs through your veins
Your head it will turn
In new kinda ways
Ull think I'm absurd
But I felt the rays
Don't need your concern
Just hear what I say
Indigenous people
They knew this all along
We bowed cash and steeple
Consumers doing wrong
But you can feel it now
Life is yours to create
Your heart can heal and wow
If you just concentrate
Now You can walk calm
Or bounce with me strut
This is a new psalm
Jesus and king tutt
The lines in my palm
They say you'll get stuck
Repeating my songs
And I don't give a f*ck
Cause this is not bout you
And it's not about me
It's about the world baby
And how we set it free
The clock is almost there
Linear time is ending
No sense in being scared
Postive vibes need sending

“Mad Humans” Remix
Written by Kellee Maize
Produced by J. Glaze

[Verse 1]
The maker of collective destruction
Choose to attend the devil’s luncheon
See the woman as a body with one function
Not open to discussion or any kind of trusting
Boil it down to substance
Well we got nothing of something
Awful disgusting
The theory’s been pussing and bleeding
Only worried about the hairline receding
Deceiving the masses
Their Facebook status
Would read
Here I am pleasing all these elite asses
Time to go to dynamic from the static
While the women walk miles to get water
And then leading all the sheep to the slaughter
Mother Earth is getting hotter, we forgot her
And now she’s pissed and igniting her daughters
Who will, lead you to a new kind of life
Fulfill, Help us take the path that’s right
No kill Nurture your feminine side
Love you despite who made you cry
And who let you die, we forgive you
With a sigh but please don’t deny
All the slaves that helped you build this
All the women that gave your kids a kiss
Bow down 4X

[Chorus 3X]
This is it, bow down
You must quit, right now

[Verse 2]
I’m not saying no men will lead
There are many in power that we need
To be wayshowers to the light
Show us they nurtured, the feminine sight
Cause something has not been right
You can feel even if you ain’t been paying no attention
It shows up and everything you mention and feel
You are an extension of what is real
Of collective consciousness, invention
We planned this now time for intention
How’s that for indigestion
Now let me deal and make a suggestion
To clean the wounds that have been festering
Forgive all who you won’t mention
And who you hate
Forgive the wrongdoers and fakes
Send love to every soul from pole to pole
City to city, mother to son, and young to old
No need to for pity, we are all one
Break out this mold, give back what you stole
Admit it when you lie, it’s burying you inside
Be willing to be wrong
Stop worrying about looking good
You don’t have to be strong
Or be hurrying, to be what you think you should
You are whole, perfect, strong, powerful
Reflect that in the world and you will live long, loving, harmonious, and happy
It’s stunning when all of us are sappy
Full of passion and lacking greed
But still human yet perfect indeed
But when we admit our downfall
Suddenly we feel that we belong
To a universal force that holds you up
Keeps you on course with no remorse
I honor each of you for all your darkness and your light
And the integration can now begin
This night
Bow down 13X

[Chorus 2X]
This is it, bow down
You must quit, right now

Yeah.. sendin this one out.. to all the ladies and my girls at nakturnal
Grab your journal.. its eternal..
See if you feel this..

[Verse 1]
The fear isnt out there, no ma its just love
We co-create this pain inside forever
Oh please, hu be’s, just take a look
A life can change from a person story or book
You hooked, cause ain't no such thing as halfway lifted
The spirits around when the crown opens expansive sound
It's similar in shaman law
Now we all float up and fold, and beyond, we in control
They better have the gemstones ready
Settin the babies free and our third eye steady
Hand healing is subtle, we touch you
Cells expand no bs to go home wit
My aura is thick, cause I be up in the mix of rapture
Enlightenment, this is what im after
The hate got a girl depressed
Wish my ether was armor to absorb the stress
God bless ur soul, the hematite is laid searching for the scroll
Holy grail quilt, the feminine re-enter
Two skills to one, put us together
It's like mixin citrine and guilt
Duality is lastin, takin my enemies with me
And all the outkasted I will never regret see
Goddess lives in me, retracted, and some confuse it as an act
We’ve risen now we can’t turn back
This is the fact, quantum physics is my crack
That can't say no, I will release the slack
Take a breath thank the goddess ur alive
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive

[Hook]
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth

[Verse 2]
Im zapped in the vortex I melt
Go with the flow you know when the flow gets low
His feathers go, remember that
As long as you don’t have my back
I’ll be on the clock hustlin’ recording a track
Reroute my team in tact and proceed exhausted
But certain payout more than the cost and
Its written the new world order, forget it, your smitten
My mother gave up spent a lot of time wishin
Mayan 5th world is my new sale pitchin
Ask my fam when I separated, alien fits in
But shit happens for a reason
No sense in holdin me down its really u
That your fist squeezin
Science now explains how your higher self tickle
Hit with a 528 hertz occult
Take responsibility and stop all the blame
No need to shoot bigger than me
Forget the fame
The point is set to tip the hundredth monkey real quick
Only a few, absorbin all your prejudice
Full affect don’t forget ain’t done yet
No matter how much love I get
Im making freedom my project, forever
Not givin up until it gets better
Indeed self improve and then we get together
When babies in the hearse, something just don’t work
Try not to react to silly shit and let my feelins hurt
My crews all about truth, we still cute
And quickly see to inner beauty root
Beyond self, on the track, stood up when I feel
In the city of bridges the portal opens well
You better realize

[Hook]
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth sun we will survive
Keep givin love till the day that we die
Revival of the fifth

Yesterday is not today, ill let the memories fade away
I gotta keep keep moving on, i had the power all along

I know that i might seem naive
But look deep and you'll see my tree
I've been learning every day
Been working hard with little play

Oh thanks for all the negativity
See thats why i don't watch tv

Yesterday is not today, ill let the memories fade away
I gotta keep keep moving on, i had the power all along

The start die before we see
I was that before i was me
Im pulsing lonely in my field of gray
Digital bearings program my day

Unfold my mirrors and see on thru
Discuss it all in terms of you
Bleeding hands reveal my love
I am seeking all the meaning from above

Yesterday is not today, ill let the memories fade away
I gotta keep keep moving on, i had the power all along

I think that i can find a light
Fuck the weak folks who won't fight
We gotta stand up and take whats ours
Show the youth how to reach for the stars
Ill take my space ship strait to mars
And you can chill in those corporate bars
But i would love some company
So hows about you joining me
In fact you can steer baby
And bring the others and we will all be free
Cause if im secluded
Then your alone
Im slowely torn from my thrown
Wasted visions of purity
Salvation isn't found in the majority
Collect my values in my purse
I bore my soul with each new verse

You may not know me
But I know you
And I’m aware how strange that sounds
Y’see, we cross paths
Every Thursday at 2
Goin’ to class to make ya mama proud

I ain’t the type’a guy
You’d usually hang around
Baby, I got potential
It’s in due time
So let’s not waste now

Come and skip class with me
I’ll take ya to the wrong side of the street
Take ya down to the places your mama calls “hood”
The same places I call home and spent childhood
Where time seems to slow down- slow down
Until you can feel the earth beneath you goin’ round and round
I can see the crazy in your eyes growin’ brighter
With every word that flies from my mouth

And I know, this may sound irrational, but
You can’t go wrong livin’ by the motto

[Chorus]
You can always retake the class
But you can’t relive the party
You can always retake the class
But you can’t relive the party

I seen them other guys that you keep tame
And in steady control like your hair and your GPA
It’s a shame you were never the one
To ride your bike no-hands in the summer just coastin’
Tell me the last time you smiled just because
Somethin’ happened without you havin’ planned it
Yeah- Girl, it’s time to let go and let the handle bars do the dancin’

[Chorus]

Look hurr little bookworm
We doin’ this or not? Click “deny” or “confirm”
I know ya think I’m just kickin’ hype prose
Like the rest’a them Ghastons and Federline Jones’
But I ain’t got all the time in the free world
To be hollerin’ at just any library girl
Struck me like a Scott Hall dropkick
NWO- the new young hotness

I only make moves on a whim
Let’s take this road trip to the middle of Wisconsin-
California- even New Orleans
Party ‘til dawn, wake up and watch adult swim
Oh, you were headed to the bookstore?
‘Bout to drop a couple hundred on text books?
Ma, we could flip that money two-fold
Throw a house party, charge 5 for the keg cups

You rep honor roll, I rep Delta Chi
You say “dope fresh”, I say “hella fly”
Baby, we’re isotopes, different nuclei
On the same table, forever livin’ by

[Chorus]

"

Rain, rain, won’t you stay
I never really cared for when the skies were blue
I’d rather have you than snow today
Oh, rain, rain, won’t you stay
I never really cared for when the skies were blue
I’d rather have you than snow today

My turn signal blinks when I turn left or right
Almost in sync with my flashin’ engine light
It could be worse, I could be cursed
To steerin’ old habits rollin’ on stolen bikes
To be workin’ with an organ with less than golden pipes
To be headed nowhere with a head full of hopeful hype
I’m not the man you’d settle for
Who could only maintain a crush on the girl from the liquor store

For rich or poor, hittin’ the deck or jumpin’ over board
We sadly volunteer for the happy in-between
And I’ve been floatin’ off the course and haven’t seen the shore
Ever since I cut the anchor and decided this was me
So spill, did you choose- is this you?
Beautiful and uptight tryin’ to keep grad school cool?
Payin’ off the debt behind a desk slangin’ booze
Waitin’ on someday… hmm
-
Chorus
Frozen just before closin’
I couldn’t help but notice
You gave a small smile
Knowin’ tonight might be different
Than bright lights and liquor
Ya look out the window and sigh

Rain, rain, won’t you stay
I never really cared for when the skies were blue
I’d rather have you than snow today
Oh, rain, rain, won’t you stay
I never really cared for when the skies were blue
I’d rather have you than snow today
-
I have dreams, but I wake up on a couch
Or in my car, or the floor of someone else’s house
It could be worse, I could be cursed
Sleepin’ on cardboard, laughin’ at the clouds
This tough lover’s crush ain’t the slightest odd
It’s an invite to spray paint the town when you get off your job
So, before you buckle underneath your hopes to keep’em up
Find a black dress, the night is lookin’ mighty Neil Young

Meet me on the corner at the center of the city
Where tomorrow ain’t a promise and it’s only good as iffy
We’ll show the buildings and graffiti what they’re missin’
And give’em a little bit’a the venom and good heavens
Since “I like you” hasn’t been enough
Here’s a full heart, gold coin and a one-up
Where I’m from, goin’ vulnerable is playin’ smart
Lights out, let’s give this thing a jumpstart

Chorus

You’re tired of the same
Well, right on, right on, right on, right on right on
You’re tired of the same
Well, right on, right on, right on, right on, right on
I could be your change
Right on, right on, right on, right on, right on
I could be your change

Chorus

And so it starts; it’s like the old days
Step up on the scene and hear the glass break
Used to be concerned about the cash wait
Wake up in the morning wipe the cole out my eye
Told my momma church is boring they too old to be fly
I made her mad an ill steeze still she packing my lunch
Paper bagged some grilled cheese, couple crackers and punch
I was trusting in the fools what decision I survive it
Went to public school but see they kept religion private
Intimate as I get
Navigate my soul from inner demons like a pilot
My momma fighting cancer
Think the lord is calling me it’s about that time I answer
Pick up on the other line now that would be nice
To switch up my life
Side of mercy that could suffice
The passion of Christ, nodded then he looked at me twice
The pastor told me Jesus probably got his hands on my life
Thank God for my wife, supporting, really that’s important
Greet me in the morning meet me by the river Jordan yeah
I’m from the planet of Queens with wise apparel
Keep the eyes up on the sparrow see the crooked paths narrow
It’s clearly, fortified to hear me
Mortify the flesh and die to sin sincerely
Signed sealed delivered see the cross is a perk
No loss in the work, cruising like a Porsche in the church
Of course it could work
Put you in the dirt and you solo
The horse on my shirt
Guess it’s Ralph Lauren or Polo, yeah
But materialism it doesn’t too
Seek ye first the kingdom of God it’s added unto you
So tell me what you want to do
My faith will move a mountain no doubt and maybe one or two
And so the church gets labeled as wanting cheap thrills
When they radio and debating with um a Meek Mill’s
That’s how deceit feels, when they only peep skills
And nobody be listening to what the artist has to say
A bunch of nothing, sex murder death homicide
And everybody’s a killer they screaming I’m a ride
It’s like the days are strange and everything is odd
Let’s take it back to the basics all praise God

[Verse 1: K. Sparks]
Smooth with it, Now show em what you do with it
But I'm on again, and I'm born to win, Won't really chatter but I'm born in sin, Don't really matter but I'm born again
Got the fader, Back and forth like hot potato, Rep the cross and God is greater, Seconds loss and lots of data
Born up in a manger, Caught up in the danger
Everybody wanna get a hit like a pager
Blow the path and you'll see that danger
Slow to wrath and don't feel that anger
Anger me, Change will be, Mean to fight internal wars
If the grass looks greener on the other side then water yours
But of course, I was loss, like my momma then he found her
Comma drama tell Obama God we trust in no Osama
Use to spend our time getting twisted in a red civic
God convert the mind and now we resurrect the dead with it
Cat kicks the mouse, The mouse kicks the cheese
But up in God's house see we all live with ease

[Hook: Scratches]
All right, All right, Up into the heavens, Make you catch the spirit, Up into the heavens

[Verse 2: K. Sparks]
Smooth with it though, Now show em what you do with it, Being but a rival, Keen for survival, Eyes on the Lord better read that Bible, Being that I'm vital, Back of the lack, But I move and improve but I get that vital
Vital, Vital, Gotta get you well immunizations
Assuming like a hospital waiting room God is patient
This be the, Last days they be deceiving you to blast off
Food ain't good enough they wanna eat you too, Bath salts
It's no offending me, Energy to my enemy, Simile like a chimney, Holy just like the trinity, Homie it's like it's ten of me, Phony just like the enemy, The flesh is weak, Bless the beat, God is strong, Word is bond
I'm from the planet of Queens New York City
Street prophet urban disciple we so gritty
Cat kicks the mouse, The mouse kicks the cheese
But up in God's house see we all live with ease

[Hook: Scratches]
All right, Up into the heavens, Make you catch the spirit, Alright, Up into the heavens

[Verse 1: K. Sparks]
And I'm a let it breathe, It's so easy
It's harder when you going through it see they hate how
Weeping endureth for the night but see I'm wake now
Rappers sound the same nobody different less drastic
You in the same lane as the rest expect traffic
Scrutinize my income, Take it all and then some
Like a older prince with a dunce hat the Kingdom
Is what I do it for, Blatantly peruse it raw
Part of me for artistry and pardon me but who are ya'll
It's worse to break but no harming me
This album be my best to date, No eHarmony
Survival it pays whatever goes in
The Bible says that many are called but few are chosen
Sleep behind the wheel and people Dozing
The last shall be first but please it's like a omen

[Hook: K. Sparks]
Say you gotta take ya time, Say Say you gotta free ya mind
Say we got a way to go, Say Say we gotta way to go, Way to go
Say you gotta take ya time, Say you gotta free ya mind
Say we got a way to go, Say Say we gotta way to go, Way to go

[Verse 2: K. Sparks]
I never trip see it's like I'm in a wheelchair
Robo Cop tryna get a cut, Still here
I was stressed like how bad can bad get
Mad yet, Friends bounced on me like a bad check
Dag get, Drag net, Cinematic versatile
God flow I know, Getting personal
Mother of my seed and my child, Taking care of those
Christ walked on water the style I need a pair of those
Size nine, I grind, Break em in properly
They blind, Christ shine, To give em sight properly
Living in the last days, Sinning with out fast ways
Killing quick to blast strays, Prison where the black stays
Racism trying to keep our people Isolated
Faith'll move a mountain homie maybe twice I made it
Sleep behind the wheel and people Dozing
The last shall be first please believe it like a omen

[Hook: K. Sparks]

Thanks for picking up my broken teeth
I spit 'em out 'cause I can't swallow anything
Mouthwash is pumping through my veins
Just to help me get me on my feet and clean again

Coming straight out of your mouth
And into the ground
Coming straight out of your mouth
And into the ground

Taste the flavor I'll be taking pains
To do the things I gotta do to be the same
I don't feel the way I think I seem
Maybe I can work it out in surgery

Coming straight out of your mouth
And into the ground
Coming straight out of your mouth
And into the ground

It's the same thing out of your mouth
A little fluoride
It's the same thing out of your mouth
A little fluoride
It's the same thing out of your mouth
A little fluoride
It's the same thing out of your mouth
A little fluoride

It was a lousy deal on both our parts
You begged me a body and I raised you heart
But you foiled my plan when you caught my bluff
I got a decent hand but is it good enough to win
I had it figured out til you dealt me in
Cuz I’d set my sights on a one night stand
Had an appetite for a handsome man
And you had all clout of a season flirt
I said “Hey! Cut it out, before someone gets hurt.”
I knew a night is not enough to get enough of you
Oh Oh that first kiss
My gambling days are gonna end like this
Never want enough to fill my tank
But that first was money in the bank
Oh money in the bank
Now the stakes are high and I’m sweating cold
I got a losing hand but I’m too proud to fold
Got a poker face, I’m made of steely stuff
I can lose with grace, but am I strong enough for this?
You know the odds were laid when you played that kiss
Oh Oh that first kiss
My gambling days are gonna end like this
Never want enough to fill my tank
But that first kiss was money in the bank
Oh money in the bank
Come and get in bed with me and take off all your clothes
You can quit your job and I can cancel all my shows
Cuz I have played a lot of hands and I’ve never lost a one
But still I go home lonely when the game is done
So I don’t mind to losing if it’s you who’s won
Oh Oh that first kiss
My gambling days are gonna end like this
Never want enough to fill my tank
But that kiss was money in the bank
That first kiss was money in the bank
That first kiss was money in the bank
Oh money in the bank

He got a frame like a busted bike
He got a face that nobody likes to see
Nobody but me
He got a thing or two to learn about love
He act like he ain’t never heard of romance
So why’d I give him a chance?
My baby can dance
My baby can swing
My baby can shake me slow
So I don’t need no other thing
My baby can dance
My baby can sway
My baby can hold me tight enough
To drive my cares away
We go out to the joint downtown
I dress up and he dress down but it
Don’t matter one bit
Cus we got something better than class
Who needs love when love don’t last that long?
And all we need is a song
My baby can dance
My baby can groove
My baby can shut me up
So I listen to the music and move
My baby can dance
My baby can sway
My baby can hold me tight enough
To drive my cares away
My baby can dance

[Verse 1]

We measured the distance
Of the space between the islands
Gazing out into the river Styx, she said
""It's no river at all, it's a tidal estuary,""
Was her only line, she delivered it well

Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells

[Verse 2]

They called it the pyrex age
The glass dawn of our thought process
Later to be chronicled in violent history books
“You suffer” on karaoke
Cause there was no English translation for hell

Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells

Two young fingers in wet cement
There's a new impression built in front of my apartment
BG & EE that's so sweet
I wonder what E's gonna say when she sees

It's a pretty far walk to the DMV

Storm chasin' hippies at a discount mall
Megaphone muppet poster on the wall
Speaking in stones like we've never heard before
You take the risk, I'll get the reward

I don't know too much I just got the keys

There's billionaire buses on my unlit street
Hey who's that walkin' up? That looks like E
Let's hide in the bushes so that we can hear her say
""Who would build a monument for me anyway?""

That's B! BG! He'll build it for you babe
You know BG, he'll give you what you need

What could I even say to you Rene?
I could stop reacting then
I'd be acting like your fool because
What could I even say to you Rene?
I could follow you but then you'd never see me
Right behind you

I went to a shrink
And he found my brain
And I had no ideas is what he found
[x2]
No ideas is what he found
No ideas

What could I even say to you Rene?
I could meditate and sleep all day but
I'd never know what the first step to take was
What could I even say to you Rene?
Are we candles or are we wax and
With facts like that I'll never know how to relax

And I had no ideas is what he found

I was feeling nostalgic for the days when
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling
I remember the feeling of the muse less existence
Of the drunk, bored and listless
Endless waiting for something that I knew wasn't coming

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this

I was up to my neck in motivation neglect when
I felt soft waves of purpose crashing onto the surface
I was feeling nostalgic for the days when
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling
I remember the feeling

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time

Seems these days I'm captive in this

Twice an era comes a knock at my door
Suspended in a window-crashing gaze of a poor
Spark of recognition, it's the thrill that dies first but
I can think of something worse: the curse, because

Light up gold
Was the colour of something I
Was looking for
[x2]

Steady was the pace kept in that tear-leaking sway
Sifting like a miner in the conscience debris
Hunched down, gleaning embers from a burning field
Trying to find something warm and real because

Light up gold
Was the colour of something I
Was looking for

She gets on her banana bike and pedals all around
She gets on her banana bike and travels through the town
There's just no stopping her, this is for sure
She gets on her banana bike and pedals more and more

She meets up with her friends and goes and goes and goes
Where's her destination? Sometimes no one knows
She disappears for days on end
Is she by herself or is she with a friend?

Banana bike, banana bike
Banana bike, banana bike

She keeps us guessing, always on her toes
When is she gonna get on that banana bike?
(Where is she gonna go?)

Banana bike, banana bike
Banana bike, banana bike

Banana bike, banana bike
Banana bike, banana bike

She doesn't need to worry about the price of gas
But she needs to worry about going around corners too fast

She and her banana bike are always on the go
But there is one thing she really needs to know
Helen and her banana bike
We love you so

I wish I were a performer
And you were my fan
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

If you thought I was smart
If you thought I was neat
It would melt my heart
And make it skip a beat

If I had famous parents, would you pay attention
To every word I say?
I'd know you were lyin', it would leave me cryin'
I hope you know that's not the way to do things

I know it's hard to love a person who can't really see
But don't get discouraged, it doesn't have to be
I wish I had superpowers, how nice that would be
I'd make other girls invisible, so you'd have to look at me

I'd be drop-dead gorgeous (I'd be drop-dead gorgeous)
That you couldn't stand (That you couldn't stand)
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

If I had lots of money, would you think I'm funny
And laugh at every joke I tell?
I don't think I'd like it when you go ""ha ha ha""
You're going straight to H-E-L-L-O, goodbye

I wish I were a performer
And you were my fan
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

'Cause I know you don't love me
But I think you can
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

The boy that lives next door to me
Sees me walking down the street
But he don't look, he don't speak
He don't even notice me

Even though he does all these things
He's still my cutie, my cutie

Every day it's the same, every night there's no change
He lives so close, and yet we're so far away (Away, away)
Maybe it'll all be different someday (Someday, someday)
Maybe it'll all be different someday

Even though he don't smile
He don't think
He don't even think of me
He's still my cutie, my cutie

I don't know why he don't look
I don't know why he don't speak
I don't know why he won't even notice me
But that's okay, I don't mind
He will always be my cutie
No matter what he does
No matter what he says
He's my cutie

You know I love you, oh yes, I do
And I do think that it's true
That you really love me too
But you say no and I say boo hoo

You say you've met somebody new
That you're in love, and I ask who
Then you tell me and I get blue
'Cause it's not fair, so I say boo hoo
'Cause it's a boo-boo

And I thought you thought we were meant to be
I guess that person turned out to be she
Who really matters

You know I think that you're being cruel
Some would say that you are a fool
But I know that one day you'll
Have somebody to make you say boo hoo

And you thought I thought that I would be so sad
But as it turns out, I am really so glad
You don't really matter

You know I loved you, that was true
But I'm happy that we're through
I have better things to do
Than sit at home and sayin' boo hoo

Sayin' boo hoo
Sayin' boo hoo (Sayin' boo hoo)
Sayin' boo hoo (Sayin' boo hoo, boo hoo)
Sayin' boo hoo (Sayin' boo hoo, boo hoo)

Faster and faster, I go by the minute
Hotter and hotter, I almost did it
Stoplight won't stop me, it won't inhibit
I'm not going the speed limit

The limit, the speed limit
The limit

I'm here for a second, gone in a flash
Can't stay too long, I have to dash
Heading for trouble, heading for a crash
Watch out, watch out!
Whoo, I missed it by one eyelash

The limit, the speed limit
The limit, the speed limit
The limit (The limit), the speed limit

Fly by cars and trucks with ease
Head low and in a breeze
Race the racin' in my heart
Ready, get, go!

Hand on the bars, feet on the pedal
Goin' so fast I should get a medal
My blood is pumpin', boilin' like a kettle
But I'll never stop (No!) I'll never settle

On a limit, a speed limit
A limit, a speed limit
A limit (A limit), a speed limit
A limit (A limit), a speed limit

I won't shed a tear (A limit)
When I kick it into high gear (A limit)
So don't get too near (A limit)
I'm happy when you're clear

Ainda não percebi em que dia alterei o percurso da história
Em que momento mudei e me afundei nesta casa ilusória
Quando matei o meu nome e inventei esta persona
Que me salvou mas me condenou à existência inglória
Em criança eu pensava que era normal em tudo
Mas assustava-me não conseguir ver para o futuro
Hoje apercebo-me da explicação desse tumulto
Por muito que envelheça nunca me vou tornar adulto
Recuso-me a aceitar que a idade me feche num casulo
A minha mãe sofre e eu sei que é por causa disto
Ela revê-se em mim mas odeia quando insisto
Que foi dela que herdei a demência e o desequilíbrio
Com o meu pai nunca me consegui relacionar bem
Ele tem bom coração e ele sabe que eu sei
Mas nunca conversamos porque eu sempre rejeitei
Deixar qualquer um deles perceber o que já passei
Os meus amigos dizem que eu não sou normal
Mas há algo que me impede dessa aproximação pessoal
Um dia vou-lhes escrever uma carta, não, um livro
Explicar-lhes de uma só vez o porquê de nunca lhes ter dito
O que me ocupa, o que sou, quem conheço, onde vivo
E pedir-lhes que o queimem depois de o terem lido
O meu irmão tem uma tolerância excepcional comigo
Acho que ele conhece o demónio que me corrói desde menino
Só percebi muito mais tarde o quão era esquisito
Ir para a rua mas preferir brincar sozinho
Falar com os cães e acreditar ser ouvido
E achar que os 8 bits eram iguais ao mundo fisico
Quando fui para a escola..foi um choque
Estar na sala de aula era como estar num caixote
Era inteligente, tinha boas notas
Mas não percebia porque é que não podia descalçar as botas
Na quarta classe chegou à turma uma miúda nova
Excluída à partida, apaixonei-me pela fora de norma
E esse amor na génese nunca mudou até agora
Não há desgosto que normalize a direcção da minha seta
Uma vez parti um braço quando caí da bicicleta
Só levei uma reguada, uma vez andei à porrada
Uma vez a minha mãe fingiu que me abandonou na estrada
Fiz exércitos e exércitos de bonecos de plasticina
Nunca fui de férias de Verão mas fui de férias da vida
Quatro anos de depressão sem sair de casa de dia
Já recuperei mas a noite ainda me suspira
Dos anos antes de ti só tenho memórias fugidias
Descobri a má vida, viciei-me na cafeína
Estive em belas artes onde nunca me senti artista
O que só me confirmou aquilo que eu já sabia
Ensinam-se conhecimentos mas arte não se ensina!

As luzes estão apagadas, o silêncio paralisa
Este sufoco nega-me sede, o silêncio arrepia
As lâmpadas estão partidas e eu grito em surdina
Nesta Caixa de Vidro, respiro asfixia

As luzes estão apagadas, o silêncio paralisa
Este sufoco nega-me sede, o silêncio arrepia
As lâmpadas estão partidas e eu grito em surdina
Nesta Caixa de Vidro, respirei toda a vida...

I look at you, you look at me
Our hearts surge with feeling cause we agree
How the Spirit fills this moment
Holding us together in a bond of love
Such a mystery
Like a window looking out into eternity
But even though this feels like heaven
We know that it is just...

The edge of the dream
The start of the plan
It's the way we begin to understand
The endless stream
The depths of His love
We got a long way to go
But the thrill is to know
It's just the edge of the dream

Feel the strength, the tenderness
He's given us a glimpse of His Holiness
As our souls flow together
Let us step on over...

The edge of the dream
Into the heart of His plan
It's the way we begin to understand
The endless stream
The depths of His love
We got a long way to go
But the truth we must know

Lord we must search for Your wisdom
We went to live as Your children
And move closer, closer, closer
To the dream

Moving backwards
Don’t know how to feel this time again
Will you be alright my friend
Captivated what went wrong I don’t know anything
Need to go outside again

(Pre-Chorus)
Why’d I step outside
Why’d I step outside
Why’d I step outside
Why’d I step outside

(Chorus)
It makes me feel like I’m no one
It makes me feel like I’m the one

(Verse 2)
Started seeing dreams
Reality constructs itself again
Need to step outside my friend
Trying to cool down
But you give yourself a fright
Trying to sleep right now alright

(Pre-Chorus)
Why’d I step outside
Why’d I step outside
Why’d I step outside
Why’d I step outside

(Chorus)
It makes me feel like I’m no one
It makes me feel like I’m the one

(Verse 3)
But when I walk around all I see is stupid frowns now
And when I walk around all I see is stupid frowns now
And when I walk around all I see is stupid frowns now

Are you tired? Is your confidence shaken?
Is life a mystery to you?
Are you stumbling around without clues?
Well, take heart
Even though you are weary and worn
Clear to the bone
Just remember that you're not alone
You just hold on, don't be afraid
You just hold on to the Promised One
You just hold on, don't be dismayed
He'll never let you down
You better hold on, you have been chosen
Just hold on to the Promised one
You better hold on
Believe in the Lord of love
When it seems that the trials and
Troubles of life are larger than you
Follow Him, He will see you through
Don't be ashamed
When your soul is weak
Just believe in the one you seek
The God of truth won't betray you

Where will you go
When the sun goes out?
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?

[Verse 1]
I know my dreams will comfort me
In times when no one's there to see
The words that fill my mind
Telling what’s behind
The eyes of a fool

[Chorus]
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?

[Verse 2]
My dreams are mystery to me
In nighttime dwell I want to be
I don't care what people say
Sleeping is a getaway
From life as a fool

[Chorus]
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?

"
81083,
81084,
81085,"

Summer days are at my door
It won't be like before
The wind blows softly through my room

Summer dreams are in the air
Some place but I don't know where
I feel I'll find her pretty soon

Memories keep rushing by
And I always wonder why
I've got to make myself believe

Things will always be the same
All I'll play is a summer's game
Golden sunlight at the sea

"
81086,"

All the lights are flashing by
I'm hiding in my dream
Am I the only one with all these questions in my brain
I try to close my eyes
Until the answer came
I want to float away
But all these clouds just look the same

Are my dreams really gone like the girl with golden hair?
I'm always wondering
Are you really there?
You walk behind the hallways
Following my steps
It's right in front of me
But you know the way back

I'm a chameleon
I'm changing everyday
I'm sitting in my dream
Not sure where I will stay

All the stars are shining bright
I'm swimming in the deep
Please tell me where I stand or forever I will sleep
He doesn't seem to realize it's there
In the darkness down below he sits and stares

And all the colours you'll see wide and you'll get blind
You're always there to ask me questions in my mind
He doesn't seem to realize it's there
In the darkness down below he sits and stares

'm a chameleon
I'm changing everyday
I'm sitting in my dream
Not sure where I will stay

"
81087,"

The world goes crazy for a while
I'd been waiting hours for her smile
I just need to wake up to find
That my troubles are all making me blind

Oooooo
Aaaaaaa

I sometimes got the feeling that I'm locked inside again
And I've got to win before my world will go insane
I play against the stormy night and thunder in the sky
And I don't know the ending for the smoke inside my eyes

Puppets dangling on golden strings
Her controlled by many things
Pushed around by heavy winds
Trees stand tall and start to sing

(ALL X2)

"
81088,"

Sitting by the old road again
Waiting for a letter for a friend
Thinking 'bout the old days again
Drifting down a river with no end

But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me
But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me

Passing by the cave on the cove
Standing in the darkness in the sun
Open up the window to your mind
So I can look inside and lend a hand

But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me
But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me

Am I the one eyed king amongst the blind
Can I heal the wounds that leave behind
Let me be the saviour of your mind
For the army of emotions I command

"
81089,"

When we are to meet again
This feeling's just the same
Every time your presence seems enough to change my name

Is it best to clear the air
Of sunshine for a while
Wouldn't it be better if the sunshine made you smile?

I can't see you
I would like to
Clear the air
It's not fair

Time will tell what happens if
The flowers disappear
If darkness holds til we will meet
Each other every year

It's alright if you take your time
Love will find its place in line
Just kill this mood or we'll be grey
After all that was has died away

I can't see you
I would like to
Clear the air
It's not fair
(x3)

[Verse 1: Jacco Gardner]
Little Jane came home last night
Just before the velvet light of morning

Shes been gone for many hours in the garden
Picking flowers for her love

[Chorus]
Every time
She comes home
No one's there
All alone

[Verse 2: Jacco Gardner]
No one comes to find her there
You can try but be aware
She's been waiting every day for her Mr. Right to come and stay

Little Jane sits in the shadows waiting, looking out the window for her love
She might have to wait forever on her own because he's never at the door
(Ahhhh ahhhhhh ahhhh ahhhhhhhh)

[Chorus]
Every time
She comes home
No one's there
All alone

[Verse 3: Jacco Gardner]
No one comes to find her there
You can try but be aware
She's been waiting every day for her Mr. Right to come and stay

No one come to find here there
You can try but be aware
Do you really love her so?
When your there shell never let you go
(Ahhhh ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh)

This is the year that you dream about
When it all comes out
And we are done
Picture the faces in a roundabout
Can you take it?
Oh no no no

It's in our hands
We make our own plans
You fall now
Face it, I will too

It's up to you to make it happen
To see it through
Just bow your head and I will too

We traveled
Starry-eyed
Up to the edge
And then you turned
And left me there for dead

And later
When I won you over again
Oh I burned you back in the end

It's in our hands
We make our own plans
You fall now
Maybe I will too
It's up to you to make it happen
To see it through
Just bow your head and I will too

Oh I'll keep a candle lit for you!
So it is written
You were good to me
And to your family
Who will I be?
And should we ever get it back again
Can we make it up here, my friend?
It's in our hands
If this is goodbye
You go your way and I will too
It's up to you
To say I'm sorry
And then I love you
Just bow your head little darling
Come on, your girl is calling
Just bow your head and I will too

I'm so glad
It's gonna be fine

I learned my lessons from a real good kind
They said
Be helpful and be on time
And you can be happy for the rest of your life

I broke down when I was traveling alone
A little lady took me into her home
She said, ""You're OK""
I think I have what you need
I learned my lessons from a real good breed
They said, ""Be gracious
And be real kind, and tread lightly on the land that you find""

When you can, you try to be on time
And you can be happy for the rest of your life

Do what you love
And what you believe in

I learned my manners from a real good team
They said, ""when you have to, you change your ways
And you'll be healthy for the rest of your days
So be thankful and speak your mind
Give love to the treasures you find
When you can, try to be on time
And you'll be happy for the rest of your life.""

I had a similar dream
My dream was real though
I left my body in the bed
I took my clutch and pipe
Climbed out the window
And I was something else instead
Automechanic
I never worry
I have a garden and a radio
Made all my own tools
Minding my business
Trade you a tune for some gasoline
Out in the country I met a good man
Found my body in the bed
We traveled far and wide
In some of my favorite rides
Working on engines and making them run again
Now I'm a farmer
Praying for rain
But we have the children and the radio
Made all my own tools
Minding my business
Trade you a tune for some gasoline
Automechanic
I never worry
I have a garden and a radio
Automechanic
I never worry
I have a garden and the radio
Made all my own tools
Yeah, I can machine
Trade you a tune for some gasoline

"
81941,"

You can't change, I haven't
So now dry your tears
And tell me what you always say
You will

Good news! I'm not tired today
So move aside
I can drive us for an hour
Get lost
If you want to

Get lost
If I feel it I will too

Has it been a week today?
Oh, where are we
And shouldn't I have?
When you reassemble
Then remember to keep living this way

And get lost
If you want to

Get lost
If you feel that

Get lost
If I feel it I will too

"
81942,"

Come on just stay here
You're lucky you made it
We already had this fight
I will not have it twice

Come on let's face it
You're weird, I can take it and
That will not change tonight
So be my strange delight

Please don't think so hard
You haven't so far
I'm trying to make it easy
I am the voice of reason
And I won't let you leave

Take a look at this cozy room
We won't be moving any time soon
Take a look at this crazy light
Now tell me if you think it's waning, right?
We can talk it over
But I won't let you leave

Come on just stay here
You're lucky you made it
We already had this fight
I will not have it twice

"
81943,"

I'm never gonna be a cheerleader
I can't do tricks
And I ain't that sick
I'll never make it with the other believers
I don't have it
And I'm likely to quit

And today I'm being Lazy Jane
I'm feeling blue
'Cause I can't have you
Call me crazy
Hey, it may be true
I'm still crying for you

I'm never gonna be a pro-skater
I can't do tricks and I ain't that sick
I'm always gonna be a hazy deleter
All my stories
All my glory

And today I'm being Lazy Jane
I'm feeling blue
'Cause I can't have you
Call me crazy
Hey, it may be true
I'm still crying for you
Today I'm being Lazy Jane
I'm feeling blue
'Cause I can't have you
It never goes away
I know it's true
'Cause I'm still crying for you
I'm being Lazy Jane
I'm feeling blue
'Cause I can't have you
Call me crazy
Hey, it may be true
I'm still crying for you

"
81944,"

It's been a long day
You crashed your car
I flipped my lid off, went too far

It's safe to say it's been a bad night
Drink it off
I am a low-life, I am awful

But we are standing on Opposite Island
Maybe it's a good sign and we're alright

It's been a long day
There's a lot to talk about
I'll tell you later when it's over

We are standing on Opposite Island
Maybe it's a good sign and we're alright

There's a lot to talk about
I'll tell you later when it's over

We are standing on Opposite Island
Maybe it's a good sign and we're alright

"
81945,
81946,"

I am not here to make a change in you
I'm not here to make a home
You are afraid to break my heart in two
But you won't

You don't love me baby
And you never will
It's not a question still
But hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love honey?
You got me all wrong

So stop talking
You don't make sense
Don't say you're sorry solely in your own defense
If you can't understand it
Don't believe it's true
But keep your head on right
I need the rest of you

'Cause I don't love you baby
I'm just passing through
Til I get my hands on you
Hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love, honey?
You got me all wrong

If you don't see me crying
Don't rescue me
If you don't see me trying
I am occupied and free

You don't love me baby
You're no good for me
It's not a mystery
Hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love honey?
You got me all wrong

I don't love you baby
I'm just passing through
Til I get my hands on you
Hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love honey?
You got me all wrong

And the night
Frightening dark and
It was light
A big tree branches and
I was dancing
I'm straining
My broken neck and walking fast
Look at my glasses then
Look at her shoes

Break your arm, it ain't no face
Wear shoes, jealous, fuck you, stand up
(And I stare)

I wish you were a house to me
Frightening light so
Keep it dark
Keep your lights low so
I can't see inside
She runs
To the big people, but listen to me
I know

Break your arm, it ain't no face
Wear shoes, jealous, fuck you, stand up
(And I fall)

I look
What does she put on now?
Every day
Do you love her more than me?
All night long

Break your arm, it ain't no face
Wear shoes, jealous, fuck you, stand up
(And I scream)

"
82463,"

Harvest your tears, in a sieve
I can spill things down your shoulders - hold them
And I'm afraid you remind me of Santa Claus
In a good way

And you are like Santa Claus
I'll sit in a square

Oh in my head, oh my Santa Claus
(Run around, around, around, around in my boxes)
I see you at night, I shine
My arm in your chest
Now I'll sit in a square

Oh in my head, oh my Santa Claus
(Run around, around, around, around in my boxes)
Run around, around, around, around
In my boxes - I...

I know it's not your face
I love your neck
Now I sit in a square

Oh in my head, oh my Santa Claus
(Run around, around, around, around in my boxes)
Only eighteen-and-a-half, no two times
Nuh ho ho ho ho ho
Oh you. I love you, don't know
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

I see you at night, I shine
My arm in your chest
Now I'll sit in a square

Oh in my head, oh my Santa Claus
(Run around, around, around, around in my boxes)
Run around, around, around, around
In my boxes - I...

I know it's not your face
I love your neck
I sit in a square

Oh in my head, oh my Santa Claus
(Run around, around, around, around in my boxes)
Only eighteen-and-a-half, no two times
Nuh ho ho ho ho ho
Oh you. I love you, don't know
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

She colourblind tired eyes
Her hallway aching
She'll never move him - likes it that way
He's just a walker and he'll never stop walking away
It's not too soon he said
It's not too soon at all
You might as well be dead he said
If you're afraid to fall
I said -
I know her
She said -
Why do you stare so hard
Wrapped up like a doll in bad dreams and broken arms
Make these old bones shiver
It's not too soon he said
It's not too soon at all
You might as well be dead he said
If you're afraid to fall
I said -
I know her
The last time I saw you
You were standing in the dark
And with a freezing face
I watched you fall apart
It's not too soon he said
It's not too soon at all
You might as well be dead he said
If you're afraid to fall
I said
Done your time
Been in your place
I couldn't look you in the face
And tell you that it turns me on
It makes my stomach turn
I know her

Find shoes in the corner
Run away

Oh
He had a nightmare
Go
I'm losing my person
I'm only talking
But look at me, I'm in bed, I'm asleep
I'm a mess and my hair

Oh, oh, oh
Follow the road
Swallow a snake
Find shoes in the corner
Run away

No more backs
She can't say
America can't say no
Stand up
She can't stand up
Bang
She's afraid
I can't say
I can't say N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-No

Oh
It was a funeral
Mine
He was doing it
Under the stars
And I was crying again
Run through with a sword
Simultaneously
At the same time

No more backs
She can't say
America can't say no
Stand up
She can't stand up
Bang
She's afraid
I can't say
I can't say
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-No more backs

America can't say no
Stand up

Say no
Stand up
Stand up
I'm afraid, I'm a mess
So
Put this right
What's it look like?
I can't stand
I won't tell you she's dead

Follow the road
Swallow a snake
Find shoes in the corner
Run away
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-No

So it's cowboys in flying colors riding home
Leave my tears alone, it's too funny
Ah-ah-ahhh...

It's me and she spilling jewels and collarbones gray
(waste of time now I don't want cold, lonely)
Side by side little? down the road
And a she-wolf, my face one more square
Don't be afraid, it's my road
Once more alone

I can see them riding over the hills
Cowboy hats are back in
This is the future (and this is your future) after the war
And I don't eat anymore

It's me and she spilling jewels and collarbones gray
(Frank Lloyd Wright, try to sleep under a dome under the sky)

Side by side they go down the road
It's my road, once more alone

As a warm gun thanking her
She makes me dangerous
Blood on our teeth

Ready?

I'll defend you from the monster
If you show me what is right or wrong
If you help me off the bed and reach the phone

Did you say it was a raincoat?
Concentration has no hold on me
I don't wanna hurt but I'm so close to it

Excuse is no divide
So how come that you don't

Still you think we are the chosen?
I tried to phone you but you let it ring
Everything is so suspect a hair away from here

Excuse is no divide

Look through you
'Cause I could get there
Look to you
'Cause I thought we went there

But I'm not like the kind that you had before
Not gonna run to that open door
Not gonna try to get what I wasn't givin'

But I can see that you long for yourself
I can tell
That you need to belong on a shelf
Time goes by
As you sit here & waste in your room
I can feel
That you need someone close real soon

Done a lot for you
Like the time before
When I came right through
Picked you off the floor
Spent a lot of time
Just to get your name
You were a friend of mine
Thought you felt the same

But I can see that you long for yourself
I can tell
That you need to belong on a shelf
Time goes by

Done a lot for you

I think I've found a girl that I can talk to
Yeah I think I've found a girl that just might replace you
She don't care if I got bread
And I remember the things she said
Yeah I think she will do
Uh-huh

Oh
Don't you forget it
Oh
Don't you forget it

Cause when the summertime leaves your town
You know you ain't gonna find me around
I'll be out there to follow the sun
No I ain't gonna take no one
If you thought that you tied me down
Well girl it's high time that you found
Only thing left for you to see
You'll never find another man like me

I don't think I wanna hear 'bout none of your problems
You like to act like the only one who's ever got them
But I know something you don't know
You're gonna reap just what you sow
You stole some time of mine
Now it's time for you to go

Oh
Don't you forget it
Oh
Don't you forget it

Spent two years of my life in a foreign land
Came home to my own wife, had a different man
Saw fifteen sons and fathers lying on the ground
Just one click of my thumb, everybody's down

Oh it seems that this had become a dream
Life ain't just what it seems
Still run by ancient schemes

And oh, it shows
On the faces of those that know
Blood flows where the money's stowed
Gotta get your hands ?

But hey, what is anybody tryin'a say?

Spent two years of my life in a foreign land
Came home to find my mind still stuck in the sand
There are things I never thought that I could do
I had to tell myself ""Did 'em all for you.""

Oh it seems that this had become a dream
Life ain't just what it seems
Still run by ancient schemes

And oh, it shows
On the faces of those who know
Blood flows where the money's stowed
Gotta get your hands ?

But hey, what is anybody gonna say?

O que todos querem é só separar nós dois
Você é o que quero e vou continuar te amando
Eu não tô nem aí pro que os outros vão dizer
O que a gente sente ninguém tem nada a ver
Todos ficam falando que eu não sirvo pra você
Dizem que eu não presto só me meto em confusão
Querem nos afastar e acabar com nosso amor
Tirar você de mim
O nosso amor
Todos querem por um fim
Querem nos afastar
Tirar você de mim
O nosso amor
Todos querem por um fim
Querem nos afastar
Tirar você de mim
Eu amo você
E não me importa o que vão dizer
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
E não me importa o que vão dizer
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
O nosso amor
Todos querem por um fim
Querem nos afastar
Tirar você de mim
Eu amo você
E não me importa o que vão dizer
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
E não me importa o que vão dizer
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
Eu amo você
E não me importa o que vão dizer
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você

Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você

Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você
Eu quero só você

My rain it falls
Through dark mossy walls
Do you know where it's been?

My rain it comes
Through dark and purple plums
Do you know what I mean?

When the sun is tired of you
Hear the rain, and all it can do

My rain is light
Caresses you all night
Can you see what I've seen?

This house of ours
It flickers through the hours
In the fountains of green

When the moon is under a cloud
And the earth is under a shroud

I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I don't know what it's all about
I'm feeling here, I'm feeling
I'm feeling everywhere

Now that you're broke who's gonna
Fix you, fix you up
Fix you, fix you up

You've got a kidney on a fork
You've got a mouth that covers the size of New York
You've got a donkey on a string
But it's not leading you to anything

Now that you're broke who's gonna
Fix you, fix you up
Fix you, fix you up

Look in your eyes
Look in your eyes

Well, they sell you this stuff with the money that you never had
Then they want it all back
They make you redundant and blame you for being a slacker
While the financial backer
Is taking a call with a strawberry mousse

Now that you're broke who's gonna
Fix you, fix you up
Fix you, fix you up

I've got a mountain made of green
But nothing's ever gonna be enough for me
I'm breathing air, I'm breathing dust
I'm breathing anything that I can trust

Now that you're broke who's gonna
Fix you, fix you up
Fix you, fix you up
Fix you, fix you up
Fix you, fix you up

What are you for in the marketplace?
Who's gonna fix you, fix you up?
Who's gonna fix you, fix you up...

I wonder what she is thinking
As she's sitting next to me
Although her eyes are open
And she's staring at the sea

She's lost in contemplation
As her hair hangs to the ground
I wonder, is she praying?
Is she making any sound?

Be still

What is swimming through her mind
As she sits alone?
As beautiful as silence
And as quiet as a stone

I wonder where she's heading
When she goes back into town
Who does she relate to
When she puts her money down

Be still, let the darkness fall upon you
Be still, be still, let the darkness fall upon you
Be still, be still, let the darkness fall upon you

Her eyes are dark as berries
And her skin is a charcoal brown
She gazes into the future
And to where the sun goes down

To where the night is falling
On a lover or a friend
Somebody's beginning
Is just someone else's end

Be still, let the darkness fall upon you
Be still, be still, let the darkness fall upon you

Be still, be still, let the darkness fall upon you

Hooked into me
Like a burr
A single thorn
Anemic bond
Seeping through nylon
Leaking from under gloves
Stuck in milkweed

Hooked into me
Like a burr
A single thorn
Anemic bond
Seeping through nylon
Leaking from under gloves
Stuck in milkweed

Fingers reach through the chasm
To tug at my hem
But I wear a robe
Soaked in baptismal fluid
Untarnished
It hangs heavy
Drapes like leather
Clings like cellophane
I wear a wreath of fire
As a crown on my head
It hangs heavy
Sanctified
Cuts like this
Cuts like vinegar
Purifies like bleach
It hangs heavy

Fingers reach through the chasm
To tug at my hem
But I wear a robe
Soaked in baptismal fluid
Untarnished
It hangs heavy
Drapes like leather
Clings like cellophane
I wear a wreath of fire
Around my head
It hangs heavy
It hangs heavy
Sanctified
Cuts like vinegar
Purifies like bleach

Does he laugh, just to know
What he has?
Does he know who you are?
Does he laugh, just to know
What he has?

Does he know not to talk
About your dad?
Does he know when you're sad?

You don't like to be touched
Let alone kissed

Does he know where your lips begin?

Do you know who you are?
Do you laugh, just to think
What I lack?

Do you know your lip shakes
When you're mad?
And do you notice when you're sad?

You don't like to be touched
Let alone kissed

Does his love make your head spin?

I can see in your eyes that you mean it
I can feel in your arms that it's true
And though I just heard myself say it
Baby, I'm lying to you
Baby, I'm lying to you

All of these years you've been lonely
And not knowing not what you should do
And though you are right, I've been looking as well
Babe, I'm not looking for you
Babe, I'm not looking for you

I'm just as damn disappointed as you
Only I just do better to hide it
And the one thing that keeps me from falling for you
Is I'm truly alone and I like it
I'm truly alone and I like it

As we lie in bed I feel lonely
Though we're young, I feel eighty years old
And your arms around me are keeping me warm
But baby, I'm still feeling cold
Baby, I'm still feeling cold

And girl you must know you are lovely
You're kind and you're beautiful too
And I feel in some way I do love you
But babe, I'm not in love with you

It may seem strange that I still stay with you
If it's true you're not really the one
And why don't I just keep on looking for her?
Cause once I found her and now she is gone
Cause I found her and now she is gone
I found her and now she is gone

Sweetheart, what have you done to us?
I turned my back and you turned to dust
What have you done?

And oh please, just come here, don't fight with me
And I admit, think you may have broken it, will you admit?

And if all you wanted was songs for you
Well here goes, after all that you've put me through
Here's one for you

And don't call me lover, it's not enough
It's got to be tough, cynical stuff
Follow my words to the end of our love

And God, you were the one who told me not to be
So English

Sweetheart, what have you done to our love?

I can hear a statue
Wonder why they're so still
All able heels in a garden
Summer's water runs so quickly beside them!

Too young and growing

Over stone so still a statue's will to move
Like birds so stoically by the drain
Gardens carved of stone
The human whispers, so cold
A fountain ices over
A story over
A mouth says nothing

Forever marble
Topiary moment waiting
Im waiting by the drain
See the ice never thawing
Their legs always still
Like hearts so stoically
By the drain see gardens carved of stone
The humans whispers, so cold

With your silver lips and lies

When you go out with your friends
And your passion's transparent

Serve me heaven even when you're gone!
In my dreams
O, Moni
Hours become years when you're gone!

I look at you and I would rather look at you
Than all the portraits in the world

Digest your thoughts into the fuckin' right behavior

You better run and catch your thoughts, regress, no way back there
No matter if you feel buried alive

[Verse 2]
You're anxious for a change of state, keep the faith and wait
Tired of sleepwalking, a sign of unity will come into sight
Regress, no way!
Regress, no way back there
Digest your thoughts into the fuckin' right behavior

You better run and catch your thoughts, regress, no way back there

It was just like a dream
When we first got together
How our lips like a match

Lit a fire, I knew in my heart
It will not last forever
But forever is a long, long time

What a day, what a life
I always lobe the weather
When it's too hot to think, I might try

It tastes just the same
Your sweet sweet kiss like an ice cold drink
You want to find

Uh, uh, uh, magic summertime

It was just like I imagined when we first met
How our fingers became just one
I knew in my heart that our chances were slim
But a gambler never gambles to be wise

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, magic summertime

Autumn is borderline when winter is cruel
Spring can be tragically but summertime is magical

It was just like a fairytale when we were introduced
How our eyes like a flash filled with light
I knew in my heart we would both avoid the truth
But our cover was heavy with the wine

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, magic summertime
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, magic summertime
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, magic summertime

Crooked hands with crooked fingers
Crooked nose and crooked smile

Crooked heart and crooked mind

Crooked how he tried to kiss me
While I ate an apple whole
Everything he said was wrong
Or else he quoted Bob Dylan

We never seem to speak
We only remember some things

Crooked where he put the paper
Underneath the furniture
He was bent on big bent
Kicked the trash into the corner

Crooked how I always bully
Crooked how I miss the bond

I wanted to be possible for true love to exist
Wanted to be possible that you cannot resist
A house, a home, no wish to roam, no wish to be set free
Me and you and you and me, just the possibility

You told me from the very start you're not that kind of man
You told me that it breaks your heart to see me look so sad
You told me that it's hard to choose, you fall so easily
But all I ever asked you to was just the possibility

Why is it impossible to imagine life so full?
Don't you care a little bit, I might fulfilled your every wish

Why is it impossible to imagine life so full?
Don't you care a little bit, I might fulfilled your every wish

Of martini olives
I always drink two
Never three

My hair is plain brown
Once I was blonde
Yellow
Not towheaded

I like to drink coffee
With one cube of sugar
Always with cream
And never with milk

Only dark chocolate
I really love summer
I love to be warm
I love to feel hopeful

Under the stars
In Audrey's backyard
Wanting for someone
To kiss me

But someone would not
And time's getting short
The night's growing colder
And I'm going home

We danced and we danced
In my old apartment
When everyone left
Someone slept on the couch

I thought about love
And how I love somebody else
But is that enough?

Lining up memories
Each one a hair
At the edge of the mirror
I count and I stare

I wish that the quiet would end
With a telephone ring
Could a friend turn
Into a different thing?

Laughing and laughing
In my old apartment
But that's not what lovers do
They sigh and hope for the future

Wedding ring, do you know
What a girl has to do
Where a woman has to go
To find a man who wants to slip you on her finger?
What is the song, and who is the singer?

Wedding ring, it's a joke
If I wear my hair long or I wear my hair short
Who's the man who wants to make romance with me?
What is the dance and who wants to dance with me?
Wedding ring

So carefully crafted, mysterious band of gold
And what really comes after we grow old?

But he's a man who played the bait and switch
I keep on fishing but can't catch a fish

Shotty under the seat, windows tinted and up
Runners walk in the streets, numbers folded and stuffed
Into the bicycle spokes with little men watching the corners
[?] Around walking the beat the living, don't need your mourning, they need a fix
Tell 'em this song is it
This is the hours of terror you walk from minutes of bliss
This is the shit you don't tell noone you want to see cry
Cause (No one wants their friends to die)
This is the necessary transaction to keep your economy active
Activation, demographics, keep all the alliances passing
Passing the pistol man, they whistling shots
Pick up the juice in the fizzle baby he ain't getting caught
Put the freebase away, cause the block got hot

Yeah, we bring the yeah, you're cops on cop
Bullets gon' spray, the choppers gon' chop

This song is a drug deal
This song will fuck you up

Nights with no stars in the city with more cars than spaces
Outside clubs where inside suits talk TV sipping ace of spades
You can call it (Shangri-la)
As long as all your shades are dark enough you call it (Shangri-la)
Keep your veil on where you're married to the streets it's (Shangri-la)
Have you seen it (Shangri-la)

Take a walk to the smell of rotting life in the air on a trail of smoke
Wrapped in a swisher sweet like dreams are made of these evoke
A black Saturn with the top all ragged in the alley way off of seventh street
And the beat down low with a shift in park and the glow of the lamplight flickering
And a group of men with their clothes all red being nonchalant
With the ambiance is obviously dagger to the jugular
Who want to fuck with the waiting room for the voluntary incremental suicide
Is a suicide with suicide with thirty eyes like ""who am I""
But it look like ""who are you""
And If you here you look too
Like [?] like on ragtime bagtime bagpipe hit it, don't stop get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Everyday decapitation ordinary pain
In the bloodshot windows to the soul when pushes are inane
And turn the dial to the right is the only thing you gain
Thirty years of turning trickster trees and blaming it on rain
([?] Like the real thing!)
So you keep the coke dryest
([?])
This paint job the flyest
(Talkin' 'bout you and me baby!)
This some shit you should see baby
This, this shit ain't free yeah you should bring the money to me
You wanna hear cause you're pipe on E
And you're skin all itchin' and instead they hitting
And they never miss and you miss your mom
And you missed your calling because you came up to [?]
And your bitch is what, bitch is what?
Hold up, who you calling a bitch?
You and ITS is what we move and may God bless

[Hook]

Baby bones, are you cold?
Gather up your scattered toes
And I will hold them close
Baby bones, are you cold?
Are you cold baby bones?

A clattering of tones is
Throwing me off some
And often you're lonesome
'Cause as awful as it is
We all have forgotten not to forget

Anything about the way you say it
Anything about the way you play it
Anything about the way you say it
You say it so hollow, hello

"
84155,"

Caffeine and lack of real sleep
Knees deep in gasoline
Ask me if I'm afraid to speak
'Cause my words make heat
Which streets the one we meet at?
Can't keep my feet to the beat of yours
Read me from a map of the town
And I'll lay my head down

Crosswalk, we stop and wait for the light to change us
Talk more and compensate for all my silence
Hands wrapped in hands we're ready
Slow down baby we got the town map handy inside our heads
And I'll lay my head down

Meet me at the pretty lights time of day
Where the pretty lights give me a pretty face
Baby stay with me until we can't see
No more 'til we can't see no more
We glowed hard now we're dark for sure
Take hold of my arm at the elbow and we'll go

And I'll lay my head down

I'm always almost there

"
84156,
84157,"

All the blips of the sinking ships
Are all sinking into your skin
And I'm feeling older as my hair goes white
And I can not light up the dark

And all the violent waves

And I haven't left the house in 100 years
And you haven't left yours in 100 hours
And we can't keep our hands out of our own mouths
See the horrible habits we acquire

And all the rawest thumbs
From gnawing on them and rowing hard

You're a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
You're a nervous wreck

And how my stomach burns, but only at night
When the moon is bright
And I have dreams about bears
With the reddest mouths
But your arms are warm
And your legs are wrapped around
And the sound of your heart
The unsteady sound, I will slow it down

"
84158,"

The brokenhearted break their bones up into bread- then ball it up and stuff it in the holes in the sides of their heads. to stop the sound you stop the source- or is it the other way around? to stop the source you stop the sound. my bones are brittle- and i'm a little dry at the joints between them. pushing the choke in my throat down- i told you id go down- but you don't know- you never know. the open hearted make such a mess of themselves. the emptyhanded are pulling all the sparks right out from under their wheels. to stop-to stop- to throw off course- of course i know how easy for all those- who need and take and go. my bones are brittle- and i'm a little tired of sitting and getting fat. we all should close up- if we are sealing up enough- then we are feeling nothing- feeling nothing- feeling nothing

I sold my blood- to a hospital- but it wasn't very much blood so they didn't give me much money- they didn't give me much. i thought that you might like this- because it's got a shine to it- i know you like shiny things so i will try to buy it up for- and drive to you. i posed unclothed- for an artist in his home- but i couldn't hold it long enough and he didn't like my body much so he didn't give me much. i thought that you might like this because it's got a shine to it- i know you like shiny things so i will try to buy it up for you- and drive-

Standing room- I'm-a-put my legs to use. omnibus-all of us- were standing there in two's and three's

Beets bleed and tables have legs
I boiled up a feast
And the table it ran away a bloody mess
I need to stop singing in code
To start ringing true only
Because true rings only

Keep away from me
I am full of terrible things

Elbows, elbows and knee pads
Can you believe that that I still need them?
Scissors in window boxes
I buried three pairs
Can you see how hard it is?

Keep away from me
I am full of terrible things

My lazy shape is armed in dirty clothes
My arms are worn and scarred with beauty marks
So they can tell my lazy shape apart
From other shapes with hearts and human parts

Beware
Where I am is where
The channels run bare
The canals run bare
And there's much to be scared from
That didn't wash up til everything dried up

Keep away from me
I am full of terrible things
But if you love the terrible
Then please be near to me

Do you think that it's right?
All the way back home
I wait for you!
Gentle, so gentle
I haven't told you
That it feels wrong
I want to make it right
In line with the stars!
I'd like to make it try for real!
Your charms fall to the floor
One fit perfectly
If hell is all bored real harmony
Intimidating beauty
I'm not in danger, not in danger!
So you want to tell the threat.. through
Love these ...should you know!
I lost my way with you
Ending hon!
I haven't forgotten
There goes the charming's wrong
If she could dance under palms
And see her image
She would know the world outside be lost!
You lost me
Somewhere in the blue!

Gun out the burble low, we cannot meal
Gun thousands and downwards will glance
Take the burble stern
Above that dignity, well you know what I mean
One a merely voice has been turning up my tent
Trynna mere to get a job ‘cause my regacy has been spent
Tell me what’s happy, what matters paranoise me
Show I’m here my hands and we can port the fantasy
And above that dignity, you know what I mean
Upon that shame
Show I’m here on the back yard working on a hall
It’s gonna be my area, the peace not allowed to go
It’s gonna be my privilege, to run away I’m hide
Chap up on the chock up pipe smoke when the tears wall up inside
And above that dignity, you know what I mean
Feel deploration, how it were this deep inside?

You've always been the critic's darling
And a hit at all the fancy parties
But for me, man you don't do nothing
I see through your charade
I hate you Chardonnay
You're the grape that launched a thousand strippers
The soccer mom's favorite sipper
I can't think of anything sicker
Get the fuck out of my backstage
I hate you Chardonnay
I hate you Chardonnay
I hate you Chardonnay
I hate you Chardonnay
I see through your charade
I hate you Chardonnay

The way you move makes me stop!
My mind is hard, my brain is soft
I tried to speak, but I cannot talk
I'm frozen, but it's so hot, I'm on!
Baby, baby, oh baby, yeah
I, I, oh, goddman!
I tried to hold you, but you're like sand
Slipping through these broken of mine
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
Oh, I feel, yeah, I feel
I feel you slipping away!

I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small

I'm not on so greedios trip
I'm fine with little sips
I'm good with ladders, sams and piffs
Now let me go down the list
Memo production, low years
Intimate settings, living it up appeals
Dinget basements, showing ones
No expectations, wait I'm not done!

I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small

I don't need no magnum
A snub nose would do just fine
And I'll take gg allan
Over long dong silver any time
And when I orgy, I capital 12
Going forth and I get overwhelmed

Don't you swear the little things
I like to try to sweep them in
I keep em tucked, in my fist
What they might be, you can only guess
And when I show my hand
You will finally understand
That I've got big enough balls
To admit that I like it small

I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small

I took a step back and made an assessment
I took a long hard
Look at my life!
Gonna take a step forward and make an adjustment
It's hard time, I set things right!

Chorus:
Embrace the positive, reject the negative
But what about the neutral
She's neither here nor there!
What to do with the neutral?
It's not an easy problem!
What to do with the neutral?
It's not an easy problem!
Problem to solve!
I will say no to nothing, and yes to something
But I have no idea what that something should be!
Nothing from nothing, leaves nothing
I need Billy Preston to unlock this mystery!

Chorus:
Embrace the positive, reject the negative
But what about the neutral
She's neither here nor there!
What to do with the neutral?
It's not an easy problem!
What to do with the neutral?
It's not an easy problem!
Problem to solve!

(Verse)
I stare into a belly through the eyes of a beast
Made a toast to life and commence the feast
We chewed up mitten creams till our mouths would ooze and foul
Devour man from meat, sucking marrow from the bone
Washed it down with wine, Vintage 1953
Leaned back in our chairs, sucked a bone and picked our teeth

(Verse)
Gazing at our bellies, I watched the unfolding of time
Stricken by a bolt eyed brother, there's no way that child is mine
Silence gripped the table till the sobbing began
And her console and the scolding from the wives of all the men
To glare down at the plates, faces flushing red
The women now demanded a platter with my head

(Verse)
The knowledge in my head fit the anger in my heart
The vomit in my hands meant the chocking will soon start
I grabbed the throat of the nearest shrew, she was sitting at my right
Someone brained me with a skillet, boom boom, out go the lights

(Verse)
I was watching from above my body
Face down on the floor
They gathered round my carcass, gasping in horror
What do we do about the body, someone cried
I heard them without a body, ""there can be no trial""
But the meat all quickly changed and they all got down to work
That is how it was I who became the final course

[Intro]
You are about to embark on the most wonderful experience of your life
I will not explain at this moment how and why it works; I don’t have the time
It just does

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Well it’s been a while, and I’ve been alone
And you’ve been the only thing I’ve known
Born in the south, at home in the north
But we could be anywhere you want

Now you’re taking me down where you grew up
I wish I had known you when we were young
You figured me out, I know I said it enough
But waiting is just too much

[Chorus]
So cover my skin with your sun-kissed light
There’s a bonfire burning tonight
We could be all right
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

[Hook]
Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

[Verse 2]
Picture it now, down the road
Oh just say the word and I’ll go
Wherever you are, whatever the coast
You are the one I care for the most

Remember the night, we slept on the roof
Well I didn’t sleep much to tell the truth
Now we’re the sand, caught in the tide
We laugh until we cry

[Chorus]
Won't you cover my skin with your sun-kissed light
There’s a bonfire burning tonight
We could be all right
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

[Hook]
Oh Evaline, oh Evaline
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

[Bridge]
Pull me closer, hold me tighter
The nights are long but the stars are brighter
Pull me closer, hold me tighter
Take me down, take me down, take me down

[Chorus] + [Hook] (simultaneously)
Oh won’t you cover my skin with your sun-kissed light
There’s a bonfire burning tonight
We could be all right
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

Won't you cover my skin with your sun-kissed light
Won’t you cover my skin with your sun-kissed light
Won’t you cover my skin with your sun-kissed light
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

[Hook]
Ooooh
Ooooh
Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline

A kiss of wind
Branches and grooves
Heatsoaked red skin

Just to find a way to bring me back down

Freeze time to the bone

We all end up alone

Patriot glory and body bags
Crippled soldiers in bright parades
Impotent leaders with megaton missiles
Smile and wave as the wreaths are laid

Cold grey tombstone friendly fire
Watch the star striped banners wave
Broken mothers ever mourning
Carry the burden from the grave

New blood feeds the war machine
Children's bones will pave the way
Down this path of greed's construction
Unless we stand to change the way

Rise the masses spirits burning
Oppression's walls must fall today
Insurrection paths of glory
Stand and claim the brave new day

Everything counts if you know how to count it
I’m shaving a hat and pretending I planned it
I remember your name, I’m just a comedy genius
Yeah but you'll never know who I am, it's a secret

Have you ever seen award making film making?
And have you ever seen a thing called a shred of a doubt?
Have you ever seen a man, out on the town
Out of his head, but he’s still important?

I don’t want to believe it
I don’t want to believe it could happen
I don’t want to believe it
'Cause if I didn’t see it right, then it can’t happen right now

Yeah, life keeps going, life keeps going
Life keeps going, life keeps going on
Yeah, life keeps going, life keeps going
Life keeps going, life keeps going on
Even after I'm gone

I used to think that I knew what was going on
But I don’t know
I used to think I was doing something serious
But that’s a joke
I used to think that i knew what was going on
But I don’t know
I used to think I was doing something serious

Let's turn down the static world
Leave my fortress of solitude
Taste the petals of a rose in bloom
This is where the place must be
I wrap my arms around the ceiling
To reach beyond what i can't see
Let's turn down the static world
Listen to the sound of a void
Shall i join the black parade?
The eternal masquerade?
This is where the place must be
I wrap my arms around the ceiling
To reach beyond what i can't see
Let's turn down the static world
Listen to the sound of a void

I was dancing alone at the edge of the world
I was singing my own praises to an audience of stone
I was listening in on phone calls to god
I was laughing to myself because i know there's no one home
So if they're right
Ya if they're right
And time caves in tonight
Let me be there when it happens
The halo from her head, the fire to her throne
Blood tears bled a thousand years for empty, hollowed eyes
By their trials, condemned again and again
In the face of history their spit burns to the bone
So if they're right
Ya if they're right
And time caves in tonight
Let me be there when it happens

You're on a road to revocation
You're in a fast autonomous automobile
And now you can't change your destination

With some instructions on a giant poster
Oh but you can't see the signs asleep at the wheel

One day our house must burn down
My memory will fade
Move on, it's getting late
I chose a right direction
By opening my arms
But there's a limit to our days

This is the end of everything I look forward to
And why did I let my daily thoughts lead me away from you?

Whatever takes me away
I will come back to you
I'll do what it takes to get there
Whatever takes me away
I will come back to you
I'll follow your footsteps

I don't want a happy ending
I just want a start
A future for our past
Tell me what has happened
To endless careless days
I knew they would not last

This is the end of everything I look forward to
And why did I let my daily thoughts lead me away from you?

Whatever takes me away
I will come back to you
I'll do what it takes to
Whatever takes me away
I will come back to you
I'll follow your footsteps

Let's squeeze out every drop
Life is too short to stop
Why can't we stay a safe distance away from the top?
We talk and talk and talk and then agree
It won't set us free

The dj is playing a song
I'm caught singing along
Words hit my ear and I know crystal clear I was wrong
My thoughts go round and round while hearing the sound
I still haven't found

The sheer comfort of drinking and taking pills
Is not enough for me
I need something real to grasp on to
The sheer comfort of drinking and taking pills
Is not enough for me
I need something real to grasp on to

A time to be born, and a time to die
If it's all useless, why should I try?
To do what is right in your eyes
Why should I?

A time to seek and a time to lose
Do I have options, something to choose?
A time to laugh and a time to cry
Why should I?

A time to mourn and a time to dance
Why should I bother if it's all chance?
If life is just one sad goodbye
Why should I?

I want to live and don't want to die
If it's all useless, why should I try?
The day is done and the end is nigh
Why should I?

A time to be born, and a time to die
If it's all useless, why should I try?
To do what is right in your eyes
Why should I?

The details are coming back
Painting over black
They wake me and make me smile
On Saturday mornings
I was walking on the chairs
If I could I’d meet you there

Pictures made in ’84
I can’t see them any more
I remember everything

The sound of the neighbours phone
Our broken doorbell’s drone
I still hear it loud and clear
When the war was still cold
The stories we were told
They took place so far from here

Sit still and wait
I’m sailing a stormy lake

Picures made in ’84
I can’t see them any more
I remember everything
In a dream and on tv
All the memories come to me
I just want them to remain

The details are coming back

The way you look reminds me of a movie scene
That we were in
You said your line and I was shocked in black and white
Our plot wore thin

How the years went by in a single sigh
Have you understood?
On this sinking ship we are losing grip
This ain't Hollywood

Oh, I can imagine everything ends well
That far away
All the scenes you're showing me seem to be the parts
That I can't play

On this sinking ship we are losing grip
Have you understood?
This ain't Hollywood

You pretend that you're not faking
Plastic dreams won't last for long
And as long as hearts are breaking
I'll play my part by being strong

This ain't Hollywood

"
85323,"

I went to stay the night away
Sleeping on the beach
A perfect sight on guiding lights
Kept you within reach
Our worn out track made me think back
To where it all began

While my trust tried to leave
Faith was growing underneath my fear
When the rain touched my skin it was clear
I was not alone

The stars they shine much brighter now
But it appears to me
I can't make it on my own
And let you keep the key

While my trust tried to leave
Faith was growing underneath my fear
When the rain touched my skin it was clear
I was not alone

It's hard to trust what you can not see
When I'm falling you will carry me

"
85324,"

If you could name what we want to be part of
Ideals that we share but never show
The beauty's hidden underneath the surface
Today might be the day to let it go

You're screaming out that you might need a saviour
A hero or a saint to heal our broken hearts

We should have left these thoughts so many years ago
But time and time again we don't and let them grow
You are a mirror showing me what I hide
How far do you bend before you break the light?

Where can I find the words to take you higher?
I'm staring at the books I never read
I fear to feel the fear that's still inside you
And fill my thoughts with words I leave unsaid

You're screaming out that you might need a saviour
A hero or a saint to heal our broken hearts

We should have left these thoughts so many years ago
But time and time again we don't and let them grow
You are a mirror showing me what I hide
How far do you bend before you break the light?

Why don't you tell us
Is it better to hold on
Than to hold on to what we had?
Once we had a dream
We all tried tried to make the best
Of what we tried hard to forget
On and on we run
Looking for cover
And something real to cling on to

Where were you?
Why do you stand so far off in times of need?
Let us please set our hearts
On something that we can believe

You saw everything
Kept us waiting
Show us the empty parts that much need to be filled
Why don't you tell us
Who will lead us
To the place where we were meant to lay our hearts

Where were you?
Why do you stand so far off in times of need?
Let us please set our hearts
On something that we can believe

"
85326,

I used to make plans for the years ahead
Piled them up inside my head
While time spun its web around
All the dreams I turned down
I have to face now where I have gone
'cause tomorrow has just begun

My dreaming heart slowly fell apart
Somehow I need another start
Spider, you put me in your web
And left me there in my despair

I'm stuck in my ever growing past
Time took over way too fast
Is there a way to get out of here?
I feel the spider drawing near

My dreaming heart slowly fell apart
Somehow I need another start
Spider, you put me in your web
And left me there in my despair

If I could turn back time
I'd say: Life's what you make it

"
85328,"

I was thinking about the end of the story that I'm in
Let's walk to the horizon and just leave them wondering
The closing titles should begin with ""it was not enough""
I guess back then you knew I wasn't ready for your love

I believe that time will teach me when
We'll meet again and climb our ladder to the moon
This is almost home

I thank you for the rain that showed me there are times of doubt
It made me wonder about the sun and gave meaning to the clouds
I'm happy to be here, knowing where I'll be someday
With your heart close to mine we'll keep the black moods far away

I believe that time will teach me when
We'll meet again and climb our ladder to the moon
This is almost home

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt!
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of what?
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So take it all
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So it take it all

START LOOKING FOR A NEW ESCAPE

The lights are out, we are all alone
I'm standing in front of you
I'm running faster than I can tonight
It makes you feel alright
It makes you feel okay
We know that this is just a dream
An endless dream reminding me
Of all the bright lies we used to tell, but why?

[Bridge]
I wanna dream about pleasant things tonight
I wanna dream about things that make me smile
Things that make me feel okay

[Verse 2]
The time has moved again, you're on your own
Why don't you stay home
The nightmare's waiting in the yard
Cause after all, you're lost
Just expect the worst
Time is moving on and on
You're still alone
You're still alone

Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around

Dry your eyes, dry your own eyes
Last time I cried nobody dried mine
That's fine

You're all grown so dry your own crying eyes

Wipe your mouth, wipe your own mouth
You asked me for my poison and now you want to spit it out

You're all grown so wipe your own poison mouth

You're a grown woman
Out in the world
If you allow this well then you deserve this
To cry like a little girl
Cry like a little girl

Tell me no, you could tell me no
You could refuse my choke-hold
We both know you won't
All is fair, all in love is fair
You're nobodies baby
And you're in no one's care
This is love and all that I do to you is fair

You're a grown woman
Out in the world
If you invite this well then you must like this
To cry like a little girl
Cry like a little girl

Now I'm alone and hurt
I need my little girl to hurt

I'm grown man
Out in the world
If I allow this well then I deserve this
I'm grown woman
Out in the world

The sense of abandon
The end is near
Feel the light of your eyes
Just disappear

Flowing away
On a stream of red trance
Steel penetrates
Your empty shell

Slow deep and hard
Alive or dead this day
Don't care anyway

Drug effect
She don't feel a thing
The blade twists
Nothing for her to cling on

Slow deep and hard
The screams can't stop
The way for equilibrium

Always wanting
Always needing
Still craving
Always fading… Out

Twist the knife
Twist the soul
Order out of chaos
Led out of Gold

Hold your screaming
Bite your tongue
Glitter in your eye
Love in disguise

Blood Roses
Liquid roses on the floor
The more you twist
And she ask for more
Poetry in motion
Love without despair
Blood roses
Splashes on her hair

"
86060,"

Time don't heal
Just corrodes everything
Just like blood
Coagulate and turns dark

Underneath the grey sky
Machinery screeches with rust
Visions of decay
And we just fade away

Corroded
And left to die

Damaged and forlorn
Rotten to the core
Damaged and forgotten
I can not take this anymore

No hope no tears
No light no dark
Without sense of direction
Not a glimpse of the spark

You know the feeling
You know the idea
Only confusion in your head
But without fear

Damaged and forlorn
(CORRODED!)
Rotten to the core
(LEFT TO DIE!)
Damaged and forgotten
(CORRODED!)
I can not take this anymore
(WHY?)

"
86061,"

Touch me
Touch me once and leave me aching
I want to feel your lust for me
I want to hear your body
I want to see you on the floor
Crying out for those moments you adore

Burning...
Burning from the inside

I touch you
Just like you want me to
I need to see
You want me
See you suffer
See your pain
And when you try to take me
Push you once again

Burning...
Burning from the inside

You're the devil in me
I see the devil in you
You make doubt, make me scream
I burn for touching you

And with that you leave me
Breathing hard and wishing
Calling out for what I see
I know what lies in you
Still you deny

Burning...
Burning from the inside

All those small things I adored
Gone and lost, that's it, I swore
Trapped and crawling on the floor
Once a whore you're nothing more

Burning...
Burning from the inside

You're the devil in me
I see the devil in you
You make doubt, make me scream
I burn for touching you

"
86062,"

Our pulse and throb
These outbursts thought extinct
We are nothing more
Than pure animal instinct

Excuses by thousands
Falling short of pure savagery
But still nothing more than pure
Animality!

Going at each others throats
For a pound of flesh we fight
Humanity's fragile ropes
No longer seem so tight

Dog eat dog
It's a perfect world
We're all so flawed
In our perfect world

Take a bite out of me
Assimilate this mere flesh you see
One and all mere fiends
With ends that justify the means

"
86063,"

You see a god
When you look at me
An idol, flawed...
Of lust and sodomy

My thought is bane
My word a cry
I sit and reign
On a throne of lie

As I slid my tongue
Your river dried
To each other clung and...
So ugly inside!

As you lay low
In front of me
In you I grow
My blood runs free

"
86064,"

I bring you death
And steal your breath
I am your fiend and foe
The pain I reap I've sewn

Into you I carve my love
With every gush of blood
That flows out from that wound
My seeds of passion bloom

I succumb to the inner thirst
So violent this outburst
This craving I cannot quell
Again I descend to Hell

My word is bind and chain
You love to hate my pain

I descend to Hell

I am prey
To the ultimate
Desires of the fleshy pleasures
This longing I cannot see but feel
Breaks my mind... and will

Have you ever seen a dog run like that mad fucker Barney’s magic dog?
He’ll rip your bollocks off and tear it in tiny pieces, Barney’s magic dog
Barney’s magic dog has run away
Barney’s magic dog ain’t here today

"
86148,"

Come sailing on this little boat I made
We’ll take a tour of all the little things you hate
And you’ll see the light, you’ll see that life is not what you make it
Strip off your skin, the mess you’re in
Just lie down and take it

A little whirlpool right inside your brain
The paper cripples as it ripples down the drain
You wanted me more than words could say
I lick your wounds at the end of your weary days
But you waltz with your worries
You dance with your broken back
You’re twisted, contorted
You’re kittens in a burlap sack

One day I’ll whittle all your dreams away

"
86149,"

I’ve been waiting for you to come by for quite some time
(and that’s no lie)
The big surprise is on your face
There’s magic flowing all over this place

There’s a swamp right in front
(and right behind)
Although your mind is cracking up and running dry
Let down your hair and grab that wine
And get it all over with before it gets old

I made an effort once
You remember that
You might like to live like this but I won’t
You remember that
And grind all your teeth right down while you sit at home
And chew the fat, you’re good at that
15 years ain’t long
15 weeks ain’t long
15 days ain’t long
15 hours ain’t long

"
86150,"

The night is foggy, his path is clear
He watches you walk out of here, following close
The cobbles slippy with mud and mist
A hasty glance down at your wrist
The night’s a ghost

Lamplight shines its last
The crowd has long since past
Now it’s just you sharing the morning chills
With a hey there stranger mind if I join you?
Mind if I slide my eyes up on you?
No need for talking, wandering, walking
I’ll eat those clouds from out your mouth

(hey) soul digger
(please) lane whistler
(don’t) dead swinger
(leave) dead swinger

Memory throws up a magpie from out its nest
Due to die, you ask mom why
I’m sorry son that’s just the way things are
When little birdies stray too far
Just let it lie
That circumstance aside
There is a frenzy in these eyes
The kind that roots you to the spot until

You hear a dead swinger

"
86151,"

I’m wearing circles in the floor
Drowning in the clothes I wore a month ago or more
You know the simple things in life are best
I clutch my tea like mother’s breast
The crows eat cake while I rest

OCD patrol
The white space has been breached
Dead tv spits static through me
But at least I’m not losing it

You know I pace these empty halls at night
I turn to smoke, do what I like
Tomorrow when it’s bright I’ll go outside

But the crowds down there don’t look too civilized
Just try it out sunshine you might just be surprised
There’s clothes to dry and screens to fry my dusty eyes
I’m frozen solid, hours go by, I realise that I’m losing it

This is your face
It's like a rainbow
This your brain
It's like a light rain
This is your eyes
Like flashlights
This is your mind
The damn thing's always growing

But the fear of giving in
Makes me want to scream crying

Gotta think straight
I'm gonna keep my promises
I can stay sane
There'll be no need for changes
Don't have to be afraid
I might even have fun

This is OK and I'm alright
I'm just feeling a little scared

But the fear of giving in
Makes me want to give in

You don't have to be afraid

Not going to the show, just wanna stay at home
'cause I don't care about Friday night
Not going anywhere, it doesn't feel right
No I don't care about Friday night
Gonna lay around and mope, turn off all the lights
I don't care about Friday night
I'm gonna sit in my room and think about you
I don't care about Friday night
So no I won't be there, 'cause I'm not going anywhere
Not without you

[Verse 1]
Sun is shining, I'm not trying to be what you want me to be
Yes, I'm lying 'cause I'm shy, and I do not want you
To see my thoughts because they're tangled in a web
Yeah, you heard what I said

[Chorus 1]
There's music in the background
And now rain falls on the roof
I'm trying to be polite
But I think I should give you the truth

[Verse 2]
Sitting at the table, staring at you while you stare at me
Making idle chit-chat while the night moves on
You know that it takes two of us to open up our hearts
To understand the parts

[Chorus 2]
That seem so secretive
That seem so distant and aloof
I'm trying to be polite
But I think I should give you the truth

[Bridge]
It always ends this way
I always wanna say
In an ideal world you'd tell me
Why you cannot sleep at night
In an ideal world you'd come to me
And you would hold me tight

[Verse 3]
Friday night, this dinner party seems to be going quite well
If I just mind my business then I will look like
A normal hostess, but I just wanna see inside your mind
Show yours and I'll show mine

[Chorus 1]
There's music in the background
And now rain falls on the roof
I'm trying to be polite
But I think I should give you the truth

[Verse 1]
Dreams, they come and go
This is one that I've had forever, I know
Been crossing my fingers and always hoping
For it to come true

Waiting for the train
I can see your face in the distance again
Got a little dream that's become a friend
And a reality

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm running just as fast as I can to tell you the news
We can do this together, we can, yeah, me and you

[Chorus]
When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

[Verse 2]
Dreams, they come and go
But I just kept doing what I loved even though
All I ever wished for was out of breath
Running so slow

I found the lock and the key
Now I can be everything I've wanted to be
Got a little dream that's become a friend
For the melody

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm running just as fast as I can to tell you the news
We can do this together, we can, yeah, me and you

[Chorus]
When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

[Bridge]
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby

[Chorus]
When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

[Refrain]
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat

When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

[Verse 1]
Remember when you told me in the morning, you said I was tough
Tougher than the average woman, but I guess that is not tough enough
'Cause when you left me on the weekend, I was crumbling
At the roots and the stem, like a flower dying in the garden

[Verse 2]
Now you're gone, I have to strengthen up my little heart
Find my own way, light my torch and sparkle my own spark
When I wake up in the morning I feel very numb
But I'm gonna get through, I'm gonna tell myself every day

[Chorus]
Get yourself up, get yourself up
Get yourself out of bed
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
Snapping your fingers, tapping your toes
You are humming a tune, you know, you know
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today

[Verse 3]
On the borderline from what is right to what is wrong
There I am and there I try, I try to carry on
And when I'm standing on a mountain I feel brave and strong
Yeah, I'm gonna get through with or without you

[Chorus]
Get yourself up, get yourself up
Get yourself out of bed
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
Snapping your fingers, tapping you toes
You are humming a tune, you know, you know
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today

[Bridge]
I'm gonna change, I'm gonna change
I'm gonna change the way I see myself today
But there’s gotta be an easier way
An easier way to start the day

[Chorus]
Get yourself up, get yourself up
Get yourself out of bed
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
Snapping your fingers, tapping your toes
You are humming a tune, you know, you know
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today

Driftin’ pairs to my bedroom window
Rising high over the meadow
Blonde red and white moon beams
Hand of the driving in the speedway
Johnson brand all through the night
The pepsi moon

The [?] said it can’t be done
Never has nothing else shown the sun
Out in the desert being and protector
Be the legend of the marketing director

[Chorus]
She was right
Sea saw the light
In pepsi moon

[Verse 3]
[?] sailors wept for home
In The purple cloud with the mem’ry
I should read dreams flashing their minds
Deep in the jungle on contacting childs
Witnessed the omen of the coming of the end

They saw the light
In the pepsi moon

""Lifeless, indifferent face on the wall
Who is the fairest moon this fall?""
I've spent a season with the wolves at the door
With dirty magazines, spread out, all across the floor
Some say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
But that's just a lazy way to dismiss the seed
I'm going to put on a few hundred years
And I'm looking to earn them through your blood and your tears

[Verse 2]
Won't you to listen to the sound of my voice
And know I was created by chance not by choice?
Some may call that the death of the light
But I only call it ""Embracing the night""
Too many hands are held out to take
And too many hands aren't prepared to break
Another season with the wolves at the door
Hungry and scratching and begging for more
They're always there

[Verse 3]
There is a future your eyes may not see
And there is a future you may not believe
There is a future that'll be here in time
But some won't make it to sign on that line
Some may not

[Verse 4]
I've seen an endless sky of ships explode
And realised some men, they will never make it home
It is a time when all of us will know
We'll find out if we're gonna reap what we sow
Or is it the other way around?

[Bridge]
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold, cold, cold, cold
When the rain comes down, and lose the tears as they fall
It's cold, cold, cold, cold
Pull a lesser man from a ledge and then and then and then...
And it's cold and it's cold
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold

[Outro]
I want to cast off the wings of desire
I want to be buried in a field of fire
I want to stand up and be twenty feet tall
I want to reach out and feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I want to reach out and feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I want to reach out and feel nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Nothing, feel nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I wish I'd feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
No nothing, no, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I wish I'd feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing
(Woah! Yeah!)
Nothing, nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Well nothing, at all

I would rather you with than without me
Let it out of the dark so the pines can see
I would rather be hurt than be sappy
But you're like the cats meow meow purrrrrrrrr
And when you've fallen behind just be happy
That you know winters fall is winters summer seeeeed purrrrrrrr

There's safety in the numbers of this godforsaken town
It's been a week since all of this went down
In this abandoned factory, there's no one here but you and me
And god help any fool who comes around

And you, with your coy and fickle eyes, you'll get your way
And me, I have got no say in my own destiny
The way it's going, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no

It didn't go the way I planned, we had it in our hands
And everyone had followed our demands
But then you shot that plainclothes cop, I heard a pop and watched him drop
Now we both have blood upon our hands

And you, well, you made it sound so simple and it was
And now, I am a fugitive and you're the only cause
The way it's going, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no

Oh shit, I think I heard a sound from over by the door
I see their shadows looming on the floor
An inch, a mile, it's all the same, now that I am in this game
A shout is heard and time is running out

And you, in the chaos of the moment grab your gun
And you, you aim the barrel at that two ton oil drum
Now I know it, Stickybee, you will be the death of me
Now I know it, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no

"
88848,"

Grace, I watched you sleeping
All worn out and dreaming
You slept through the fall

I know you love this time of year
It always made you smile

Grace, I watched you breathing
All quiet and peaceful
But you were so weak

When I left that night I somehow knew
Your patient heart was finally through

But I never cried
I never cried

Everything falls for a reason
Gravity pulls it to earth
Everyone to a season
Everything falls into place
Witness the fall of Grace

Grace, none of us blamed you
Nobody shamed you
When we laid you down

Everyone was there, you know
Your folks, your friends, and me
But I never cried
I never cried

"
88854,"

The cold fever, a cellular germ
The stray tingle, a chemical burn
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna see you

The same cycle, everyday
This sick head, gonna wash it away
Go away, go away, go away

You make me feel so clean
You make me kick and scream
You make me, you make me
You make me feel so clean

A snap, crackle, a fizzling sound
My skin itches and twitches around
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna feel you

My pulse races and wanders astray
This sick head, gonna burn it away
Go away, go away, go away

[Chorus]
I lather and rinse and repeat
You leave me feeling complete
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna keep you

I lather and rinse and repeat
You leave me feeling complete
Go away, go away, go away

[Chorus]

Stupid is as stupid does, and Lester's done it all
We can't afford to just ignore the writing on the wall
Thin the herds and purge the group
Yeah, leave behind that nincompoop

Lester is a dimwit and I've known my share of fools
He's bringing down the system and he's breaking all the rules
Thin the herds and purge the group
Yeah, leave behind that nincompoop

And watch him roam away

The decision here is hard, but all the same it must be done
The necessity of the many far outweighs the needs of one
Thin the herds and purge the group
Yeah, leave behind that nincompoop

Lester, we must thank you but for now it's our farewell
We wish you all the best when you are burning down in hell
Thin the herds and purge the group
Go to hell, you nincompoop

And we watch him burn away

"
88858,"

Wasted away on the edge of the city lights
At the top of the Southern heights
You smoked the last one

Breaking away from the cold chains of memory
From the us and the them, or we
Somehow the same

And you were the vagabond at the end of the road
You were never really gone, but you were never really home

You spread your arms on the edge of the jagged cliff
I could feel my arms get stiff
As I clenched your shoulder

Stained skin and scars, and the glow of the Norther star
Above the clamor of the speeding cars
In the valley below

And you were the vagabond at the end of the road
You were never really gone, but you were never really home
And you were the vagabond, lost on the way
You were never really gone, but you were never here to stay

Break of the day, you were standing there
With your vacant stare
Fixed on the view

And you were the vagabond at the end of the road
You were never really gone, but you were never really home
And you were the vagabond, lost on the way
You were never really gone, but you were never really here to stay
And now you're moving on

"
88860,"

I saw you bathing in the river
I saw you throwing off the water from your beautiful wings
I want to live a life of brightness and purity
Beautiful like you

Envy, desire
Waiting on the wire
Till the other birds are gone
Wade in the springs
To bleach those dirty wings
The raven and the swan
The raven and the swan

I was a circle in the water
Spreading out along the edges, and breaking up on the shore
A little bit of time and I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful like you

[Chorus]

"
88861,"

Desire took a seat at my side
And softly said to me
""I know you want to go your own way
But you're too weak to be free.""

I said to it, ""I know you mean well
But this time you are wrong
I've thought this through, I promise you, I've got to move on
And I don't want you along.""

Here I stand with a bird in hand and here I will remain
I would rather let it stay than to watch a hundred fly away
You'll be fine in a little time when I am out of view
I'm not trying to say goodbye, I know I'll see you soon

"
88863,"

The streets of Salem were a terrifying sight
The witches dancing with the demons in the night
Their evil minions watch the town as it's in bed
They wish 'em dead, with 'em dead, wish 'em dead

Old Rev. Parris knew that something was amiss
He felt the evil from a spiritual abyss
He knew the time had come to purify the town
Hunt 'em down, hunt 'em down, hunt 'em down

No time was wasted in assembling a squad
This pitchfork army on a mission sent from God
No witch was safe from Rev. Parris' brigade
Their crusade, their crusade, their crusade

""Call the magistrate and don't you wait another minute cuz this
Town is going to hell we don't put away the sinnin' and..
We got no time to let a jury have their turn
Let 'em burn, let 'em burn, let 'em burn""

The damned were crammed into a carriage in the square
Their faces battered and their bodies all were bare
The Reverend brought 'em to an isolated hill
Time to kill, time to kill, time to kill

One by one their necks were snapped beneath the cedar tree
The spirits vanished and the demons all were freed
They dug a hole to hold their devilish remains
They were slain, they were slain, they were slain

The town was safe from all these wicked dissidents
They could continue with their life of innocence
Dispensing justice from a higher power..

They built a church atop the spirits and the bones
Their moans were heard as they were laying down the stones
The witches got revenge beneath that steeple bell
They cast a spell, sent the Reverend to hell

"
88864,"

Wait, where is my bed, I thought I was there
I swear that I didn't come sit in this chair
But here I am, I guess that's fine
It's only something:49
I'll sleep it off tomorrow if I can

Did I take the pills? I think I'll take more
I thought that I left them here in this drawer
I guess I'll sit and think about
The last time that I took them out
And maybe I will remember where they are

There, drawer
Here, floor
Where, more
Huh

There, bed
Here, bad head
Thr heh huh

88867,"

Midnight, we're crashed out in a field in Missouri
Me and you in my '82 VW in hiding

Stretched out, my frizzy hair is everywhere in tangles
You smile, and ruffle up my bangs and say to hell with it

Let's wipe the slate and release the weight
We've carried for so long
Cuz here we are beneath the stars
With no one else

Sleep tight, cuz from tonight they're never going to find us
No chains, we'll change our names and stake our claim in Omaha

"
88868,"

The skies they opened up, and now the frogs are pouring out
Splattering and scattered on the ground
Falling on the sidewalk, in the middle of the street
This couldn't ever happen but it did

We are standing silent in a stupor at the sight
Gazing on with glazy eyes apart
Oh, you couldn't ever see, it couldn't ever be
This couldn't ever happen but it did

The canvas on the parasols are ripping at the frame
The streetlights on the avenue are red
Oh, you couldn't ever see, it couldn't ever be
This couldn't ever happen but it did

This couldn't ever happen but it did
Streets are full of carnage and the avenues are red
Everybody waiting for the kid
This couldn't ever happen but it did

History is scratching on the windows of the past
Fighting on to see the light of day
We could've let it out, we could've let it out
We could have, but we never really did

Has life lost its thrill?
Used up all your will?
Can't take it any more
Dog pills

When drinkin's gotten old
Smoking leaves you cold
Where you gonna go?
Dog pills, Dog pills

Smoke weed every day
Adderal is OK
No one likes to shroom
Dog pills, dog pills, dog pills

Another bag of coke?
What is this, a joke?
Get in the other room
Dog pills, dog pills, dog pills, dog pills

I don't wanna, wanna leave the house
I just wanna, put them in my mouth
Just another boring day I guess
Guess I'm just a, just a human mess
Dog pills

Molly is such a bore
Every day is such a chore
I can't take it anymore
Dog pills, dog pills

When your heart is on attack
Your friends won't call you back
What is it you lack?
Dog pills, dog pills, dog pills

You're in such a funk
Maybe it's the junk

Dog pills, dog pills, dog pills, dog pills

I don't wanna, wanna leave the house
I just wanna, put them in my mouth
Just another boring day I guess

GOD! I AM! I CREATE! I CREATE!

My strength lies in my tenacity
I fear no hate
I am my own god!
I create my fate

Take all those feelings you've got bottled inside
Take them all out on whoever chose to stand by your side
You lash away, you make your way
Don't try to choose for myself

I wish no misery onto those who surround me
My span and reach is but my own
I show to all the same, and give the same
My hazardous touch serves and kills none but myself

For every blessing I give unto me, one more scar is torn
For each right decision I took, one has been faced with scorn
Yet not deterred, mine is a rose I have deprived of thorn
For each stab wound I inflict upon me, one more power is born

"
89200,"

Just one more
Piece of the puzzle
One more missing part
Of the big picture
I need focus
One small step
One step at a time
Crossroads, choices

It screams...
What i want
It screams...
WHAT THE FUCK DO I WANT?!

Screaming...
What i want
What i want
What i want
Shut this voice in my head

No remorse!
No going back
Don't hate myself no more
I've kept myself on track

This road i walk through
This dirt i leave behind
Every choice means leaving something behind
Every turn an abandoned path

No remorse!
No going back
Don't hate myself no more
I've kept myself on track

Throw out your fears
And live without regret
Throughout the years
You'll be able to forget

Or so they say
So they tell me to endure
My pain...
My pain has long asked for a cure

Something failing
Another system-wide crash
Nothing more
Than a piece of decadent flesh

I was born to lead
You were born to follow
Fancy look but inside
You're just plain and hollow

Why should I have
To play by your rules
And live my life following what you say
You are nothing more than me
I've made my own way

All my life I have struggled
Against the stops imposed on me
All the time breaking down walls
Rowing against a violent stream

Something failing
Another system-wide crash
Nothing more
Than a piece of decadent flesh

Here's her white skin turning red
Boy, this is going to hurt...
She never scared you much, until she crushed your face
Chained to words, here comes your pain

Hey, my silent fire!
You're killing my desire!
Hey, my silent fire!
It's time to get me higher

Underneath her skin, worms feeding
Keep digging, this shit will never end
You're in this together

Take it by the hand, eyes closed... you're the precious now
Her heart is pounding... cut it into pieces, build it over again

Hey, my silent fire!
You're killing my desire!
Hey, my silent fire!
It's time to get me higher

Something just too deep about your kiss
You're my bitch now baby!
I want you, reap it, thrust it...
I keep your secrets, wounded

Something just too perfect about your flesh
Just sometimes keep her from breaking apart, will you?

"
89208,
89210,"

I walk around, sticking needles in my brain
I try to stop, find a way to ease the strain
I can't control, can't control, I can't control it
No room, no rest, just constantly at test

My veins bursting, so full of hate
Fuck, is this really my own fate
Just a way to loose it all
This bad temper in the end'll be my downfall

Destroy! I cannot hold it
This rage inside is burning!
I break, I can't control it
Something snaps, I feel it hurting

"
89211,"

I look into the future
Blind man I am, it seems
Haunted by visions, despair
I live inside my dreams

I cannot create
I cannot vibrate
Overstimulate
My synapses
This is not me, the mirror lies
I cannot bear the weight, I cannot stand the size

I'm knee deep
In this misery
I'm knee deep
And I can't see

I feel divided
My wholeness I can't place
Lost in doubt
Between hatred and disgrace

Death awaits, the final mystery
Something new it will be
I wait for something no more
I found what searched for me

Outta my head it's glowing
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head things are different

I just gotta get out of my head a bit
Out of the negative. Out of the pessimist
Posture of doubt where everything's relative
And everyone is my nemesis. -- --
Yeah. I just gotta get out of my bed again
Get back in the game though I might never win
The fight might never end, and nothing is forever
Every day is heaven sent, and everything is better
When I'm out of my head. The second I'm stepping out
Whenever I look at you, the second I left the house
The scent of the fresh air; the wind that carries us
The feeling we'll get there - {Outta my head}
That's when we deal with what's real
Can't numb the pain. To heal I must feel
The hurt for a season, but it hurts for a reason
Done dreaming, now I'm searching for meaning
Out of my head

Outta my head things are different
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head
Outta my
Outta my head

[Verse 2]
I just gotta get out of my head a bit
Out of the negative. Out of the pessimist
Posture of doubt where everything's relative
And everyone is my nemesis. -- --
Yeah. I just gotta get out of my bed again
Look out my window. See through a better lens
Look up to the sky. Look up to better men
The bretheren are getting together. I'm getting
Outta my head. -- Not everyone gets to live
Death is definite. The rest ain't guaranteed
Life is a gift we get to give. The world
Is desperate for us. I can't let it get
Outta my head. -- I can't see truth
But I can see proof the world's not lost
Whenever I see you, I believe in the magic
I believe that we have it. See that trip?
Poof. I'm outta my head
And I'm glad to be alive. Glad to see the sky
The sun, I see it rise. The love I keep inside
Is why I need to rhyme. I need to breathe a sigh
And let it out

Outta my head things are different
Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head

[Intro: Eman/Claude Bégin]
T'étais là
J'étais là
(...)
J't'avais déjà dans l'oeil à l'école
T'étais là

J't'avais déjà dans l'oeil à l'école


[Verse 1: Claude Bégin]
Vide ton sac
Toutes les émotions
Pour éviter qu'on s'batte
Le plus p'tit
C'est le premier qui frappe
T'es miniaturisé
Tu vas décéder compacte
J'dois être né sur mars
J'ratte les farces
Y zont ben beau s'forcer
Mais ostie qui sont plates !
1984
On a perdu contact
Des amis, ça passe date
Faque faudrait vraiment qu'on s'check
Mon premier char
C'tait un ostie d'bon jack
Vieux Pontiac
Lâche ton chat
Tu m'étonnes ! man
Tu m'épates
Me semble que l'rap d'aujourd'hui
Est rendu wack
Biere noire mélangé du cidre pis toute
S'faire voir avec des p'tites pitounes
Attends-toi pas à tout s'qui saoule
La limite c'est l'ciel
Pis l'ciel ç'a pas d'boutte, come on !

[Pre-Chorus: Claude (Eman)]
T'as pas déjeuné
Mais tu souris quand même
(La plus belle fille de l'école est en jupe)
T'as à peine 15 cennes
Dans l'fond d'ton porte-monnaie
(T'as un billet pour les montagnes russes)
T'aurais voulu
Mais tu y parleras jamais
(La plus belle fille de l'école est en jupe)
Mais devine c'est qui
Qui vient s'asseoir à côté d'toi
Dans les montagnes russes

[Chorus: Claude Bégin]
Cours le bus
Les pieds dans sloche
Trouve un coin sec
Pour éteindre ta clope
Pis mets la dans ta poche

T'étais là (...)

Cours le bus
Les pieds dans sloche
Trouve un coin sec
Pour éteindre ta clope
Pis mets la dans ta poche
(J't'avais déjà dans l'oeil à l'école)

[Verse 2: Eman]
Yo
T'avais l'air trop cool
Partir en char, loafer ton cours
Que des cassettes originales dans ton Ford Contour
T'avais un Shockwave pis toute
Tu signais tes bulletins toi-même pis tu frappais des stools
J'me rappelle
C'est toi qui taggais fuck the school
T'échangeais ton argent du midi contre du toots
Après ça j'te voyais pu dans cour
Y t'ont changé d'école
Pass t'étais rendu s'aa poudre
Aide-moé
Y s'en fait pu des comme toé
C'est plate
Asteur tout l'monde s'échange des cartes de hockey
Les locaux vides parlent d'eux-même, chef
Sans toi, les profs ont pu d'matière
C'est pu pareil
J'me rappelle de toutes les fois les plus malades
Une alerte à la bombe pour pas faire un exam
En éduc c'tait tout l'temps toi qui faisait l'cave
À l'école c'tait cool
Même si j'ai coulé mon français d'4

[Pre-Chorus: Claude (Eman)]
T'as pas déjeuné

[Verse 1]
The lights are out, we are all alone
I'm standing in front of you
I'm running faster than I can tonight
It makes you feel alright
It makes you feel okay
We know that this is just a dream
An endless dream reminding me
Of all the bright lies we used to tell, but why?

[Bridge]
I wanna dream about pleasant things tonight
I wanna dream about things that make me smile
Things that make me feel okay

[Verse 2]
The time has moved again, you're on your own
Why don't you stay home
The nightmare's waiting in the yard
Cause after all, you're lost
Just expect the worst
Time is moving on and on
You're still alone
You're still alone

[Chorus]
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around
Things will turn around

"
89663,"

The mirrors in your eyes, the lights of my disguise
And after all we do describe what it feels to be just wrong

The closer that I get, the more I need to understand
What it feels to be the same, I’m just saint
I’m just saint all the time

The mirrors in your eyes, they fell like leaves off the dirty sky
And all the lights of my disguise keep on floating and floating
And floating and floating faster and so slower than I used to know
Then I used to know

Silence comes and goes, limits will be loose
Twisted smiles approach me like flowers from the sky (x3)

All the ships have been abandoned
All the ships have been abandoned

From my masted opaque deep the days go by
Seeing my beds empty half
I turned to fall from dark to darkness
What's it like to not have hands?
What's it like to not have hands?

All the ships have been abandoned
All the ships have been abandoned

"
90406,"

[Verse 1]
I prescribed myself a prone prolonged surrender
And proscribed my born role of friend and pretender
Abdicated agencys affirming splendor
And took to my bed a mind with which to render
A world in which I still felt tender

[Verse 2]
Confer upon this frail frame
A warrant for my given name
An agent I can justly blame
And a brain complacent and tame

[Verse 3]
And the prognosis is a slow descent
Of steadily increasing increments
Of liquor to the stomach of the sick

"
90408,"

[Verse 1]
Awakening, the fissures of my face separate
Forcing focus in below the weight of dreams and in their space
A frozen, fallow world awaits, beyond my hollow bed
To wrap my body up in violent shakes and cast my skull in dread
I mean to bathe to cleanse myself of sleeps subtle grace
But the chains, the chains, the chains, they hold me here in place
So I spend one more day in cotton grave, another day erased
One more day fully encased, another memory effaced

[Outro]
And I will not
Turn the key
Unlock these chains
Set free

"
90410,
90411,"

[Verse 1]
I am not sure of a world outside this wine
But if there is one then I am a bastard of it
Feel the embers warm my bones
In the wasteland that is west

[Verse 2]
The mountain man is a scary beacon
Decide what kind of martyrs we should grow
From the cedar table stands disgust
Of a chopped up sewer man
Impale them all and live like kings

Breaking up in tiny rooms
Suckling on the teat of space
In lucid fields I've come to pass
In the bottle I do see his face
Mother, have we come to terms
When our insides become unlaced
Knowing that it'll come to this
The absolute nothing black of space
Bloody trips in all the world
Walled up here like there's a race
Do walls mean we have mottled hearts?
Our will continues on the rays
Planets always moving out
Spreading at a steady pace

There won't be god, just blacker space

Ca y ressemble à se méprendre
Ca y ressemble à se défendre
Ca y ressemble à se répandre

Un moment érigé à la mémoire de notre incapacité
Les pierres à graver, vertes, écaillées demeurent nos paroles et regrets
De n'avoir pas su perpétuer, de ne plus savoir qui défier
Je veux pas tirer sur l'ambulance mais il y a peu de chances que ça change
Je ne veux pas croire qu'on ait laissé passer notre chance
Portée, gorgée des instants auto-couronnés. Chèrement fendu de combats au pistolet d'or
Humer les feux en restant désarticulé. Aussitôt dort, aussitôt mort...
C'est si chic de feindre l'indifférence
C'est si triste de voir comme on déchante
Un moment érigé, tout en haut contempler la somme de ce qui a échoué

"
90692,"

On pourrait tout se dire, ne plus médire, ne plus se mentir
On pourrait tout se dire et ainsi faire fi de toute convenance, cette ambivalence
Pour être heureux, faut être silencieux, et faire le jeu des moins courageux
On pourrait tomber les masques et voir en face la laideur de tout ce qu'il y a à l'intérieur
Mais pour une once de courage, des tonnes et des tonnes et des tonnes de culpabilité, de pudeur mal assumée
A manipuler les mots dans leur acception la plus vulgaire, tout le monde à souffert

"
90693,"

A travers des livres ouverts à des pages qui paraissent trop blanches
Dans la bouche, le goût amer des lendemains d'échéances
Quand l'envie se mêle à la fièvre, bousculer la logique des choses
Envisager tout ça comme un chemin de croix sans croix
Comme une traversée du désert et quelques besoins à satisfaire
Des pages à noircir, une histoire à se faire
Laissé des traversées vaines...

"
90694,
90695,"

Bien obligé de continuer à vivre
Malgré la sourde souffrance
Bien obligé déchelonner la peine
Une dette et pas de moyen de quittance
Pour se forcer à ne plus être hanté
Par la froideur dun début dhiver
Par lhorreur dun rendez vous funeste
Par le visage de tes pairs
Percuté par les mémoires
Et quest-ce que ça nous apprend?
Vivre sa vie comme on lentend
Si cest ce qui nous attend
Ne jamais perdre son temps
Et que tout ça serve au moins à quelque chose
Quelque chose dautre que faire pleurer nos mères

I'm dead and dank and rotten
My arms are wrapped in cotton
My corpse loves you, let's marry

Get smart, once - Every night at sleepy time
Get smart, twice - I hang my skin out on the line
Get smart, sing - Oh, darling, would you be, be mine

I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love, oh ho-ho-ho

I'm caught in a mesh of veins
My fingers and flesh and brains
My skull gives head, so let's wed

Get smart, once - Every night when all alone
Get smart, twice - I drape my flesh around the phone
Get smart, pray - Oh, darling, would you be my own

I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love, oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Don't cry, beautiful, it's just a phase
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I chant and I pray, I love
You know, God works in mysterious ways
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I sing and I pray, I love

I'm soft and slightly stinking
My arms are small and shrinking
My lips kiss dirt, oh, let's flirt

Get smart, once - Every night at half-past-one
Get smart, twice - There's a little taste of things in come
Get smart, chant - Oh, darling, can I be your son?

I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love, oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Don't scream, baby, it's just a coma
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I chant and I pray, I love
You go to heaven, I go to Roma
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I sing and I pray, I love

And the very thought of ruin
Distant this pain tonight
Nights like this will lift even
The heaviest of hearts
Go out and shed your death
Just let it fall right down
Endless fascination
How much will you hold

And no matter how you do it
It’s gonna turn out right
Of the stars above you
Which one heals your eye
Without memory to hang
You can lose yourself
As long as truth is with you
Your love will be good
Good love will kill it

Just another thrill discovery
There between each muse
One that shakes and one that takes
And one to give it all

Always act so put out

I don't wanna say sorry
For all the things i haven't done
I just wanna go back
To the way things were always done
With a hand held out to shake
And a word unbreakable
And a gaze straight as the miles
That cut the dirt
Grandma, i wanna go back
To the way things were always done
When you'd come down to find
Your man working the ground
With his hand held to the plow
And his back unbreakable
And his word as good as the gold
They found in those hills
But i'm not gonna go
I'm not gonna go
Back to the world i never knew
So tell me all your stories
About the way things were always done
Back before you knew me
And the world it maybe seemed young
Before your hands shook so much
And your voice so breakable
And your back bent
Lower than the willow by the woods
Because my handshake don't mean enough
And my word is breakable
And my back feels bent
Lower than than the willow by the woods
Than the willow

I drove away, far from the lake
I found the farmer's daughter
We could have been sisters if i were humble
Clothes muddy, red-cheeked and reticent
I looked around and wished that i could stay
And cover my head
Keep the fire going
Tuck the kids into bed
I know all the hymns
I'd say my prayers and close my eyes
To wake at dawn and do it all over again
So half in jest, i asked if i could stay, help milk the cows
Annie looked away and said just come back in an hour
Asking for more
We ask
We ask for more
For more
We ask
We ask for more
I drove away, back to the lake
Back to all my pretty, precious things - i put the milk away
I started to cry, put the music on to fill the quiet
Oh cluttered life - we try, we try, we try
Asking for more
We ask
We ask for more
Always for more
We ask
We ask for more
Holiest day break our nightmares in two
Holiest day shape our nightmares into threes
Holiest day break take our nightmares before we wake
We ask
We ask

I‘m in this something else around
Our madness and me
I’m not a pirate or a sadist
Just place the boy
I’m a sheep
...
The person that I want to be
It’s hot out there
But I don’t care
If you never mean
It’s all the time I spent
...better man
But it’s going to waste
Put it in my place
Buy yourself a dog
I wanna drown myself to sleep
Cause I don’t know what to do now
Taste the diff, I’m a chief
Taste the diff
Taste the diff
Taste the diff
Taste the diff
Taste the diff
Taste the diff
Taste the diff

And what do I do
Go to find
Head in the shadow
In the shadow of your step
What did you look at
(something kind of love)
Left me high
And what do I do
Go to find
Here in the shadow
In the shadow of your step
What did you look at
Let's have a love
Left me high

Chorus:
Tell me now how am I supposed to get used to
Constant shadows everywhere I go
Tell me now how I gonna make my way
Out there on the ever lonesome road
Tell me now how am I supposed to get used to
Constant shadows everywhere I go
Tell me how I gonna make my way
Out there on the ever lonesome road

Calm face, arms crossed, well let me in
White noise crawling through my skin
Chin up, honest to God, I won’t let you fall on your back
Back up, honest to God, I won’t leave on your own
Fond face, charms lost, well get me in

Proud intelligent you hold your tongue
Resolute a rabble on the run
If only they would let you have your fun
Your lion heart got emptied out at birth
The devil pumped it full of vile self worth
Intrepidly you made your way around the earth
And I’m not sure it’s fair
So fly me through the air
In the end I just don’t care
I’m hopping on the edge of something that I can’t feel nor witness through my own eyes
Damned intransigent you’re number one
Dissolute a rabbit with a gun
If only they would let you have your fun
Your righteous eye deletes itself at will
The dragon’s blood you took to save your ill
Candidly you make your way around the hill
And I’m not sure it’s fair
So fly me through the air
In the end I just don’t care
I’m hopping on the edge of something that I can’t feel nor witness through my own eyes
I’ll follow the call, the endless dawn, the soundless tapes you left in front of the telephone box and the countless locks I lost

"
91379,
91380,"

In the neon nest, I will shake my head
In the dead of day, when they’re wide-awake

On the neon branch, beneath the weather vane
I will take a stand, and they will understand

"
91381,"

My childhood, lopsided, crumbs, trouble, clear-sighted and leaning up
Against the Sellotape the apples back on while they were ripe, sticking to
Our story every time

We stood there, same mischief, same background, shame-chagrin with hands
Behind our backs and our eyes faced down. We'd celebrate the victory of
Buckets and doors, smiling all the way out the front door

How I longed to hold her hand, how I longed to touch her face, how I longed
To hear a sound, come from that phone, from far across the town

That night when all went to hell I thought we'd never see the thorns pulled
Out of our poor old toes. We'd imitate the noises that we thought we should
Make, howling at the wind and our mistakes

How I longed to touch her hand, how I longed to see her face, how I longed
To hear a sound, come from that voice, from far across the land

"
91382,"

It's not the same, as it was, the last time I was here, there were hedges
And cars
There were people in their homes saying prayers

And through the fog, late at night, we would walk and we'd sing and give
The kids a real fright. And go back home really late and steal some gin

We're second rate, our odds aren't great, with no fortunes and no shares
And no ring to our names
But our words have been sharpened and we're out for blood

And our hearts have been misplaced in a secret location
And we'll leave them there for a while as we try to save this sweet, loving
Nation
Softly tear it's heart, softly tear it's heart, softly tear it's heart

"
91383,"

I was crushed by a forty-foot man. I didn't understand. I didn't see his
Hand
I saw the cracks in the palm of his hand, as he squashed my head, as the
Soulless giant said...

I was lost in the cruelest of realms, when I saw your print and the little
Drops of ink
That you left by the side of the road, where the elephants rode, where the
Orphan birds were sold

I will follow your scent to the end, to the end of this page, to the start
Of my old age
And when the souls in the know concur, I will eat your stress and we'll be
Done with this mess

"
91384,
91386,"

So I am, held up again, by a demon's door
I check the clock and it's all ticked off as it's shadow paints the floor
My fallback plan didn't turn out sound but I see a way out
Damn those eyes and those gormless dice, and the cars dished out

I hold my breath till the second gong and put the silver files back in the
Drawer
Oh my lord, give me a second chance, give me a few more bars and a sword

A soldier's truth in a silent room doesn't need more light
The highlight of a day at work, I sell my soul to suit myself and the rats
Dress nice

Take my hand, close your eyes and pray
Take a summersault through the day
Lift up that chin, let the light back in
Let the tears from your pen and the drops from eyes circle in

"
91387,"

Such a rage, you inspired
Like we're hauling land through the air
Like the selfish men, we enquired
Like the falling tree, we're not there

And there's something in your eyes
Like there's a Molotov inside
And the fools will have your gold
And throw sticks until you're old

Coming out to get you, setting up a trap
You dive, you dive, you dive, you dive
Jumping over mountains, running over fire
You hide, you hide, you hide, you hide

Such a rage, you inspired
Like we're hauling land through the air
Like the selfish man, I'm tired
Like the falling tree, I wasn't there

And there's something in your eyes
Like there's a Molotov inside
And the fools will have your head
And throw stones until you're dead

Count your stars, kick the tires
Kill two birds, with your eyes
Gather time, in your mind
Count to three and start again
Hold the truth in your arms
Make a wish on your terms
Kick the saints from your town
Count to three and start again

I'm tired...

"
91388,"

I will put my life on tape and hide it in a hole in the ground, safe and
Sound
And if there's nothing left to play it on when life has worn me down, well
I won't mind
I will keep the rest on disc and put you at the top of my list, you get the
Gist
And if there's no room left to store it on when life has torn me down
Well, I won't mind

Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come
Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come

I will take what I can take and store it in the front of my mind, and hold
Up time
I will carve myself in stone, and drive you to the end of the road, and put
You on the walls of my home

I will scrape what I can scrape, and hide it in the back of my mind, and
Carry it around with me while...
While the sand pulls hard on time and kills us for the time of it's life
Well, I won't mind

Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come
Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come

I stand close just close enough to see
Your eyelids close and shutter up in front of what you see
He pulls his gun and holds it up in fear
Gladly there is no one left to back him up in here
Your soul's an asylum, just like the 90's were
This world is an island at my door
I stand close just close enough to touch
His arm as he walks by bearing those solid rusty cuffs
His eyes say no i'm innocent I swear
But I smell fear and feel his guilt inside that lonely stare
My heart is an island off the coast of you, I'll follow you trail until I find you
I reason with him, hold the picture, up at him but nothing seems to work
My heart is an island, just off the coast of you, and i'll follow your trail until it takes we to you

"
91390,"

Salutary tongues that speak in turn. Waiting for their chance to make us
Yearn
The sounds and emotions spreading thin, we'll sink the float that would not
Let us win
A solitary cheer that does not work. We cottoned on to all their taints and
Quirks
And fled to the mountains on a whim, watching all the mess behind us sink
And that's no way to listen to our sonnet
They're buzzing like a bee inside my bonnet
But the fools never listen to what I say
They've copied all their lines into a prayer

Fools, don't listen to a word I say. Just look the other way
I'm not saying I've got much to say. Just look the other way

"
91391,"

A drop of ink on a yellow leaf
Blows up a tank on a page-less book
I see a shrine of their shameless belief
Swallowed whole by a scrupulous crook

And I'm not time, not doing time, for a gaunt clue stuck in the sky
And I'm not time, not doing time, not doing time

We're saving up for Sundays
That's when the owls come out and sing
Following the sundown
Happy to see the darkness rule again
(Again) we hide the wide smile
That's 'cause our teeth don't like the air
Hurry through the wild spot
Happy to see the Daylight come again

And we're still saving up for Sundays
That's when the owl came out to play
Following the sun-down
Happy to see the darkness rule again
(Again) we hide the sad smile
That's because our teeth don't like the air
We hurry through the wild spots
Happy to see the Daylight come again

"
91392,"

Convulsive state away from files of tricks they hide from our unholy eyes
We start to home these stalks and wicked unread books whose sun will burn those lies
All rise to the hum of sadness and sighs

Emulsive state in play I see no need to hide from their unworthy eyes
I start to slur my talks and vivid unsaid thoughts whose sun will burn those ties

The false side of hope, back up your soul

All rise to the hum of sadness and sighs

The false side of hope, back up your soul
The false side of hope, back up your soul

"
91393,"

Home, surround the halo
Held up to a clear night sky
Smiling at the moon
Roll over
Soon, become the hero
Down beyond the orbit of your sight
Roll over
Roll over
Roll over soon
Roll over
Roll over soon

Gently moving, scarcely born
Sitting back to front on the top of the moon
I say it's not happening and I'm falling asleep
Something has to budge before the end of the week

And I smile expressionlessly
And I smile expressionlessly

"
91394,"

Sawn off shot home
No one left to mop up
Bright-eyed dull look
The joke's on your book

Standoff nearby
A storm on it's way to look
Storm-eye sulking
The joke's on your book

The sounds are like a calling, like an urging, like the screaming of the prey you watched in awe for hours in the previous life

We'll get our fists out, 'cause there is nothing coming out of this hopeless southern call
I'll show my wrist low, before their empty guts, there's something going foul

We'll get our fists wet, 'cause there is nothing coming out of this hopeless southern call

91395,"

Swamp stewing in the grass
Where you wept
You wipe your fingers clean of the tears
Your dry eyes for all to see
Salty and blind
And open wide

Grab a chair and catch a read
Of your life and where it leads
This story reveals this side of you
The one you wished you never knew

In this storm shore home
Safe and secure
In a mutant roar I follow you home
With dry eyes for all to see
Salty and blind
And open wide
Safe and secure

With dry eyes for all to see
With dry eyes for all to see
With dry eyes for all to see
With dry eyes for all to see
Dry eyes for all to see

91396,"

Don't pick up, the fifth will be the last
I know you know, our time has been a blast
Don't pick up, it's too late
Don't be scared I'll be home soon

I have a mission for you, the clues are in your arms
I'm sure gonna miss you, the keys are in the jar

Don't pick up, it's too late
Don't be scared I'll be home soon

"
91398,"

I slip into your gown, and sleep until it's noon
And I hold that thought for hours, before holding up the moon
I slip into your home, and sleep until it's late
And I hold that head for hours, before getting out of state

Drop high, don't stow away heartache
Don't run away until a fifth of the walls hit their mark
Grow shy, don't steal away keepsakes
Don't run away until the fourth of the horses has marched

Glowing cold, glowing old, glowing time
Brought the seal of a kiss of a fallback light
Laughing out, breathing in, holding time
Sit on back, open arms at a foreign light

I'll watch for a sudden chime of all the better times ahead
And bang the nails into the door, and cross the stars around my head
And if God's a state of mind, I think I'll split and live in the country
All that noise, all that noise, sizzling in the background every time

Glowing cold, glowing old, glowing time
Brought the seal of a kiss, on a wall, of a fallback light
Laughing out, breathing in, holding time
Sitting back in a chair, open arms at a falling kite

And the words you bought run on ice
And the words you bought run on ice
And the words you bought run on ice
And the words you bought run on ice

An old man in a frame, throwing eyes at me in a vain, and he cries himself awake
While a big sister in a train, says 'i am never coming back', and she cries herself awake
A great uncle hits the screen, exit hope and all his dreams and they cry themselves awake
Christmas comes and goes for good, the words I lost, the ones I misunderstood, I cry myself awake

Could you ask yourself?

Baby I love it when you come home
And make love to me like
You've seen something new
Baby I love it when you fold my clothes
And tuck them into cabinets
Send me off to work like that

Baby I don't know how you can happen to be so fine
I see him on the regular
He ties my heart in knots just like polish sausages
I never understand why some people
Insistently don't know how to love

Could you ask yourself the reason why?

I would like to know a couple of things about you
But I'm afraid to ask
I prefer to keep pretending
You are the sweet thing I made you out to be

I would like to gather up a couple of good sticks
And build you a nest
And lay you an egg
Straight into your mouth

Everything that I dream
I wanna see in front of me
Please take me away
I know I can sleep when it's over
Sunshine is all I see
Life running over me
I've found everything I need
And now I can dream
Walk a little more
Until we find what we're looking for
I'm alive in this place
I only feel love
I do not hate
Sunshine is all I see
Life running over me
I've found everything I need
And now I can dream
Sometimes I never want to hear the things I've heard before
I'll take a trip to find way to risk it
Life is such a bore
And when I come back I'll be ageless as before
Never met so many people
I'm awake and I feel
Too far gone
Tired of this noise around me
This sound is all I ever hear
So i escape, away from this place
Its not too late
Sunshine is all I see
Life running over me
I've found everything I need
And now I
Sometimes I never want to hear the things Ive heard before
II'll take a trip to find a way to risk it
Life is such a bore
And when I come back I'll be
Ageless as before

You're a billionaire with a shotgun
And you feel it in the back of your throat
Maybe it's the lonely nights or the days gone by

You know where you got to go
So you hit the streets for a midnight
Stroll or just a breathe of fresh air
There's a siren sound up the avenue
And the street light color is neon blue
What got in to you?
In a hurricane with a baseball bat
Three strikes you're out
Storm keeps rolling on the window panes with the ladies flying out
So you hit the streets for a midnight
Stroll or just a breathe of fresh air
There's a siren sound up the avenue
And the street light color is neon blue
What got in to you?

I can't wait
I've got a problem in my head

No you can't help me, not you guys
But all you sweet girls, with your sweet talk
I've got a problem in my head
Rather end up dumb than end up dead

You should be brave when you go out
My shadow looms above this town

If I let you stand inside of me
Could you learn to walk, could you learn to breathe?
Or would you shield your eyes from the ugly things that bare their teeth and beat their wings?
Hold fast to the ray, that slips past the falling rain. Keep your dream ’neath your hat, and the wind on your back
Day breaks, cock crows, earth quakes, night glows
Flowers wilt, love dies, snow melts, sun shines. Oh my, oh my
Well the past is still the past you can visit anytime
Nothing’s really changed except a few road signs
Well it’s quiet ’round here and we like it that way. So don’t go sniffing ’round a newly dug grave
Hold fast to the ray, that slips past the falling rain. Keep your dream ’neath your hat, and the wind on your back
Day breaks, cock crows, earth quakes, night glows
Flowers wilt, love dies, snow melts, sun shines. Oh my, oh my

Wayward son, where are you heading?
Your fire burns, soon it will be setting
Wounded like a plane with one wing
Darling, to kiss your affliction on the sea
You spun a wheel and laid it all on a wager
Then your fist, are you walking papers?
Now smile, please, upon your lips
And I'll lay something that you can't resist
You're on your own, without a moment's rest
While your heart pounds against your chest
In the twilight you wait to hear the whispering of the waves
Washed up like a castaway
Washed up like a castaway
Dismal day, tumbles like a clown
Just in time to peel yourself from the ground
Like a snake, you can slip from your skin
Oh, to blow from town to town like a gipsy or a whim
Golden boy, where is your Midas touch?
For everything around you has turned to dust
Now you're live in fear of the hand
Would you come and turn it all on your palaces?
You're on your own, without a moment's rest
While your heart pounds against your chest
In the twilight you wait to hear the whispering of the waves
Washed up like a castaway
Washed up like a castaway

Are you ready to kill

But most remain unfulfilled

You are the coffee cup, not the hand

You are the curse, not the land

And suddenly all at once my legs won't let me stand

I scratch till my fingers go numb
But my skin never bleeds
A silent accomplice waits and feeds when I'm asleep

There's something that lives inside me
I promise I never let it in
It grows and divides inside me
It's making a home beneath my skin

The seeds have been buried deeply
The roots are in place
It's crowding the sun and it's darkened my days

I've taken it all for granted
But now it's too late
There's nothing that's left to do but wait

Running in the sand
Living on the land
The salty breeze was in our eyes
We stood beneath the dragonflies and danced all night

We polished all the chrome
On our rusty little home
We slept all night in parking lots
We tied our hearts in double knots, so tight
So free, so right

Remember when
We were just cherubs in our tender skin
Waiting patiently for life to begin

Flowing so free
Blowing in the breeze
The songs we sung so long ago
With whiskey and an afterglow, we shined like new

But there along the way
Something seemed to change
As weeks turned into months we knew
As life caught up we slowly grew, apart
And untied our hearts

Remember when
We were just cherubs in our tender skin
Waiting patiently for life to begin

The summer went away and the skies went gray
We slowly ran out of things to say
The river turned into drought
Our time was fading out

Defeated and alone, we returned back home
Like a bird without a wing who had never flown
Surrendered to, suspended dreams

Remember when
You walked away in the December wind
I felt the stinging on my pale skin
I knew that things would never be the same again

Remember when
The clouds rolled in and then the sunlight dimmed
And what will be, it killed what might have been

Veering forthright, toward nothingness

The ceaseless waves, they will rend and shake us
They'll bend and break us, until we quit

So lay me down, and let me fall apart
We're lost at sea, without a chart
Wake me, if we should crash ashore
But I refuse to steer her anymore

We float alone through this virgin ocean
The surging motion, a fate resigned

My bones are weak, slowly decomposing
The sea is closing down my mind

So lay me down, and let me fall apart
We're lost at sea, forget the chart
Wake me, if we should crash ashore
But I refuse to steer her anymore

No hope to lose, No hope to lose
The infinite horizon wraps around us like a noose
But hangs so loose

Wake me, if we should crash ashore
But I refuse to steer her anymore

You turn and walk away

But I will try and dry your eyes and fix the scattered parts
Yeah, I will learn to mend your troubled heart
Yeah, I will learn to mend your troubled heart

The last bus is leaving, but you're on the curb
You wanted to run but you're lacking the nerve
And motionless standing, you can't find a word

The tail lights are fading, your feet on the ground
Your bags, like an anchor, are weighing you down
You're moored to the future, you're stuck in this town

You turn to your left and I'm standing alone
With a numbness that's lingering deep in my bones
And it looks like you're gonna be coming back home

And there for a moment we're caught in a stare
The city just stops while it hangs in the air
I once would have saved you, but now I don't care

So I turn around and go
And I turn around and go

Take another way, take another way, take another way, take another way
Take another way home
Take another way, take another way, take another way, take another way
Take another way home

I spent so long just wandering
For years I was adrift
Directionless and wayward lost
Like a swallow on a cliff

But slowly I found purpose
And my life became more clear
I found my destination
But now, where to go from here?

Cuz I'm already there, I'm already everywhere

I've got a wife, two kids and a picket fence
Everything was hazy, now it's making sense
Alright, I made it, so now what?

I paid my dues in factories
I worked until I bled
The suffering made me stronger
So I pushed to get ahead

Now I'm perched above the factory floor
Looking down at my friends below
In my comfy car I drive away
But there's nowhere left to go

Cuz I'm already there, I'm already everywhere

I've got a wife, two kids and a picket fence
Everything was hazy, now it's making sense
Alright, I made it, so now what?

No one ever told me
That when the race is done
The finish line's behind you
And you have lost, or you have won

The crowd goes home and you're still standing
On that empty track
The lights are off, the crowd is gone
And there's no turning back

Cuz You're already there, You're already everywhere
I'm already there, I'm already everywhere
I'm already there, I'm already everywhere

I learned to walk when I was one
Beneath the Oklahoma sun
And from that day, I started taking my own route
I learned to read when I was two
And I believed it all was true
Too young to fill my mind with questions and with doubt

I made my first friend when I was three
But by four, he moved away so very far from me
At five I wondered why, people live and people die
And why the things I loved just slowly slipped away from me
And only stars remained the same

Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
We're together on our own

I said goodbye when I was ten
To Santa Claus and all his friends
I had to leave those childish stories all behind
But when they told me god was real
I just couldn't help but feel
This burning question that was tugging on my mind

By the time I was eleven, I had given up on heaven
And everything was falling into place
I kept my mouth shut, so I wouldn't rock the boat
Because a kid who's fallen overboard is just too ashamed to float
And still the stars remained the same

Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
We're together on our own

I learned to walk, when I was one
Without a crutch to lean upon
I had to relearn everything
My legs were weak without the wings

But I'm stronger now, my mind is free
Controlling my own destiny
When I write the final chapter
That's the last you'll read of me

Today I went to see a friend
His days are almost at an end
The doctors say he's got a month or two to live
He called to me there from his bed
And with a weakening voice he said
""If there's no god, then tell me what the hell's the point?""

I didn't have an answer, so I looked at him and said
You were always giving love, you could have taken it instead

This journey may be pointless, but at least I sure can say
You made it better for the rest of us you passed along the way
And still the stars remain the same

Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
We're together on our own

Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
We are not alone
Cold night, starlight
We are not alone
We're together on our own

The last remains of Pompeii burned
The gadabout had just returned
To see the ashes covering the town

Empires burned and cities fell
While lovers kissed and said farewell
And laid their fragile bodies on the ground

But I'm not scared to burn
To dust, I will return again
If you'll stay by my side
I'll lay down and I won't hide from fate

Vesuvius was growing colder
Embers that had hotly smoldered
Settled into lifeless dust below

The gadabout was still alive
But not another soul survived
So through the blackened streets he walked alone

But I'm not scared to burn
To dust, I will return again
If you'll stay by my side
I'll lay down and I won't hide from fate

The centuries will come and go
The sun will shine, the wind will blow
And we will curse the passing of the years

But time's eternal, day by day
It's us who pass, and blow away
Soon no one will remember we were here

But I'm not scared to burn
To dust, I will return again
If you'll stay by my side
I'll lay down and I won't hide from fate
From fate

92185,"

I didn't want to take your honor away
You're just another toy to me
Discarded prey and I

I didn't want to hear you crying today
But everything is what it is
And you won't stay in pain for long
No, you are strong

Please, I'm down with a bad disease
You're torn and holy
My mind, is swimming in turpentine
Dissolving slowly

You shivered like an earthquake shaking your heart
You crack a fissure, exposing every inch of your
Deepest part, and I

I didn't mean to make you crumble apart
But you have got a life a head
So go and start to cauterize
Your wounded cries

Please, I'm down with a bad disease
You're torn and holy
My mind, is swimming in turpentine
Dissolving slowly

(one, two, three, four)

Please, I'm down with a bad disease
You're torn and holy

Dissolving slowly

92186,"

Your fingers tapping on the table
My feet are bouncing on the floor
I haven't slept for 40 hours, and I will wait for 40 more
Until the last shot of the war

They say the waiting is the worst part
I only hope that that's the case
But I won't let a single instant or a moment or go to waste
To watch a memory erased

Hold on
Hold on
'Cause I don't have the time to wait
No, I don't want to be too late

Your face is burned into my memory
I've traced the lines so carefully
I've memorized the hills and valleys
And the freckles on your cheek
The way you smile in your sleep

You told me nothing lasts forever
But I won't let you fade away
As time begins it's slow destruction, the inescapable decay
The colors bleaching into grey

Hold on
Hold on
'Cause I don't have the time to wait
No, I don't want to be too late

"
92187,"

The TV man spoke of death on some coast
I saw all the crumbling debris
It dealt me a blow, but I'm thankful to know
That it could never happen to me

I am standing on motionless land
A constant under my feet
I've got four walls and a roof overhead
It could never happen to me

I feel for the poor folks who wander the streets
In search of their daughters and sons
It's sad there are people with nothing to eat
I'm thankful I'll never be one

I've worked for my family and home
My whole life I fought to be free
No one deserves to be homeless, alone
But it could never happen to me

I've lived my life, righteous and wise
And chosen my path carefully
Someone just has to be smiling on high
Cuz this could never happen to me

No I'm not without flaws, and I've suffered through loss
I've got problems that weigh on my mind
I've got bills to pay, and a son on the way
So I've got to save every time

These things always happen so far from my door
As if tragedy lives overseas
I wish I could help, but I'm glad for myself
That it could never happen to me
That it could never happen to me

Well the dream's in the ditch
Now the kids are all pissed
But it's not new to hate what they make you do

First they pull all your teeth
Then they'll want you to eat
Well get over it kid, you don't want any part in it

But it's not the way you can't afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

Is this it
This is it

So they paid you to scream
But it buried your dreams
So you wait for the pain that will send you to sleep again

Now you walk with your wolves
Like you got nothing to lose
Act like you don't care while you pray for a cross to bear

But it's not the way you can't afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

The last time she took the last step of the day she couldn't return home
A thoughtless way to get anywhere but the place you want to be
""A loveless revelation will soon come to me""
We're barefoot to the world of broken glass
Her arch torn and conveying the past
""I'm never going back to that life again
Because it's the longest one
The death of me.""
Tripping up on every crack in the pavement
We're humbled by failure and defined by an unkown greatness
""For every moonlit sky, for the day I disappear into nothing.""
Like her, we're so unsure if we can ever return
Her moonlit sky is our guide
We search to survive
We're barefoot to the world of broken glass
Bleeding for a love that lasts

To each other, biologically
To the earth, chemically
To the rest of the universe atomically

I think nature's imagination
Is so much greater than man's
She's never going to let us relax

[Verse 1: Carl Sagan]
We live in an in-between universe
Where things change all right
But according to patterns, rules,
Or as we call them, laws of nature

[Verse 1: Bill Nye]
I'm this guy standing on a planet
Really I'm just a speck
Compared with a star, the planet is just another speck

[Pre-Chorus: Bill Nye]
To think about all of this
To think about the vast emptiness of space
There's billions and billions of stars
Billions and billions of specks

[Chorus: Carl Sagan]
The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
But the way those atoms are put together
The cosmos is also within us
We're made of star stuff
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself

[Post-Chorus: Carl Sagan]
Across the sea of space
The stars are other suns
We have traveled this way before
And there is much to be learned

I find it elevating and exhilarating
To discover that we live in a universe
Which permits the evolution of molecular machines
As intricate and subtle as we

I know that the molecules in my body are traceable
To phenomena in the cosmos
That makes me want to grab people in the street
And say, have you heard this?

[Verse 3: Richard Feynman]
There's this tremendous mess
Of waves all over in space
Which is the light bouncing around the room
And going from one thing to the other

And it's all really there
Really, really there
But you gotta stop and think about it
About the complexity to really get the pleasure

And it's all really there
Really, really there
The inconceivable nature of nature

So, what are we really made of?
Dig deep inside the atom
And you’ll find tiny particles
Held together by invisible forces

Everything is made up
Of tiny packets of energy
Born in cosmic furnaces

The atoms that we’re made of have
Negatively charged electrons
Whirling around a big bulky nucleus

Evolution - the greatest show on Earth

There is grandeur in this view of life

The history of life can be thought of
As a many branched tree

were established early on

Bacteria
Protists- amoeba like creatures
Fungi
Plants
And animals

We find ourselves perched on one tiny twig
In the midst of a blossoming tree of life

We are surrounded by millions of other species
Walking, flying, burrowing, stalking, chasing, fleeing,

Animals strive to reach this one ultimate goal
To ensure the survival of the next generation
This one ultimate goal
To pass on their genes
That is what life is all about

Why do the stars shine?
Why does the galaxy light up?

E equals MC squared
That is the engine that lights up the stars

Now listen carefully:
The faster you move
THe heavier you get
The energy of motion turns into M, your mass

Energy equals Mass times the speed of light squared
An awful lot of energy
For a tiny amount of mass

Light travels at the same speed
No matter how you look at it
No matter how I move, relative to you,
Light travels at the same speed

[Neil DeGrasse Tyson]
No matter who is doing the measurement
And no matter what direction you are moving
The speed of light is the same
No matter what direction, or how fast

As you travel faster
Time slows down
Everything slows down

Time slows down when you move
Time passes at a different rate
Clocks run slow

A planet like the Earth is kept in orbit

Now all of this is illustration of the fact

[Verse 3:C-Bo]
(Murder)
See, I'm a G from the block and when there's funk it's on (it's on)
I'll be the nigga with a strap to your homies dome
Headbuttin'
Crushing them bones
With that HK, Buck 'em (Buck Buck Buck Buck)
Sittin' that ass down
Retaliatin' be some out of state negroes (negroes)
Decapitate and leaving afros in steel toes (steel toes)
Some more hardcore killers (killers)
Balling dope dealers(dope dealers)
Klu Klux [?]
The real deal'ah
Bailing your hood like thrillah
You're either killa, or vacator get killed by the killa
Now what do you prefer?
It's best that you disperse
Or be the next verse

[Hook]


[Verse 4:C-Bo]
Now here comes the big gangster
Hopping out the regal
Pants sagging,Fat pockets eagle (fat pockets)
Fifty Cali style
Stacking up G's by the pound
Sipping amaretto (amarretto)
Packing a throwaway beretta
And been in it to win it since the beginning
So when I pose took the slugs with my .44 leaving niggas froze
It's fuck you ho's in the mind of a psycho
Kicking off rides when the lights go
I did my time on the cell block for selling rocks
I'd rather let the cops shell shock then get popped
So next time I'll protect mine with my tec-9
Having wreck time
They can't check mine

[Hook]

I never thought I'd see the day
I thought that I had finally moved along
And I had let you go so long ago, so long
This is not, this is not where I belong

So I wait for this shallow itch to pass
And I wait, yeah I wait

Hey hey, I'm ok
I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
What's yours and mine
Oh oh, I don't know
What I was ever hoping I would find
But it's time for me to leave this all behind

I don't regret a single thing
I couldn't say it didn't feel alright
But I don't want to stay and I don't want to fight
All alone, with my foolish appetite

So I wait for this shallow itch to pass
And I wait, yeah I wait

Hey hey, I'm ok
I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
What's yours and mine
Oh oh, I don't know
What I was ever hoping I would find
But it's time for me to leave this all behind

I don't have the heart to give away to you again
I don't have the stomach for it, no one ever wins
We had our fun but I have sung this song to you before
Here's my last refrain

Hey hey, I'm ok
I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
What's yours and mine
Oh oh, I don't know
What I was ever hoping I would find
But it's time for me to leave this all behind

Hey hey, I'm ok
I do not need this anyway, I'm fine
What's yours and mine
Oh oh, I don't know
What I was ever hoping I would find
But it's time for me to leave this all behind
Leave it all behind

"
92720,"

I took a wrong turn
A thousand miles back
But I let it go so long ago
I threw away the map

I should have known where I was going
And I should know where I am
It's a different place, a different face, a different name
But somehow the same

It's like a lost and found
And when I turn around
It's 20/20

Well, the fog was wrapped around me
It settled in for years
But now the day has pushed it all away
My mind is getting clear

So I followed all the breadcrumbs, oh
And I tried to find the track
But I can't return, that bridge was burned
The first time I went past but I keep looking back

It's like a lost and found
And when I turn around
It's 20/20

I don't regret what hasn't happened
But I wonder what would be
It's only memories I'll never see
And places I won't go and curiousity

It's like a lost and found
And when I turn around
It's 20/20

And if I knew it then
I wouldn't run again
It's 20/20

"
92721,"

I left in the dead of the new moon's veil
I clung to the side of the camouflaged trail
I was over the river before the sky was awake

I kept my ear pressed to the transistor radio
This station was all I had left from my little home
I don't want to leave but this sorrow was all I could take

A static-y voice through the crackling speaker
Has followed me all the way here
The longer I go, we both will get weaker
Till one of us just disappears

I don't want to go but my duty is stronger than fear

I worked 20 years without nothing to show
So I left behind everything that I've known
In the hope that my family won't need to go hungry again

The stopped me the last time I tried this migration
I'm the overflow man in this melting pot nation
But the only thing here in this desert is a northerly wind

I'm not really sure where the oxygen's going
But it followed me all the way here
The line on the map didn't stop it from blowing
It's free, and that one thing is clear

I don't want to go but my duty is stronger than fear

And the sun, it doesn't care
If it's here, or if it's over there
It just passes through the stratosphere
Until it goes away

I once watched a sparrow fly south for the winter
Her feathers were thin, and her body was thinner
But we had enough there to feed her until she was well

The seasons are cycles, they go back and forth
One day it's south and the next it is north
The just need a little relief till the snow starts to melt

Today she's returning to look for her nest
And she's followed me all the way here
With nothing to hold but the meat on her breast
And the promise of one more year

The radio man is still playing his songs
But the signal is not quite as clear
I'd rather be back at the place I belong
But my family is needing me here

I don't want to go but my duty is stronger than fear
I don't want to go but my duty is stronger than fear

"
92722,"

I saw you drowning in a paper cup
And I just watched as you went down
You didn't seem to know which way was up
You just watched the world go around

The water swirled and it tugged at your feet
Your little private hurricane
And as you teetered on the edge of defeat
I could almost hear you calling my name

Oh, did you believe what I said
That I'm never gonna see you again
Don't let me follow you into this disease
I won't let you win

I could have reached a hand to carry you out
I could have jumped in on my own
But if you're gonna let yourself fall down
You'll be going to the bottom alone

This ship is sinking and there's no way out
You are the captain, I guess that you're trapped in, but I
I don't know you, I don't owe you anything

"
92723,"

I took some bread to him today
He was awake, but he wouldn't take it

He's getting frailer every day
Tied to the chair, under the stairs

But death is not a friend he's ever gonna meet
As long as I am here, he's staying in that seat
And he's gonna pay, in every way

The night he broke into her home
He thought he was strong, but god he was wrong

Now he's naked and alone
Scarred and abused, battered and bruised

It's only been a year but I have just begun
As long as I am here, I never will be done
Yeah, he's gonna pay, in every way

Nothing in the world could ever pay his debt
But I am gonna get as close as I can get
Yeah, he's gonna pay, in every way

"
92724,"

Lean back and swallow the key to your heart
You're hiding in your shallow skin
And you're never gonna let me in

You've had a parachute on from the start
I know you wanna break your fall
But are you feeling anything at all?

Everybody feels alone
Everybody's on their own
I wanna see the stars collide
I wanna see the burning sky inside you

You wear a permanent smile on your face
But you're bleeding from the inside out
And you'll never say what it's about

But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know that it's a lie
That you never told me
But I guess you sold me all the same

Chorus

And I, I wanna go blind
And I, I want you to blind me
Just give me a sign

Don't go and tell me you don't want to know
That I'm better off in the dark
That you'll always be a shooting star

Cuz I know, yeah I know, yeah I know that it's a lie
You shouldn't told it
But I'll never hold it over you

Chorus

"
92725,"

Your secret's out, but you don't wanna know what it was all about
You close your eyes, you are warm and wrapped inside of your disguise

Grey snow, falling on your window in the night

You let me in, I thought this sleeping dream was ready to begin
But then you froze, and shut me out and left me naked in the snow

Secrets, why do you believe this?
You just wanna tell yourself what you already know
Secrets, why'd you never see this?
Everything was there beneath your careless little nose

Oh, in your darkest dreams
No one ever wants you, no one ever needs you
Oh, it's a cold, bitter, broken lie
No one ever knew you

"
92726,"

The lights are out, the shades are down
He's got his scepter and his crown

He's waking up, and all alone
He's sinking in the cushions of his throne

But all the gold in Macedon
Couldn't turn his head

He never saw the downfall coming
And he probably never cared

The king was overthrown
But he didn't even know it

He once was strong, he once was loved
He lifted everyone above

But his arms got tired, from the heavy load
And he was breaking under all the weight below

He sat down to take a breath
But never stood back up

And everthing was fine without him
So he just let it go

The king was overthrown
But he didn't even know it

He never even knew that he was done
He never even saw the setting sun fall down

He's living in the corners of his mind
The only thing alive was there behind his crown

No one had the heart to tell him that his time was through

"
92727,"

Don't let me take too long here
I've got a lot of things to do
These days are passing by me
I'm staring blindly at the view

I woke up one day older
Just like ten thousand days before
And all at once I'm hearing
A quiet knocking on my door

Lost chances, sideways glances
I will let them be without me
Creation, celebration
I will let them pass me by, and
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
But all I see is loss and pain, so screw it

Once I was star-eyed shining
Now I'm buzzing like a neon sign
That's missing half its letters
And it's getting dimmer all the time

Bells ringing, choirs singing
I will let them be without me
Moonshine and cherry wine, yeah
I will let them pass me by again

Wake and sleep and drink and eat and work until I've thrown the day away
Yesterday was once tomorrow, now it's just another fading day

"
92728,"

No one hears them, only you
The voices never speak in the light
They're in the corner, out of sight, and oh
They're only fleeting little whispers
And the creeping little shivers
And they're sleeping till the sun burns out
Then they're going to scream and shout

Hold your breath and count to 10
Remember that it's all in your head
If you let them in, they'll breed and spread and oh
You gotta take them, gotta break them
Gotta shake them, gotta make them heave and stutter
Till they're all burned out
You gotta drive them out

"
92729,"

I was a soldier boy in the twilight of my youth
When I still could feel love and a trust in above for the truth
I fought with bravery, then I left my gun behind
But the misery I've seen never wiped itself clean from my mind

Now I never, ever close my eyes completely
When I'm sleeping...

I barely recognize the people that I knew
The faces the same and I still couldn't name but a few
If god isn't dead, then I'll kill him myself
Cuz I've seen the worst, I'm not scared to just burst into hell

Now I never, ever close my eyes completely
When I'm sleeping, I'm not dreaming

I built this house but it fell down before I got one night of sleep
So how does that beat all the fools who never tried
They missed the moon in rented rooms,
traded stories over food
I worked alone, broke my bones with all my pride

I desired royal attire, so I acquired the emperor's skin
held a parade and begged the world to look inside
I wanted fame, 'cause I thought fame could prove to me that I was great
it never came; I was a failure to myself

It's the way of the world to swallow you alive
The way of the world to swallow you alive
spirit first

It's been so long singing songs I couldn't possibly still mean
i guess they're lies if they've lost the truth they had
and it's so hard to get well, writing postcards home from Hell
I'd rather pack; I'd rather leave this all

It's the way of the world to swallow you alive
the way of the world to swallow you alive
spirit first

Whoa, Whoa
I give up
Whoa, Whoa
I give up

You get one life  and I spend mine chasing highways made of ghosts
now I don't know the way home from where I stand
And I believed I was free till I forgot what I believed
now I don't even need chains to hold me down

I'm always sick I know they'll never find a cure
The stomach bile's just the promise of a future cancer
Ill choke the acid back and just get by
And I'll avoid thinking about how soon I'm gonna die

But if they had a remedy if they somehow find a way
To end this anxious nausea or just keep it at bay
When they'd peer in my insides I know just what they'll say
It's Neon Gray

I'll die alone I know that there's no fucking doubt
I know I'll never find someone who gets what I'm about
I've tried but it's the same all in the end
They want to take so much I know I can never let them in

And if I can find someone who can take my nervous hand
Calm my bastard temper and maybe somehow understand
When she'd look into my eyes, she'd see in my dull gaze
It's Neon Gray

Neon Gray, Neon Gray – you're a broken human being
You're a thing you shouldn't say
The medication wears off by the darkening of the day
Every day that you breathe air it's Neon Gray

I've thought about ending it all so many times
Spinning awake each night I plan it all out in my mind
I've fantasized about how the hell and when
But I can never do it no matter how much I intend

The same thing that drives me to utter misery
It won't let me end my life, no, not so easily
The fear of the unknown will drag me to my end of days
It's Neon Gray

The slime runs down the coast and covers everything in sight
The teaming hordes from invading lands choke the beach out with their deadly blight
They take root everywhere and won’t clear out until September
We need an inconvenient truth to make some genocidal weather

As the icecaps melt
Into the sea
It’s the end for you
More room for me

Killer waves and monster surf
Wipe out everybody on this Earth
Finally the beach is mine
Looks like it’s finally time for
Killer Waves

As Mother Nature plots her revenge I’ll be waiting on higher ground
Until a tsunami wipes out all the invader in my boardwalk town
So when the big one comes I’m afraid you won’t be missed
It’ll be just me and the sea and you’ll no longer exist

As the icecaps melt
Into the sea
It’s the end for you
More room for me

Killer waves and monster surf
Wipe out everybody on this Earth
Finally the beach is mine
Looks like it’s finally time for
Killer Waves

Killer waves will clean the slate
Killer waves – your only fate

I live on a small street
Where we all know one another
And I live up in the attic
Of my father and my mother's
Everyone here keeps a close eye on me
Make sure I eat right and I sleep right
And before bed I brush my teeth

Born to die in suburbia
I'm born to die in suburbia
I'm born to die
And you know what I don't mind
I'm born to die in suburbia

Lately I don't get out too much
I'm happier inside
Sometimes I don't leave my room for weeks at a time
Sometimes I sin
But I'll never get caught
If the skeletons in my closet could talk
You know I'd be locked up cuz I'm

Born to die in suburbia
I'm born to die in suburbia
I'm born to die
And you know what I don't mind
I'm born to die in suburbia

I'm born to die in suburbia
I'm born to die in suburbia
I'm born to die
Never get out alive
I'm born to die in suburbia

Would have stole more than your name
Would have cursed and bought
The world off of your shoulders
You were in the wrong place

Are they just pinholes in the curtain of night?

Just water in my eyes?

And it ain't just a dream
Shivers down my spine
Caused by the liars in line

It's time for me to show you who I really am
Let me be the slaughter and you'll be the lamb

Chorus:

I see no reason for you to believe in
Your Last Denial
Your words are treason for me to receive and
Your Last Denial

A reflection of another domain?
I can see your through
Like the water in my eyes

The truth remain
The inner rain won't leave me behind
Traded thoughts result in pain
And those tears made me blind

And it's time for me to show you who I really am
Let me be the slaughter and you'll be the lamb

And the world came tumbling down on me
And the world will always be the same
I wanna be where the masters fail
When the world came tumbling down
It came tumbling down on me

There's no one I will fear
There is no warning here
There's no one I will fear

I wanna know right now!

Could you hold the chainsaw closer to your head?

I just should not give up

Burn my shadow on the flor
Burn my shadow forever
Burn my shadow forever
Who cares at all? Who cares at all?

I was proud, and I was standing
I was lost in a crowd
But now this room is abandoned
Everybody keep on fading out

I was strong like a lion
I was firm and devout
But now my history is dying
Everybody keep on fading out

Where do you go?
Where do you go when everything you know is pushing you away
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Out of this empty space in a vacant place I'll stay

I was sure that I'd found it
I was up on a cloud
While the others were grounded
Everybody keep on fading out

Where do you go?
Where do you go when everything you know is pushing you away
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Out of this empty space in a vacant place I'll stay

Gone out the window
Everybody keep on fading out

We lay in the glow of the neon city lights
Eyes on the wall through another sleepless night
I just wanna be, alone again

And I'm remembering
I was a wreck when we met at the dollar store
I should have just made a run for the exit door
I was into you, but now I'm in too deep

I was over my head but you said that I'm safer in your arms
I was over my head so I fled to the comfort of your charms

I guess at the time, you were so idealized
Now in the light of the day I realize
I was into you, but now I'm in too deep

And now I think that it is
Sad that I had to get tangled in the wires of your snare
It's sad that we had to evaporate and vanish in the air

I don't care if you go
I don't care if you go
I don't care if you up and walk away and just leave me with a wave in the dark
I don't care if you go
I don't care if you go
And now I see that it never really mattered, it's just another chapter to close
I don't care if you go

Do what you want, I am tired, I am sick of this
I never wanted to even admit to this
I was into you, now I'm in too deep

And now I'm telling you
I may be awake but I never really opened up my eyes
I may be awake but I never really wanted to rise

(Chorus)

Saturday
I watched you fly away
Across the empty sky
I turned around and waved goodbye

And now it's me alone
It's just an empty home
That's on an empty street
In a town that always sleeps

And a blind man in the darkness knows no difference
But I have grown accustomed to the colors that you bring

I check the dial tone
On the telephone
But when I try to speak
The reception gets so weak

I took an hour's drive
Into the countryside
The sky was bright and clear
But it was cold without you here

And my mind is turning back before I knew you
And the numbness was the only thing I'd ever really known
And I was home

Long ago, I was happy by myself
Long ago, it was me and no one else
Long ago, and then I saw your face

I got a photograph
Beneath a sheet of glass
Inside a cherry frame
But it is never quite the same

It's just a memory
A spot in history
But that's no good to me
When I am living here and now

Oh, I've tried to make my peace with all the silence
I have tried to patch the cracks, I've got my finger in the dam

And I've tried to find contentment in seclusion
But I will never really smile till the day that you return
Till you return

I went down to the parade
The streets were closed and everybody huddled to the barriers
Hoping for a better view, waiting for the floats to come through
And leave a trail of confetti in their wake

Oh, on a thousand roads
We are coming home

Yellow streamers on the ground
And blue balloons are floating overhead like restless satellites
Focused on the concrete, and straying down the side streets
At the mercy of the temperamental breeze

Oh, on a thousand roads
We are coming home
Old familiar roads
We are coming home

Every face was to the sky
A small town on a summer day to waste away with no better plan
Than to sit and watch a stray balloon, if only for an afternoon
And then continue on their way, another day

Oh, on a thousand roads
We are coming home
Old familiar roads
We are coming home

"
94206,"

Hey, what are we waiting for?
We've come to far to let this go
Always on the outside looking in

The door is swinging in the wind
It's time to go and march on in
It's time to show them what we're all about

I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now
I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now

I am gonna see again
And I am gonna feel again
We're not going to take this any more
We won't take this anymore

The shapes are hiding in the dark
The knives are out, the blades are sharp
It's one wrong move and all the lights are out

Watch your step and look ahead
Remember what the old man said
Failure is the aftermath of doubt

I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now
I can feel the change is coming in the air
I can feel the revolution now

"
94207,
94208,"

I've been sleeping with the lights on, buried in regrets
Breaking into sweats, naked as a falling leaf

It's a natural reaction, driven to distraction
Clawing at the ghosts I'll never meet

Oh, I don't know, where they go
When they vanish in the corner of my eye
And I, don't know why, I don't know
If they stay below or rise up to the sky

But I'm letting go
I'm letting go
It's a history that never really grows
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
It's a silent wind that never really blows
I'm letting go

I'm a slave without a master, heading for disaster
Kicking up the dust in the middle of the road

I've been waiting on a free ride ticket
To a seaside thicket on the edge of Puget Sound

And there I'll sit, and I'll admit
That I was only just a guest inside my skin
And by the dawn, I'll be gone
And I won't be holding on to anything again

(Chorus)

"
94209,"

I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
The hazy sunrise wraps a veil around my head
I can't get motivated, the swimming thoughts are drowning in my head
And if by some coincidence I do just what they said

And the morning blue is warning you
This avalanche is storming through
In the dawn of the morning blue
Just take me away

The fire of failed reason, the rain of every season
The patriotic treason, the ringing of the bells
The avalanche of sorrow, the soul afraid to borrow
There is no day tomorrow, keep living for today and let me

(chorus)
Just set me free and I will be
Afraid enough to find it
Take my hand or take a stand
And I would never mind it
Sit and stare or say a prayer
For all you left behind
Call on me, just never be
The last one in the line

I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
I should have stayed in bed and slept all day instead
There ain't no profit in this day that lies ahead
These blurry images still echo in my head

(chorus)

"
94210,"

In a crumbling land
I was singing in the junkyard choir again
And I was waiting for my moment to come
I was beating on the timpani drum in the rain

Asleep inside a rusty van
Parked beside the taxi stand
Well it's nothing I would ever recommend to you

The freaks are on parade
On the uptown promenade
If you ever wanna see the bottom, then I'll show you

I was screaming again
I was screaming at a hot dog vendor again
I can't remember why I snapped
Probably just a little lapse of reason

Virtues come and virtues go
I dressed up in women's clothes
And strolled down 42nd Street today

And I walked up to a man
In an Acura sedan, and said that
If you ever wanna see the bottom, then I'll show you

It's a long way to the top
And it's way more fun to drop
If you ever wanna see the bottom
Do you really wanna see the bottom?
If you really wanna see the bottom
Then I'll show you

"
94211,"

Well, this country's in the pits, so I really I should admit
That I feel it's time to do something about it

Our democracy is splintered, sold out to the highest bidder
And I only see a single way around it

Let's stop being so attendant, and declare our independence
And create a nation where we're in control

We can find a little island, and we'll climb up to the highlands
And we'll paint a flag and hoist it from a pole

It's sounding pretty sweet, but it's a little incomplete
There'd be nothing there to eat but weeds and ants

We could bring along some friends, and they could do the odds and ends
And start a farm so we could live off of the land

They'd need a place to stay, so we could find a way to pay
To hire an architect and builders to construct it

I suppose they'd need to buy some rudimentary supplies
They could use my credit card, and just deduct it

In the matter of a minute, my card would hit its limit
So we'd need to find some funding from our friends

We'll need to form an axis, if the mother land attacks us
And we'd better start an army to defend

We'd be careful on the spending, we'd have banks to do the lending
And we'd stay away from selfishness and greed

But I think our little nation's gonna need some light taxation
If we want to pay for everything we need

Like schools and banks and shopping malls
Fighter jets and border walls
City bus and subway stops
Doctors, cops and doughnut shops

Water, gas and sewer lines
Superhighways, traffic signs
Museums, parks, aquariums
Zoos and planetariums

I might need to think this through, cuz there's a lot of things to do
Just to get this little nation on the map

And I'm not sure that I would make it, yeah, this emperor is naked
And I'm tired and I'm ready for a nap

Maybe I should stay at home
And fix the problems on this road
And spread out to the neighborhoods
And make a change and do some good

We have got so many years
To make our mark and disappear
And enjoy the parks, aquariums
Zoos and planetariums

"
94212,"

History repeats itself
In the patterns in the stone
We close our eyes, and fumbling
We listen, or we don't

The anchorman is babbling
The weatherman's a liar
The sports report's a waste of time
For the bored and the tired

And the past is all we talk about
Cuz it's all we've ever known

I won't go back to the simple life
In the comfort of the womb
I'm finding a new road home

If I'm late for my own funeral
Don't let me hold you up
Just tell them I've got other plans
I've got work to do

I won't go back to the simple life
The past is gone
I won't go back to the simple life
I'm moving on

[Verse 1]
My heart, my soul, I'm begging you for more
I’m on my knees, baby please, can I drink from your loving cup?
I’m too scared to say that I love you
But I know I gotta see you tonight
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
Oh koko o sa wa te, oh come on pretty lady
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
Do you got a little love in your heart heart heart heart

[Chorus 1]
Go, tell me what I want to hear, tell me that I'm beautiful
Tell me that all again, 'cuz I remember grey skies too

[Verse 2]
I know it’s only rock n roll
But everything you do and where you are I’ll go
Oh did you see me waiting there out on the corner did I push it just a little too far ?
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
Oh koko o sa wa te, oh can I get a maybe
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
I’m gonna take you out for dinner and breakfast come on now!

[Chorus 1]
Go, tell me what I want to hear, tell me that I'm beautiful
Tell me that all again, 'cuz I remember grey skies too

[Chorus 2]
Tell me what I want to hear, and i’ll tell you that you’re beautiful
Tell me that all again, do you remember laughter too?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Take me to the bridge we’ll leave without a sound
Take me to your house when no one is around
We’ll meet outside of Ginza girl if you got it in ya
I can’t wait til the sun goes down down

[Chorus 1]
Go, tell me what I want to hear, tell me that I’m beautiful
Turn it all on again, 'cuz I remember grey skies too

[Chorus 2]
Go, tell me what I want to hear, and I’ll tell you that you’re beautiful
Tell me that all again, do you remember laughter too?

[Outro]
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear

Well hey there high school stranger
So very nice to meet you
She was a cruel cruel Countess
Who killed her every mistress
To keep her young and fresh faced
She bathed in blood
Bathed in blood

No matter what they said
She'd cut them off and left them there for dead
And every scene she leaves
Looks like something from the land of make believe

Sweet Elizabeth
Sweet Elizabeth

She had a great big wedding
Just as the sun was setting
There was an endless guest list
Anything for the Countess

And when she disappeared, she
She stole their hearts
Stole their hearts

All of this and more
She'd lure them in and then she'd close the door
None of them would leave
A goodbye kiss would be the last they'd breathe

Sweet Elizabeth
Sweet Elizabeth

They locked her in a room
Sealed up with bricks to guarantee her doom
But still she would live on
To capture hearts into oblivion

Sweet Elizabeth
Sweet Elizabeth

Now can't you hear me call?

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
I'm sure that's all you need
To make it all right

It's taken me so long
To get where I belong
Oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah
For I will make you pay

Then I will go away
And I won't come back this again. No

That you've been untrue
You've gone and broke my heart
And made me blue
Turned my head around
Then you tore me down

I'd not be sad
'Cause when I hear your voice
It makes me glad
Baby's not around
Heard she's leaving town

Baby, baby
Don't run away
I want you to stay
I'm sorry
So sorry
I made you blue
And now you should be sorry too
Should be sorry too

Now I'm so alone
You're far away
I sit here at home
No words to say
To anyone around
'Cause you tore me down
You tore me down
Tore me down
Tore me down

Better leave away that thought that I had before

Know it from my king .. ignore

My Boat, sweet anger, sweet salvage, Cast anchor upon my fingers

On thougts, the coasts of past hopes, eroded with tears, teardrops

Me and My Boat

You've got no sails, you won't give in to the winds. As far as eyes can tell. You indulge my every whim. Each stroke soaked in passion

Give me a mirror and I'll show you my enemy
The fear that tears through my pores ripping inside of me
A homemade bomb grows in my palm as I cut me free
My arms are witness to my ruthless loss of dignity
And all the pretty girls call me a freak
I just cut myself trying to stay neat
I'm a toothache-giving b*tch darling
I'm so sweet
I built a castle was no hassle my skin, building blocks
My cherry blood slowly floods and clots to make the knots
Up in my fortress I'm a righteous duchess super clean
The love I give myself above all else is quite serene
And all the pretty girls call me a freak
I just cut myself trying to stay neat
I'm a toothache-giving b*tch darling
I'm so sweet

Gave a gift to me:
Oblong box
Plastic made
Mostly tin
Cheap electronics
Plug it in
With blinking lights

Want remover

Those judges shows I used to like
Continue on but I don't mind
Actors playing both parts
Judge Mathis would never stand for it

My want remover

And I'm free free free free from want
And I'm free free from fear
Drain me out and I don't care
Machine is working for me

What I swallow and what I eat
I pay no mind

The Wayne County Stank Dogs
Will play in the open air there
The suburban fathers
Will be in the city center

The sports bar exploded and everyone died
Now you know how it feels to be alive
Scum, rise!

And who was the target?
An old man with a tattoo on his wrist
Scum, rise!

Take your seat there on the left side

And how were you to know?
The tattoo number 19
Stylized in memory of Steve Yzerman
Scum, rise!
Scum, rise!

You were only seven years old
When your father left you there
How were you to know
He never loved or cared?

Some day you'll want your revenge
See him languish in his gore
Until that day I'm sorry to say
There's nothing you can do

They will never ask you
What the wall said
To you in that room

Listening through plaster
The sodium light's a hissing wound
Nights spent alone in company

The glass screwed into your fist
Beware of pity
When it comes back it sounds like this

Remember waking up between borders
Out of your mind
A remix of a rare old tune

You always knew this night would come
Have you laughing out of every hole

And what will you miss
Alice in Chains played on repeat
Not feeling great 'til you're twenty percent

Misunderstood
Friends without names
Blood forms a face
Drawing a blank

Stumbling around
For a hand in the dark
Slapping you down
Choking you out

They will never ask you
What the wall said
To you in that room

Mero
Met Livy in the line
To drown the frog mouths
In the bar I already told you about
They talked of philosophical things
Like transcendence
And the opposite
Of suffering

Mero
Said he could walk
The city only
On hot fry bags, cognac bottles, and used rubbers
Livy recalled when the Giants came
I didn't care about anything
Except warm hands in the cold air
Now I am suffering
The exact opposite
And from the balcony
The sound of Greg Baise laughing

Have you heard the bad news?
We've been saved by both coasts
A bag of snakes with heads of gas
The complicated haircuts ride in on a white ass

And I'll try to live defeated
Come and see the good in everything
Outside, animals sound
Come and see the open ending

Let it snow, and freeze them in their minds
Count their money with broken arms
Come as friends, are you ready to be capitalized?
In this town
In this hole

And I'll try to live defeated
Come and see the good in everything
Outside, animals sound
Come and see them lead us onto heaven

I'm gonna tell you a story
About how it was
When I'm asleep
And I do dream

I see him there
Sitting in that chair
And when I'm awake
And I'm walking through the day

I see him, see him there
Sitting in that chair
In a house of books
Blowing smoke from a pipe

But the picture blurs
And that clock is rewound

The clock needs to be wound
It still needs to be wound
The clock needs to be wound
It still needs to be wound

Rested well on the train last night
But had to drape my coat on
It's so cold here, and just like up north, it's raining cats and dogs
A final april evening breathes in through the door, to find you there

This city has known us
This city has
This city has grown

You held us all in your arms, for some time
And how i wished to belong, to you
Collected all here, in boxes and bags, directions where to go
A final april evening breathes in through the door, to find you there

This city has known us
This city has

It's the end of the line
For the wrong or right reasons
You can lie to yourself

With all the boyish progressions
Flying wakeless and weightless
Can never fall to the floor

Or so you're finding out
You've no ups and no downs
Or so you're finding out
You've no ups and no downs

The maths and the code
That keep you in sequence
To fight or to flee

At the tip of your toes
With your boots off the stairs
You begin to derive them

Or so you're finding out
You've no ups and no downs
Or so you're finding out
You've no ups and no downs

We see you outside the door
But we won't let you in

Great canals, siphon the seas
Before we choke on the rust in defeat
Fuck what could have been

The parasite that bleeds from my brain
The iron oxide back home on the range
No i'm not losing it, love... but

I have let you down
I will let you down
All the way down

Its nothing that i wanted you to see
But you had all of these tricks up your sleeve
No, i'm not paranoid, love

Oh, how i wanted to be
A dark valley that could wind its way free
Now it's become perilous... and

I have let you down
I will let you down
All the way down

I wanted to walk through the weeds
Without needing the bubble to breathe
Just once before the final note

I have let you down
I will let you down
All the way down

Careful where you hide
Careful where you hide
Because i'm on your side
Because i'm on your side

It's always this way
You gave up some(where) along the way
Laid out on the tile, for some time
You swallow whole to let dissolve

The monster
Will pick and devour your life

The monster
The monster in your eyes

The monster
Will pick and devour your life

The monster
The monster in your eyes

We all hide
And this is my hour, tonight

We all hide
And this is my hour, tonight

We all hide
And this is my hour, tonight

We all hide
The monsters in our eyes

I will rest
On jupiter tonight

I will start
On jupiter tonight

Verns is doing nicely
Will move him sunday
If i can get someone to take care of him at home
We have to watch him closely
To keep him from sitting up straight, or standing
We were so pleased with his form

My hat will be black

"
96796,"

Think your turn
Came and went
Take a number
Pay the rent

Snap a picture
Fold the page
Barely breathing
We operate

Give it up
Take your dose
Make it fast
Im gonna choke

Take a moment
To percolate
Shut your mouth
And operate

So if you call
And no-one's home
I will trust you
To leave me alone

And if you hold out
And if you hold out
And if you hold out
Its getting old...
The same old...

You operate
How appropriate
It's open ended
A fight to the death

You operate
How appropriate
You'll get your fever
A fight to the death

An opiate
To operate
You won't share
You won't stop

You operate
How appropriate
You'll get your fever
A fight to the death

They march in time
Ooh i feel their eyes

"
96797,"

So this begins my last will and confession:
Pack my bags, drown my car under that torrent cloud
A vapor trail as subtle as the past that pried me open
And here where you aren't, the atmosphere is right

Just don't breathe in twice
Don't breathe in twice

I'm sure by now, the people here, would have learned to love me
By different names, pleasantries, my comet halley
Adjust the lens and light, to see what they see
'cause we all become what they want us to be, don't we
Don't we?

We are for you

[Chorus: Danny Wilder]
Mother there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions some wrong some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

[Hook: Danny Wilder]
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

[Drop: Danny Wilder & Ali Bla Bla]
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

I smoke the chung while my heart bleeds burgundy
Stuck on the title page, still yearning to turn the sheet
(Come on)

This book of lies got me shook of life
Still picturing crooked ties
I must of mistook for right
Getting licked again and again
Whether the venom is peng
It severs several levels in head
But for some reason, I'm several levels ahead of these
Sheep and cattle, wannabes wannabe street and battle
But many die in war, that's a fact
In the pursuit of glory, men will attack intact no looking back
Bang!

[Bridge: Danny Wilder]
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too

[Break: Sample]
Stand the fuck up

[Drop: Danny Wilder & Koken]
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

Bumped into the devil up at the crossroads
Searching for lost souls
Picking them up in bulk like Costco's
And whoever's written my life movie
Done gave me some plot holes
But made me sharp enough so I clocked those
The times it was too late
The penny just dropped slow
Cause people are scared when they shoot the sheriff
But not when they shot Os
And that's how far you go
To cop those designer jeans
And It's a no-brainer

[Chorus: Danny Wilder]
Mother there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions some wrong some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

This skin hangs on me like a lampshade
Keeping all my light at bay
That night I banged at winter's doorstep
For just a look at your face
Let me in, I said, I know someone inside
I just haven't met them yet
November, please don't make me beg

Your big sad eyes
Your crooked smile
Your capped teeth
Your widow's peak

Oh, my November baby

Now everywhere I go, I see you
When I walk and when I sleep
I hear you on the tongues of strangers
I hang on every word they speak
I try to be just where you are
But summer takes you far from me
So just for now I place an angel
Atop an early Christmas tree

Your big sad eyes
Your crooked smile
Your capped teeth
Your widow's peak

Oh, my November baby
Oh, my November baby

Your big sad eyes
Your crooked smile
Your capped teeth
Your widow's peak

Oh, my November baby
Oh, my November baby

These lives are so contrived
And out of focus
But if I can derive some happiness from this
Then I’ll have made it out alive

‘Cause people always change
But ain’t always changing for the better
And just because the two of us
Will both grow old in time
Don’t mean we should grow old together
So I’ll be sure to turn my back
On everything you said you’d do
I’m gonna come to terms
Before I have to

Been keeping all my time In my back pocket
Taking from it only what I need to be
Whoever I’m supposed to be
But when I look at you I get so lonely
I used to just adore you
But now you bore me

‘Cause people always change
But ain’t always changing for the better
And just because the two of us
Will both grow old in time
Don’t mean we should grow old together
So I’ll be sure to turn my back
On everything you said you’d do
I’m gonna come to terms
Before I have to

I’ll never know If looking out the window
Is what brings me to my knees
Or if it’s what’s inside that’s killing me

‘Cause people always change
But ain’t always changing for the better
And just because the two of us
Will both grow old in time
Don’t mean we should grow old together
So I’ll be sure to turn my back
On everything you said you’d do
I’m gonna come to terms
I’m gonna come to terms
Before I have to

There are cracks in the wall
Giving me only slivers of the sun
I remember it all
Truths being told as soon as our minds were gone

Don’t tell me there’s no way your mind will change
Even the leaves grow weary of the trees from which they came
You can’t hang onto something if it’s gone and lost its color
So go find someplace warm I’ll still be here when Winter’s over

You always made my head spin
More than the whiskey on our lips
I just needed thicker skin
To help me loosen up my grip

Don’t tell me there’s no way your mind will change
Even the leaves grow weary of the trees from which they came
You can’t hang onto something if it’s gone and lost its color
So go find someplace warm I’ll still be here when winter’s over

Go find someplace warm I’ll still be here when Winter’s over

What am I supposed to say, babe?
I’ll be up all night to tell the truth
Would you really have a stranger in your bed
Rather than let someone like me take care of you?
It’s no one’s problem but my own
I think I’ve always cared too much
I’m suffocating you I know
It’s just the only way I know to love, know to love

[Chorus]
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
‘Cause Jealousy and I
We’re two of a kind
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine

You don’t owe me anything
But you’ve got to spell it out for me
‘Cause if you’re saying things that you don’t mean
Then you don’t really want me at your feet
At your feet

[Chorus]
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
‘Cause Jealousy and I
We’re two of a kind
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine

I’ll never let her go
I’ll never let her go
Never let her go
I’ll never let her go

[Chorus]
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind

And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine

This cannot happen again
Twice in a year is too much
Heavy are you on my mind
Twice in a flush, it ain’t enough

Honey, while you were ashing in your coffee
I was thinking ‘bout telling you
What you’ve done to me
Honey, pretending like it never happened
Come over here and let me
Put you back together

Writing just to save my life
You stretch barelegged across each line
What ghost crawled inside my guitar?
Don’t move, just stay right where you are
I don’t need to look I’d know that voice anywhere
Everything hurts but it’s fine (it’s fine)
Happens all the time
Oh, happens all the time
Heavy are you on my mind
Heavy are you on my mind

Honey, while you were ashing in your coffee

Is it lust that keeps me begging on my knees?
Is it a masochist that makes a fool of me?
Am I wanting you or haunting me oh please

Hold on tight, love me love me love me love me more
And the way you move it makes me know I'm so sure
And the way you talk it makes me know I adore
Hold on tight, make me make me make me make me sure

Tied to what I want and what I think is fate
One thing, I can be sure

Why can life be so unfair
Why I dance down here, not there
In a bar I feel so cold
Give me some heat, I want to grow
I was dancin’ in theatres in the past
Green and gold, danced off my ass
Red velvet seats fit for a queen
But now I shimmy on a bar like a tore up thing
Why can life be so unfair
Why I dance down here, not there

Better than diamonds you’ll find

And with the power sayin what you want
And with the power sayin what you need
And when the power calls me on the phone
I will comfort myself I’m not alone
You will release yourself from hypnoties and their lies
Still time to discover all the worlds we’ve lost
No way to recover all that we were taught
Nowhere to stand like a fool
Get on your white horse, don’t just go to school
Cos the times are changing now
No matter what you do
They try to tell you what to do or say
They try to put their fear up in your way
Or else they say you’re bein’ saved

VERSE 1
One blessed instant, thought I'd laid my battles down
But once again it's time to move along
Though my body's aching
I spent my time, my precious time
When time was all I waited for
Scaling every dizzy height
To see what lay ahead
And they say that strength lies in the heart
I say it's in my wayward attitude
The gypsy's mark engraved upon my brow

VERSE 2
With all my secret wishes thrown upon the wind
Some come true and others never will
And some I can't remember
I lost my love, my precious love
When love was all I counted on
I got too busy hunting down what I held in my hand
And they say that strength lies in the bone
I say it's in my stony attitude
I walk away and won't be turned around

CHORUS
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn

VERSE
One battle lost and yet another battle's won
Now's the time to hitch up and be strong
Though my heart is breaking
We move into those vacancies
And never really come to see
Our craving runs much deeper than we are prepared to go
And tonight I need a star to guide me home
I see the moon is on the run
I travel light and won't be far behind

CHORUS
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn

Thought once I had a King;
Wore an invisible crown
Sometimes spoke truth
Mostly knew to say the wrong thing at the right time
Faithfully I played the clown
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men
Could not put my heart
Back together again
Fall, fall away
Time heals, or so they bravely say
Well all this time I feel
Silence holds you real
Still I play the courtier
Your courtier in the wings
Chasing shadows
Clutching precious things
All your pretty horses
And all these men
No they won’t
Oh they can’t put my heart together again
Counting crows in the sky
Wondering if I
Could fall from great heights
If your wisdom was my pride
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men
No they won’t
Oh they can't put my heart together again
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men
Could not put my heart
Back together again
No they won’t, they can’t put my heart together again

Every morning - endless falling
You say my name, but each time is not the same

The pillow talk is getting boring
I wouldn't play your game
So forget it, go away

Twisted Head is full of nothing
What can you say?
We got the overdose again [all over]

Shut 'em up, it's time for lovers
You can't deny, our time is over
But I feel young until the end

Twisted Head is full of nothing
What can you say?
We got the overdose again [all over]

Now we fall asleep for thousand hours
Everything's dead
We got the overdose again [all over]

I wish I were a performer
And you were my fan
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

If you thought I was smart
If you thought I was neat
It would melt my heart
And make it skip a beat

If I had famous parents, would you pay attention
To every word I say?
I'd know you were lyin', it would leave me cryin'
I hope you know that's not the way to do things

I know it's hard to love a person who can't really see
But don't get discouraged, it doesn't have to be
I wish I had superpowers, how nice that would be
I'd make other girls invisible, so you'd have to look at me

I'd be drop-dead gorgeous (I'd be drop-dead gorgeous)
That you couldn't stand (That you couldn't stand)
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

If I had lots of money, would you think I'm funny
And laugh at every joke I tell?
I don't think I'd like it when you go ""ha ha ha""
You're going straight to H-E-L-L-O, goodbye

I wish I were a performer
And you were my fan
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

'Cause I know you don't love me
But I think you can
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)
If I could be your hero (If I could be your hero)
You could be my man (You could be my man)

She gets on her banana bike and pedals all around
She gets on her banana bike and travels through the town
There's just no stopping her, this is for sure
She gets on her banana bike and pedals more and more

She meets up with her friends and goes and goes and goes
Where's her destination? Sometimes no one knows
She disappears for days on end
Is she by herself or is she with a friend?

Banana bike, banana bike
Banana bike, banana bike

She keeps us guessing, always on her toes
When is she gonna get on that banana bike?

Banana bike, banana bike

She doesn't need to worry about the price of gas

Faster and faster, I go by the minute
Hotter and hotter, I almost did it
Stoplight won't stop me, it won't inhibit
I'm not going the speed limit

Can't stay too long, I have to dash
Heading for trouble, heading for a crash
Watch out, watch out!
Whoo, I missed it by one eyelash

Head low and in a breeze
Race the racin' in my heart
Ready, get, go!

Hand on the bars, feet on the pedal
Goin' so fast I should get a medal
My blood is pumpin', boilin' like a kettle
But I'll never stop (No!) I'll never settle

So don't get too near (A limit)

C'est parce-que je suis un vrai rebelle
Hein qu'je suis un vrai rebelle?
Dans mes rêves, je mange des gants et j'trouve ça bon
Est-ce que je passe pour un bouffon?
(Est-ce que je passe pour un bouffon?)
Et pourquoi personne me répond?
(Et pourquoi personne me répond?)

[Couplet 2]
Toi
Tu rêves de mieux
Tu rêves un peu
Tu rêves qu'tu dors dans ton pieu
Toi
Tu rêves plus beau
Tu rêves d'un frigo
Tu rêves que t'a un beau chapeau?
Toi
Tu rêves de quoi?
Tu rêves de toi!
Tu rêves que tu manges du bouda
Toi
Tu rêves normal
Tu rêves que dalle
Tu rêves que t'as une queue de cheval

[Refrain]
Dans mes rêves, je vend ta soeur pour un sandwhich
OUAIS!
Dans mes rêves, je plante du riz pour mes amis
Dans mes rêves, je creuse des trous dans du jambon
Dans mes rêves, je perd au dames contre une olive

[Pont]
Parfois j'rigole
Parfois je miaule
Parfois je mue
Parfois je sue
Parfois je vole
Parfois je viole
Parfois je mue
Parfois je tue

(Verse 1 - Hi-Rez)
Now I grew up on the motherfucking east coast
Cause of my rhyme scheme all these groupies wanna deep throat
Looking out the peephole, paranoid blunt to the dome
Death is knocking at the door like I invited him home
Anybody talking shit can take a bite of the chrome
My own motherfucking mind got a mind of its own
I'm rolling the zone, I've been into killing myself
Nobody willing to help, I wish this feeling would melt
I ain't talking masturbation, but I'm feeling myself
Lyrically pillaging villages, burn 'em down to the ground
Don't make a sound, put the money in the bag, turn around
My thoughts they running wild, kill a hater with a smile
Any hard working job take practice, groupies in the mattress
Do it for the ratchets, hit the L and puff, puff, pass it
Ash it, enemies in caskets, make 'em disappear like magic
Poof

(Hook - Hi-Rez)
Any critic talking shit, they can eat a full clip
I'mma make 'em disappear like poof (like poof)
If you wanna take a risk, you gonna have to meet my clique
They gon' make you disappear like poof (motherfucker)
If you bringing out your chick, she gon' end up on my dick
I'mma make her disappear like poof
If you wanna take a risk, you gonna have to meet my clique
Let them make you disappear like poof

(Verse 2 - Hi-Rez)
Fuck a hater, fuck a critic, get your paper, keep it pimping
I'm flipping zips of the chronic and rolling some up like sonic
I'm vomiting on a comet, a kamikaze with problems
Emotions, keeping them bottled, these dutches is getting hollowed
Cause tomorrow never promised, those never honest
I'm toxic, atomic mixed with Osama bin Laden
I'm bringing drama, these choppers killing these coppers
I'm higher than Dr. Spock, I'm Notorious mixed with Pac
I'm putting on for my city, I putting on for my block
Pull a trigger, kill a fuck boy
Hiding out who I be smoking in the cut, boy
Haters talking shit, then they Aflac, duck, boy
Shit, but I don't really give a fuck, boy

(Hook)

"
98567,"

Yeah yo...Uh uh
Test test word
Gynus...Hi-Rez you already know

[Verse 1]

Hey my mind 'bout to explode
Somebody roll somethin' up and get stoned
Throw me a bone, I need a clone just to make everyone happy I know
Never gon' fold I'm taking the pot
Speaking of pot I've been smoking a lot
You better watch out uh haha
Stay in your lane or take a different route
Smoking on sour just to forget all the stress I've been having
I'm lapping these rappers who wack
Ya'll just some faggots rapping 'bout money and stacks
Bitches and bottles and crack
Me - I spit crack, bag it and sell it with tax
Smoking that bomb like Iraq
Abundance of weed it's taller than Shaq, it's taller than Shaq
Feeling so antsy, feelin' like I can't breathe
Like I'm laying on the floor under a stampede
All these critics can get fucked no Plan B
I'm separated from the haters like Pangaea
Got a little hope got a little bit of dope
If it doesn't work out I'll be hanging from a rope
I ain't rapping for the dough, I ain't rapping for the money
I ain't rapping for the hoes, I ain't rapping for the hunnies
I'm doing this to live and just escape when I'm pissed always patient
Now I'm sick of fuckin' waitin' for this shit
I'm blazing a bunch of piff I'm chasing what don't exist
I'm praying for better days cause I've been feeling the prison of my own mind
Feeling like these long time nuts you can hold mine
I've been spitting coke lines take it to your sinus
Killin' haters with kindness only smoking the finest
Every day I'm grindin', every day I'm grindin' bitch

[Hook]

For the motherfuckin' world ho, for my girl ho
I ain't deserving
I'm out here motherfuckin' solo with my eyes so low
I'm far from a perfect person
Every motherfuckin' day I wake up pissed off
Feeling like I'm worthless
All these other rappers out here poppin' Crystal
Fuck that God gave me a purpose

Once upon a time there was a guy who died
And he lived happily ever after
Once upon a time there was a guy who died
And he lived happily ever after x2

[Verse 2]

Mentally lost but at what cost
What's all this for? still I want more
Every day wakin' up pissed and ignored
The Reaper is knocking don't answer the door
Never been poor, never been rich
Emotions and feelings are always so mixed
Go hide your bitch, single as shit
Fuck every single relationship
Skip all the kissing and give me some brains
On top of that I've been going insane
Shackled and chained stay in your lane
Bitch I'm just so sick of playing your games
Speaking of game the game needed change
Not just somebody who looking for fame
Not saying names I go through pain
We ain't the same muhfucka you know
Sick and tired of feeling how I been feeling
Been killing myself in sacrifice when I know I'm the realest
Depression mean I'm the illest I'm a hero with a villainous spirit
I fear no evil, in my raps you can hear it
Explain what's in the way
I'm blazing a bunch of haze, I'm praying for better days
No longer am I afraid of being different
Surrounding myself with people with ambitions
Get the fuck up out my business shut the fuck up I'm mad now listen to me
Please from the 'burbs to the streets I'm a person of peace who'll serve any fiend
Who talkin' that good good rollin' a backwood jumping through my old hood
Wish a motherfucker would but they all talk

Love, you make me lose my marbles
We were on the up and up
The front door painted red
We collected marbles in a jar under the bed
We played our forty-fives
My mom warmed up to you
We were young and shooting marbles
Well, soon enough the times go tough, and we weren't making sand
Each and every shiny pearl kept rolling out of hand
So the times were getting tough, but we were getting tougher
And if I have you, then who needs marbles?

You move me
Oh, you move me

I swear I'll bring home thirty more and be your better man
I'll clean up good and sell the show and hold onto my band
Well, I bought you the new suit, and I figured wool would last
You dirtied it while shooting marbles
I bought us a piano so our kids would grow up smart
And dig up all the songs we wrote back when we had the heart
Oh, the ivory will chip
The strings will surely rust
Your kids will know the difference from the lyrics in the dust

You'll love me in ways nothing else me
You'll love me

Stay even when the last one goes
Will you stay around for when the marbles roll?
Stay, stay, stay, will you stay even when the last one goes?
Cause that's real love
Picking up your marbles rolled
I will stay, stay, stay
Lover I believe you, but you've got the upper hand
You push and pull and break my heart just because you can
Real love, even when the marbles roll

You'll love me

"
98604,"

I live in these white walls alone
No regard for where I'm going or where I'm coming from
I smoke my weed and watch TV
Doing all this thinking's made me weary on my feet

The night is young
I would rather sleep than remember the things I've lost
When I close my eyes
I can hear a ringing in my ears from words you said to me all night

Been talking to myself a lot
Seeing your reflection in the sunglasses I bought
And I swear, if I see your face
I will keep on living, pretend I don't know your name

I am a liar
I miss almost everything about you and your smile
When I close my eyes
I can hear a ringing in my ears from words you said to me all night

I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
I can hear the ringing still
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
You said you never loved me and I know you never will
You said you never loved me and I know you never will

"
98605,"

While I did the limit in your daughter's car
She confessed it all to me
You don't know the weight of all the words you say
I don't know why, but she holds each one close to heart

You're wasting your time
You won't change a thing
She's rolling her eyes
But you swear all the same
That girl will find her way

While I'm the one who watches empty bottles hit the ground
You're the one who brings her down
We were breaking habits until you stepped in
And one by one, one by one, you have fixed them all

You're wasting your time
You won't change a thing
She's rolling her eyes
But you swear all the same
That girl will find her way
That girl will find her way

Will find her way and see the reason why you say those things
And read between the lines
Well, I know in the instant when I see her smile
We'll find a brighter day
That girl will find her way
One, two, three, four

I was doing ninety in your daughter's car
She was faking fast asleep
You don't know the weight of all the words you say
But I've had time to think

"
98606,"

[Verse 1]
Humming to a sea snail
Humming to a sea snail with the highest hopes
You would find it hollow
Nothing came from singing but a tired throat
And I'll be anything you want me to be
I'll be anything you want me to be

[Verse 2]
I saw you at the sea shore
Rocks at your ankles, looking tough
You're dirtying your clean hands
Wishfully thinking it could be enough
And I'll be anything you want me to be
I'll be anything you want me to be

[Bridge]
I'll go my life ears cupped, eyes shut
Because I heard and saw things I wish I had not
I'll go my life ears cupped, eyes shut
Because I heard and saw things I wish I had not

[Verse 3]
As soon as I awaken
As soon as I awaken you'll be gone
And half of me is shaking
The other half has never been more sure
I'll be anything you want me to be
I'll be anything you want, everything you need
Anything you want me to be

"
98607,"

[Verse 1]
Oh, a foolish game we play
It's getting harder every day to keep a steel frame on my heart
Oh, it always ends the same
And no one this plain could ever scrape the sky
Come and break me

[Chorus]
Oh, my wrecking ball, I reckon I'll fall for you
I will fall for you
Oh, my wrecking ball, I reckon I'll fall for you
I will fall for you

[Verse 2]
Oh, what solidness you fake
Make the rafters shake and knock my spirit off its toes
Oh, I've never been this tame
And if things stay this way I'll break the same
Come and break me

[Chorus]
Oh, my wrecking ball, I reckon I'll fall for you
I will fall for you
Oh, my wrecking ball, I reckon I'll fall for you
I will fall for you

[Bridge]
Come and break me
It's in the rubble I begin
It's in the rubble I begin
It's in the rubble I begin to rebuild myself again
It's in the rubble I begin to rebuild myself

[Chorus]
Oh, my wrecking ball, I reckon I'll fall for you
I will fall for you
Oh, my wrecking ball, I reckon I'll fall for you
I will fall for you

"
98608,"

Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul

For you I fall hard
Singing in my basement
The words from song books convenient to explain this
Silvery sounds slipped from our sore throats
And we could go on singing our hearts out
Singing our hearts out

Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul
Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul

For you a full heart
And I would trade the memories to have it all again
Singing our hearts out
Singing our hearts out

Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul
Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul

When the pages burn
When the sun hits town and lights call
Will you sing wildly?
Will you make up a song on the spot for me?

Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul
Oh, to wait on you hand and foot, heart and soul

"
98609,"

You let all the air out of the things you used to say
No more grinding up your phrases for my bread
It used to be, I'd hang on all your ""na na na na na nas""
It's not like that anymore
And so we fall, but all in all, I think we're better off this way

Sing to me sweetly of the end
And leave me one last song
One last song
Suddenly say goodbye, my love
Let go and start again

I listened for the rain to stop while lying in your bed
And stared at imperfections on your walls
""I will not be, I cannot be, don't want to be yours no more""
You whisper tenderly in my ear
But I'm not angry
I'm not sad, just disappointed

Sing to me sweetly of the end
And leave me one last song
One last song
Suddenly say goodbye, my love
Let go and start again

To laugh or cry, I can't decide
I'll just forget it all instead

Sing to me sweetly of the end
And leave me one last song
One last song
Suddenly say goodbye, my love
Let go

"
98610,"

[Verse 1]
Walls, they are riddled with holes
And I can firmly say that holes or not these walls are my own
Alone, my thoughts are heavy on the pillow
And I can't help but wonder what could be beneath the floorboards

[Chorus]
Summer in a new state
Would you be my blank slate?
Be the boxes made of cardboard and move me

[Verse 2]
Don't know what's keeping me awake
I keep on focusing on every sound I hear from my home
Bells ring and neighbors sing
It's the kind of thing reminds me of the place I come from

[Chorus]
Summer in a new state
Would you be my blank slate?
Be the boxes made of cardboard and move me
Summer in a new state
You'll be my one and only
Be the needle to the record and move me

[Chorus]
Summer in a new state
Would you be my blank slate?
Be the boxes made of cardboard and move me
And move me
Summer in a new state
You'll be my one and only
Be the needle to the record and move me

"
98611,"

[Verse 1]
Your human heart did burn bright
You put up a good fight
They brought your broken bones from the field
And laid you on the kitchen floor
Gave you air and sent for more fuel to raise the fire in your shell
I won't let you go
I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I will fix your moving parts
I'll know exactly how you tick
Exactly how you turn
I will fix your moving parts
I'll know exactly how you work
Exactly how you run

[Verse 2]
Everyone is leaving
I am standing by your side
Then when you open your eyes
I'll be the name you call for when you learn to talk
The hand you'll reach for when you learn to walk
I won't let you go
I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I will fix your moving parts
I'll know exactly how you tick
Exactly how you turn
I will fix your moving parts
I'll know exactly how you work
Exactly how you run

[Bridge]
How you run
How you run
How you run
I will fix your moving parts
How you run
How you run
How you run
I will fix your moving parts
I break you just to build you back
Knowing that you need me
It keeps me going
I break you just to build you back
Knowing that you need me
It keeps me going

My keys in my pocket
My suitcase is packed
On a mission to nowhere and I'm not coming back
My hands, they are shaking
I'm sure that will stop
Rather take off running than stay here and rot
I gave it my all and I've got nothing left
The weight from this town pulls the air from my chest
I promise to write and send souvenirs
But I will be gone in the morning

Your keys on my nightstand and your suitcase the floor
The last thing I'll do is deadbolt the door
My hands sure are shaking
It may never stop
Not if I'm stuck in this town you forgot
Your friends will be standing
You gas up your car
Now they have pinned down the person you are
You're saying you're mine
You've already gone
But you will be here in the morning

I may not be the first to say I'm leaving
But sure enough I'm bound to hit the road
All my heirlooms are empty
You will have to watch me go
You should've seen the light go out in your eyes
When you finally caught on to the words I'm softly screaming
The right ones all along
You should've seen the light
You should've seen the light
Should've seen the light
Should've seen the light

Dear Father now im a man, 21 with about 21 plans
For plenty of grands, back in the day I dun many dumb scams
When I was a kid, you said I wasn't shit coz I went and hung around 21 mans, you wasn't a fan
Flopped in school coz I thought I was cool by adding a Q to 21 grams
But theres something you dont understand, you were raised in a different land
But I grew up in London Town where theres thugs and hounds and gunman round
With goons that hustle with tools as muscle and sirens are the abundant sound
I was mixing with drugs and clowns, heard the devil calling but it some how drowned
When I look back it was like a montage, with a backing track made by The Beatles
I was looking like a slave to the evil, coulda been dead or in jail in the sequel
With a desperado mentality, that invest in hard doe reality
But that life of snakes and ladders would carry this wise guy straight to insanity
Imagine me, sittin in my flat on my ones, smoke on tap for my lungs
I wouldn't even chat to my mum, trapped and alone, all for the lust of the funds
With no trust for your son, thinking where has he gone? and what has he done?
But I never meant to do wrong, so I gotta move on while I sing this song

With times gone by in his hands
Listen To The Old Man
If you can't find no advice where you stand
Listen To The Old Man

2 (Ali Bla Bla)
And they say...
Things aren't what they seem, you split from mum when I was fourteen
Left the country like you had moved team, never saw the times I wiped my tears clean
And as a teen, I hardly smiled, never wondering why your son had been wild
Excepting that you made a blunder with child, but you can't sweep lost years under the pile
And even though I still had a good home, with family affairs and no man ever there
I'd go on the roads and would roam, with the olders who talked in a hood tone, ha!
Those years just flew right past me, like lifes just one big party
You tell me to act calmly thinking, How can I listen when I can't see?
When I look back it was all the anger, with a feeling that wasn't mutual
Another bloodshot vein in the pupil, to people around me it took on a few tolls
And at what cost, Thinking im a big boss? as if Ali Bla Bla was Rick Ross!
Tried floss for the girls with the lip gloss, but the truth is, really I would live lost
But now times are changing, had to take your advice coz my life needs saving
When I look back, yes I was the worst behaving, and really there was only my self in blaming
But last year grand dad died and I saw that look of regret in your eye
From relationship ties, and it made start questioning mine


With times gone by in his hands
Listen To The Old Man
If you can't find no advice where you stand
Listen To The Old Man

3 (Danny Wilder)
If only we had known that long before we had grown
Into similar images, few psyical differences
From pictures we've been shown, of our own flesh and bone
At the same age we had been veering alone
Way off the tracks, attracted to the other side
I'd run and hide in stupidity, literally, fiction free, it was a reality
Gradually though, I had actually grown to realise
The debt I was in. I was in no place to waste what I'd been given
And maybe we've been raised to make a difference
Finally i see that it pays to make a living
Finally i agree that what you say has paved a vision
And maybe the next generation of babys will get born into safety
And break these barriers down, that we've been carrying 'round
And break free from the massive amounts

With times gone by in his hands
Listen To The Old Man
If you can't find no advice where you stand
Listen To The Old Man

When they're wrong... who's gonna bury my mind?
Every grave digger dies
Every grave digger dies
When they're wrong... who's gonna bury my body?
When they're wrong... who's gonna bury my body?

[Verse 1: Ali Bla Bla]
Living life round this sin, it's how it's been since powers in
Many men pump weight in the council gym, producing ounces in student houses
We choose this outfit 'coz we like to win, but what lies within these lies within? (huh?)
It's like everyone's Breaking Bad, cooking up food to make it fat (oh!)
The streets are cold man, not a smile around in this whole land
Some warm to a life of thrills in William Hill, before it goes all down
Posers medal in the game, a generation wild in abundance
No patience, style over substance, like using heroin in vein

Fuck Knows! In the Olympics the love flowed
But when this rat race falls down on its fat face, I hope you've got enough Gold
Yeah fuck silver, I've got enough Bolts that if it all screwed I'm going nuts yo
I've got enough clothes, but the greed law says we need more
Do you feel my genes? Social validation agents can kill my dreams
Two shots to the dome, my ego is still my theme
When Lady Gaga and Kim K can fill my screens
I wonder what real life needs are gonna fill my seeds

[Chorus: Danny Wilder]
Mother there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions some wrong some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

[Hook: Danny Wilder]
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

[Drop: Danny Wilder & Ali Bla Bla]
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

I smoke the chung while my heart bleeds burgundy
Stuck on the title page, still yearning to turn the sheet
(Come on)

This book of lies got me shook of life
Still picturing crooked ties
I must of mistook for right
Getting licked again and again
Whether the venom is peng
It severs several levels in head
But for some reason, I'm several levels ahead of these
Sheep and cattle, wannabes wannabe street and battle
But many die in war, that's a fact
In the pursuit of glory, men will attack intact no looking back
Bang!

[Bridge: Danny Wilder]
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too

[Break: Sample]
Stand the fuck up

[Drop: Danny Wilder & Koken]
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

Bumped into the devil up at the crossroads
Searching for lost souls
Picking them up in bulk like Costco's
And whoever's written my life movie
Done gave me some plot holes
But made me sharp enough so I clocked those
The times it was too late
The penny just dropped slow
Cause people are scared when they shoot the sheriff
But not when they shot Os
And that's how far you go
To cop those designer jeans
And It's a no-brainer

[Chorus: Danny Wilder]
Mother there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions some wrong some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

[Verse 1]
I could swear by the blue
In the sea and the sky
It's red and it's black
I can see in your eye
One colour is danger
The other is hate
You said I was good
But could never be great
In the morning the razor cuts my skin
You cut me down just for asking the truth
Please kill me
Don't
Refuse

[Chorus]
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know

[Verse 2]
Wanna scream
Wanna shout
For the dreams
But many doubts
And your brain is feeling suffocated
Don't be silly
Let it out
Or I'm giving up
If you got bluffs
I'ma ring it up
I don't want much
If I did enough
Then I'm not fussed
If I give it up
From the jump
Lies are a lose-lose when
I can I can land on the proof
But I'ma need a few good men
That can that can handle the truth
So please don't wait
Please don't lie to my face
Waste my time and my space
Stakes are high don't hesitate

[Chorus]
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me

[Verse 3]
Been thinkin' lately
Maybe you ain't so clean
When you say Ali come hold me
Wonder why you're lonely
Maybe there's somethin' your bluffin'
Could I trust that you woulda told me
's not like I have proof
But I have a few damn clues
Like them texts
From your ex
That read devil-like man you
I plan to find out soon
Maybe I do feel guilty
I've done a few things filthy
And it kills me that I've lied
What can I can I say, I'm a guy

If there's something I should know

Under my skin, chases after all the blues. Look out for the king, in the writers and lost
This will be uncertain this will be ruins
Born in the light, cast a shadow of our love. Thinking the sun, blurring innocence of tired. We all know, you all wrong
Out of the night, was so long I can't recall. Chasing after night, at the end of so to fall. Did you know so much home
Lost the purpose execution. Every knows, wouldn't be so easy. We've only hold a dream

Soon as 'down the street

With eyes and ears
We can see in here
But with lips and mouths
We can kiss and shout
Let's take our hands
And use them to feel
Then we can rest
And then we can heal
And let's take our back
And carry the weight
Open yourself
Before it's too late

I need to treasure every minute
The fact that I'm here and I'm living within it
Sometimes I feel like the pace of my life's too fast
And I think about the time that's passed
I can't remember what happened yesterday
The day before, or anything, at any rate, anyway
I think what I'm trying to say is
I don't wanna live a life like this

[Chorus]
What happens when it all goes black
And I'm lying there dying and I'm trying to think back
And I can't seem to conjure up anything
And the fear consumes me as they start to lose me
What happens when it all goes black
And I'm lying there dying and I'm trying to think back
And I can't seem to conjure up anything
No, because I haven't done anything

I feel like I've lead a pretty happy life
Then how come all I can remember is the strife
Fear comes and it takes its hold
And I'm afraid of getting old
And then suddenly I need a way out
Because I can't just let my memories fade in and fade out
I need something new
But I'm stuck with what to do

[Chorus]

"
99379,"

We're all walking through to no man's land
But no one understands there's a war in our hands
Keeping minds blank and replies frank
Or someone else is taking you to the bank

Everyone's so used to being used
That it means nothing on the frontpage news
Everyone's so used to being used
That it means nothing on the frontpage news

Everybody says it's getting better all the time
But it's bad still bad (x4)

We're all waiting, endless kill
Afraid to get in front of me
I'll get in front of you
All for one and one for none
Step out of line we'll get now? with the gun

And if business goes as planned
There's no time to take a stand (x2)

Everybody says it's getting better all the time
But it's bad still bad (x4)

There's gotta be a better way
But I just can't say what will make it okay
If I had just one wish
I'd wish for this, I'd wish for justice (x2)
I know there's a better way
But I just can't say what will make it okay
If I had just one wish
I'd wish for this, I'd wish for justice (x2)

In a room
In a tomb, with a broom
Tried to sweep away
The clouds and the gloom
Daylight savings
And pencil shavings
Scrawl on the wall
Predictions of the fall

[Chorus]
But I don't mind
But I don't mind
No I don't mind
No I don't mind

[Verse 2]
You've got your mother's hands
And your father's heart
Making plans where you stand
And when you'll start
Slow motion
Next to the ocean
Making rounds, breaking down
Without a sound

[Chorus]
But I don't mind
But I don't mind
No I don't mind
No I don't mind

[Verse 3]
I still recognize
You're in your disguise
I think I'll pull the wool
Over my own eyes
'Cause I don't wanna see
Me
Enraptured, fractured
And captured

[Chorus]
But I don't mind
But I don't mind
I don't mind, wanna see your mind
I don't mind, wanna be your mind

I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool over my own eyes
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool over my own eyes
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool over my own eyes
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool
I think I'll pull the wool over my own eyes

Too much information
Too much stimulation
Reality, or a fallacy?
I can't believe, I can't perceive

Medicate
Is it the only way?

Find it hard to unplug
So reach for your favorite drug
Technology, extension of me
I can't believe, I can't perceive

Self-medicate

Is it the only way?

I'm a robot from the 20th Century
I am designed to never feel anything
My operating system runs on complacency
I think it's fine, it doesn't really bother me

I have seen You up on the hillside
Blowing in the rain
Seen Your shadow pass by my window
Coloured silver grey
I have seen You chasing the winter
Snow marks out Your way
Crystal breezes bringing the springtime
Never a day the same
O little Heaven inside me
Let me speak Your name
O little Heaven beside me
Come to heal my pain
For I wont forget
And you wont regret
Giving me your name
I have seen Your hand in the passing
Of each and every day
And the listening breathe in Your influences
Leaving each one changed
So why is Your name so hard to find?
So hard to reach?
Why cant we say?
When its so easy children can form it
Locked somewhere inside me it remains

Un jour, dans le soir en Automne, lac Balaton
Comme au rendez-vous des madones, lac Balaton
On voit s'avancer une ondine, au bout des seins deux églantines
Sur l'herbe mouillée de la rive, un enfant, lui crie, ""ils arrivent""

Je vois à travers le brouillard
Des cavaliers et des boyards
Sur des cavades en furies
Ornées de cuir de tartarie
Le chef, un géant silencieux
S'avance, et alors sur le lac
Gris, vert, orange et bleu de rage
C'est la tempête, c'est l'orage

Même quand les dieux vous abandonnent, lac Balaton
Le sable est doux comme une pomme, lac Balaton
Doux, comme un oiseau qu'on assomme, lac Balaton
Un jour, vers le soir en Automne, lac Balaton

Les starfighters et les stukas
Font éclater en gerbes énormes
Les pastèques et les paprikas
Je ne suis qu'un parmi les hommes
Je ne suis qu'un parmi les hommes

You can show me everything I ever knew

Like a ghost in town
But I give my new a flying form

Let's cancel our plans
Let go of my hands
We cancel our plans
And start over with our first dance
Until the song ends
Please let me pretend
Until the song ends
Will you act like your not my boyfriend

Pretend you're not my boyfriend
And dance with my head on your shoulder
Pretend you're not my boyfriend
So you can ask me out all over
Take off those dress shoes
Show me some dance moves

Take off those black shoes
And run around this dirty ballroom
Until the song's through
Pretend you're old news
Until the song's through
Oh will you act like I don't know you

Pretend like I don't know you
As if we were a few years younger
Pretend like I don't know you

Blinded -- by the stars in my eyes

[1990]
I'm too young to be jaded 21 and I ain't made it
But you gotta keep your head up -- keep fighting until you famous
F-f-f-faded
I swear I'm so high that I'd probably float away if
My wallet wasn't so weighted
Acts as my anchor, my rock, Toronto hold me down
I was lonely growing up in the city an only child
But I am older now and I have honed my style
Took a shot at my dreams ch ch ch BLAOW and I hope it counts
Don't cry no tears for me mama, this is what I want to do
Walk a day in my shoes and you'll find out that it's hard to move
So watch your step, a beast is on the loose
Breathing fire out his mouth smoking marijuana fumes
Broken chains off -- Love Thy Brother cut it like a chainsaw
It's been game on since the motherfucking face-off
Middle finger to the world I'm about to take on
This is not no Trey Songs -- did you get your brains wrong?
This is warrior music where warriors do it for real
So grab your piece and lick a shot in the sky -- we're clear
I'm being sincere when I say that we're here this year
So pick up your beers and cheers and wipe those frickin tears UH

[Saidah]
Blinded -- by the stars in my eyes

[Beanz]
How it hurts -- well it hurts to speak with a sense of urgency
Just to murk these beats
And I rap til my lips stay bloody and chapped
And they categorize me as the ruggedest cat
Til my fan's hands clap -- did ya holdin the strap
Niggas know I rap -- throw my city on my back T DOT
Show my city where it's at
Focus on my cash and working til I'm laying in a casket
It hurts but there's money in it
At first it was all about doing something drastic
Now it's all about this rap shit SO
When you see me on the corner of my city flipping CDS
H-h-holla at me man
Now the man stays DIESEL, flexing everywhere that he go
Not his muscles, just his ego
This one's for my people T -- O
Everyone stand up -- throw ya god damn hands up

[Saidah]
Blinded -- by the stars in my eyes
Take a sip - stars in my eyes
Devil's water -- stars in my eyes

Amazing dirty girls
All that bright around
And the flashes are killing eyes

You whisper my soul
My sweet lady
I won’t sleep no more

I can feel no more

Through my soul

Come on
One more
Just hold me baby until the top
She will not
Let me go… let me go… let me go… let me go…

Now come on me
And get in
And get out
And get in
Just put it on me
And get out
And get in
And get out
Just come and get in

Dancing like a puppet
Ignoring all the stupid faces
While the speakers sound
Are crushing all my nerves

You kick my nose
Mystic girl
I will stay so long

I can feel no more
You know what to do
I feel your trip
Through my soul

One more
Come on
Just hold me baby until the top
She will not
Let me go… let me go… let me go… let me go

And get in
And get out
And get in
Just put it on me
And get out
And get in
And get out
Just come and get in

I’ve been working like a demon, day and night
Trying to find something that’ll chill my mind
Yeah, fiddling and foostering away my time
With crepuscular soliloquies
And half-distilled pigeon-willed brain moonshine
Plans and schemes and pipe dreams with a twist of lime
So if the way you see yourself seems a tad unkind
Stop in your tracks, relax, and grab a piece of mind

It’s not the crowd’s rush, not the rocks thrust
Not your disgust, not the tired faces
Not used-to-be-nice places, bombast
Not the bombs blast, clocks that run fast
Not artless provocation, academic masturbation
It’s not the spinning round, dizzy
Greyhound-skirt herd of dirtbirds
Out in this weather?
Parents should know better

It’s the unconscious dose
RSI-in-the-wrist ghosts
Aspire to exist only
In a daze while they expire slowly
Screen-stealers
Our dream-weavers
The team-leaders
And time-bleeders
Know where they’ll lead us
Nowhere to lead us
Nowhere

Your brain’s under beta strain
Think only in terms of gain
Your heart and your soul
Are not coming back again
Forget all you used to know
Your brain needs relaxing when you’ve been
Working like a demon

"

I’m digging it out
I’m building it now
It’s in the ground
I’m digging it now

While plucking on these bass strings
I long for neon shores
My Janus face sings “There’s me, and me on tour”
Sleepless blood is racing
My edges curl with fire
In heated anticipation
Of a ride to somewhere higher
Higher

I’m passed-out on the coat-tails
Just being dragged along
The dusty broken glass trails
Of some old bastard’s song
Still...it’s the life of legends
Rubbing shoulders with the bards
Ignoring cries of dead-ends
Head is older, heart is hard
Heart is hard
So hard

I’m digging it out
It’s something to get freaky about
I’m building it now
It’s reinforced for when shit gets loud
It’s in the ground
A fallout shelter for this Late Late town
I’m digging a hole
A reservoir for my soul

I’m going through the motions
It’s a venomous waste of days
I’m sick and tired of all these wires
This jaded, bloodless maze
A man of few emotions
My fun is just part-time
I’m done with feeling sixty
Vexted, reeling twenty-five
I’m done with going through the motions
Floundering in oceans of acidic soul-corrosion
It’s drawing to a close
So this show's on me

"
103830,"

You say that I’m falling from grace right now?
The back of your head has my face
How it howls!
“I’ll see you when you come down tomorrow”
This shit’s been such a let down
Too little too late
Two insurmountable walls you erect
I’ve bashed my skull off them all
And yet you’ve clawed at every work-round
No, no, no
I’m black and blue and broke down
Too little too late

I’m sorry to say that we’ve come to the end of the line
The dreams that you cling to just ain’t gonna ring true this time
Dissolving our smiles into piles at the scene of the crime
We never did have that aforementioned whale of a time
No!

This is where I sulk...
And see how much you like it! Too childish?
Come on and undermine it
Too little too late
I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul
Gave me a hatful of impurities, doubt, insecurities
Take em and make em yours!
Make em yours
That’s give and take

Save me from this importunity and bury me in a shallow grave
Where fortune shares serenity with what’s left of me
Dig me up, send me some other place where loving hands can fix me
Into some delightful shape
A brand new man

"
103831,"

The winter stripped my muscles bare
Black icicles and solitaire
And no one seemed to hang around
This nowhere
Hallucinations fill the air
Old bicycles and rusty hair
That disappear without a sound
When I stare

Give me a sign, oh lord
Something that’s mine
I’ve heard what’s right for you won’t pass you by

So a secret season rolls around
Spreads fresh white carpet on the ground
Yet currents warm and perfumes fair
Seem to surround me
Til I’m swept away
In a spectacular daze
The unpredictability of now seems to say

“Wear your cloak, your gratitude
Seek out your folk, the righteous few
With gentle words and energy”
May what I deserve come back to me

[Verso]
A maior demonstração
De propagação do ser é o eco
Com ele meu grito tem força
Pra derrubar todos os prédios

[Refrão 1]
Que não me deixam ver o sol
Eles não deixam eu ver o sol
Que não me deixam ver o sol
E eles não deixam eu ver o sol

Que não me deixam ver o sol
Eles não deixam eu ver o sol
Que não me deixam ver o sol
Pra me prender nesse labirinto de tédio

[Ponte]
(Instrumental)

[Refrão 2]
Que não me deixam ver o sol
Eles não deixam eu ver o sol
Que não me deixam ver o sol
E eles não deixam eu ver o sol

Que não me deixam ver o sol
Eles não deixam eu ver o sol
Que não me deixam ver o sol
Pra me prender nesse labirinto de tédio

"
104065,"

Alto, tão alto
Pra ninguém me enxergar
Passo a passo
Pra ninguém me derrubar

Correr por fora
Mas sempre ao centro

Alto, tão alto
Pra ninguém me alcançar
Passo a passo
Pois longe vou devagar

Correr por fora
Mas sempre ao centro
Despreocupar

"
104066,"

Não vou falar, vou fazer
Pois ação vale mais que mil palavras
Não vou pensar em viver
Pois só pensar não me levou a nada

Vou sentir pra não mais mentir
Vou agir pra não mais fingir
Eu vou ser pra ser
Não vou ser pra ter

Hoje aprendi a voar
Sem sair do lugar
Do lugar

Vou sentir pra não mais mentir
Vou fingir pra não mais agir
Vou sentir

Ser pra ser
Ou não ser pra ter

104068,"

Por trás do que eu sinto
Por trás do que eu sinto
Por trás do que eu sinto
Existem mais de mil complicações
Que juntas se transformam em direções
E no final já são quase milhões

Eu quero o infinito
Eu quero o infinito
Eu quero o infinito
Não tudo, mas todo ele em frações
Para que eu possa ser as emoções
De corpo e alma, sem limitações

The tide is on the brink of extinction
The sky is on the verge of collapse
The birds and the trees all are falling like leaves
The memories are floating away

The cabins on the shore are abandoned
The streets are just a river of dust
The ships on the bay all go sailing away
And they won't be back here again

"
104286,"

Flutter by, butterfly Into the sky, into the sky
Till you're out of sight
And I won't run, I won't fight

I've got my feet on the ground

Little bird, say the word
And I will be there, I will be there
With my hands held high
And I will reach to the sky

I've got my feet on the ground
Little bee, follow me
Into the field, into the field
Where I clipped your wings
And I will wait for your sting
I've got my feet on the ground

Sometimes I wanna take it from a little to a lot
And I am spinning in a circle like a dizzy little top
And I am calling all the people I'd forgotten about
And trying to tell them that I figured it out
But it's a lie and all the stupid things

I say and do and never really stop when
I should never have begun
I really oughtta drop it
But it's faster when you don't even have time to stop and think
About the things that you are saying cuz they really never matter
But it's Empty spaces in the air
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh no, oh no

All the million little empty spaces in the air
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh no, oh no, oh no

But I...
Never was a fighter and I never was a poet
And I never was a writer though you'd never really know it
Cuz I'm full of all the knowledge that you needed to know
And I will share it if you're ready or not
Because I know I heard

That Jami was a Wicked fan and Timmy's dropping out
And all the other little things that I was thinking about
Like how mosquitoes have malaria and dogs have lice
I could go on for half an hour cuz I hate to leave a million little

Empty spaces in the air
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh no, oh no
All the million little empty spaces in the air
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh

Economy of speech is not a virtue, it's a sin
Because I never want to tell you once
What I could say again and again and again...

I know you wanna tell me what you think of what I'm say
I promise you that I will give you time later to weigh in
To weigh in if you want to

But I forgot to tell you
I was heading out to take my puppy for a walk
But then the strangest little thing came out and ran across the sidewalk
It might have been a squirrel or a chipmunk or a prairie dog
But something 'bout the tail wasn't right
But that's another story...

Everyone just stopped and stared with blank expressions motionless
And for a second everything was silent and commotionless...
I turned I said to Fluffy, that's a cute little sciuridae and then it went scampering off
But that was better than the
Empty spaces in the air
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh no, oh no
All the million little empty spaces in the air
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh no, oh no...

Fill it up, fill it up, fill it up...

Cold hands, sore feet
You've been walking for an hour on abandoned streets
Weak knees, and fresh scars
It's a struggle when you're losing track of who you are
The words you stole won't save your soul
They can only buy you time
Light a candle, or curse the dark
It's all the same to me
Start a fire, or drown the spark
And shake away the heat
Tell the truth or live a lie
Just don't close your eyes

Let down, and so spent
You've been holding up the world with your good intent
Help out, like you should
It's a burden that you never really understood
But Caroline, I'm doing fine
It's the others who are dying
Light a candle, or curse the dark
It's all the same to me
Start a fire, or drown the spark
And shake away the heat
Tell the truth or live a lie
Just don't close your eyes
And you're breaking
But you're faking nothing's ever wrong
And concealing what you're feeling
Always standing strong
But you don't need
To act like you don't bleed
When you come falling down
Cuz there is no healing when you're not feeling
Anything at all

Light a candle, or curse the dark
It's all the same to me
Start a fire, or drown the spark
And shake away the heat
Tell the truth or live a lie

Just don't close your eyes

"

In 1912, I was only a boy
Hardly 10 years old
The summer was dry, the sun in the sky
Where secrets burn like matches

In my Sunday best, I went down for a walk
To Billy Barnum's house
He was alone, no one was home
So I had an idea

I said to Billy, ""let's go walking down in the ravine
There's no one here for miles so we never will be seen
If your folks are in Peoria, they won't be back for hours
So let's go have some fun.""

We walked down through the tangle of trees
I lost my bearing twice
But then we emerged, the top of the earth
And watched in silent wonder

We stood tall on the edge of the bridge
When a gust of wind blew through
I stumbled and weaved, and reached for his sleeve
To try and find my balance

But Billy lost his footing and he slipped off of the edge
He caught himself with one hand on an overhanging ledge
But his strength would only last him for a minute, maybe two
Then he crashed down in the river
He crashed down in the river

A shallow grave on the outskirts of town
Is where I laid him down
A secret it's stayed, what happened that day
With me and Billy Barnum
With me and Billy Barnum

Take this pill, my dear
It will keep you sharp and clear
The side effects won't last too long

It's stranger than it seems
In your most peculiar dreams
But it's nothing that won't fade with time

Tuck the northern star in a candy jar
And save it for a rainy day

Shadows in the moonlight
Always coming, always going
While your cup is overflowing

Shadows in the moonlight
Just a matter of perspective
It's all relative, subjective
It's alive

Stand up straight and tall
Keep your back against the wall
Remember what they said to you

A stranger in a crowd
A halo on a cloud
It's lost to you but it never really went away

The muffled speech is out of reach
But truth has got a way of breaking through

(Chorus)
Take these words my dear
And as they echo in your ears
It's closer than you think

(Chorus x 2)

"
104291,"

The cold moon is shining
And the stars are aligning
And I'm here knocking on your door

It's two in the morning
And we both should be snoring
But you're far too lovely to ignore

So let's go out and raise some hell
Do what you want, I'll never tell
And yeah, I know I've been a little slow
But hey... I'm good to go

I'm snared and I'm smitten
Like a scared little kitten
But I'm not afraid to tell you anymore

I gave up denying
And I stopped always trying
To avoid the things that freaked me out before

I was afraid of fear itself
It took so long to leave this shell
And yeah, I know I've been a little slow
But hey... I'm good to go

I know I've been distant
So detached and resistant
To the things that are perfect in my life

I once was a hermit
But inside I was yearning just to
Take off the mask and see the light

And it was you who made me see
You gave me hope, and set me free
And yeah, I know I've been a little slow
But hey... I'm good to go

"
104292,"

I saw your face, painted on the wall
Shapeless in space, colorless and small
I remember you, faded and subdued

I spent the day, haunted by your sight
Hiding away, curse away the light
I remember you, fading out of view

You're a memory now
You're all faded and brown
You're just namelessly hung
On the tip of my tongue in a silent remark

You're a memory now
You're just dust on the ground
Just a whisper of steam on the crest of a dream
While I walk in the dark
You're a memory now

Sheltered and safe, hidden and concealed
Your timid face, never was revealed
Shaded from the light, tepid and so slight

Shake off the dust, wipe away the years
Scrape off the rust, nothing more appears
I've been through it all, still I can't recall

(Chorus)

"
104293,"

Take this down to where the streets are cold and nameless
Just be sure to watch your back cuz they will
Find you and attack you without warning
There's trouble all around this place and danger in the strangest face
If you get lost along the way just close your eyes and softly say
The silent words you never heard when you were sleeping soundly in your bed

They won't go away
They don't leave
They won't go away
They don't sleep

We have only just begun to see the future
In the corner of our eyes a little circle will arise and start to take you
The ships are sailing in the bay and they won't leave till they've been paid
And everyone's been bought and sold but no one's worth their weight in gold
It's only just a feeling but the devil has been dealing all the cards

They won't go away
They don't leave
They won't go away
They don't sleep

"

What's your favorite color?
Why does summer make you sad?
Do you crave the snow?
Where did you get your favorite pair of shoes?
Oh, I wanna know

All the things that make you sing
And tap your little toes
Oh, I wanna know

Did you cry when your father said goodbye?
Did he leave a note?
Do you scream when you wake up from a dream?
Oh, I wanna know

I want to hear between your ears
And swim inside your brain
Oh, I wanna know

I want to know the thin and thick
What makes you smile, what makes you tick
I want to know what gets you out of bed

Yeah, you're a mystery to me
And I'm not asking for the key
But I hope that you will let me in the door

Would you run if I told you you're the one?
Would you stay or go?
Could it be you've been waiting here for me?
Oh, I wanna know

Don't make me wait, just tell me straight
Before I have to go
Oh, I wanna know
Oh, I wanna know

"
104295,"

Rainbow, waiting by my window
Rainbow, singing at my door
And the Georgia pines and dandelions are bobbing in the careless summer breeze

Sunshine, skipping on the sidewalk
Sunshine, but not as bright as you
When you shattered free, you blined me, and now I'm seeing stars around my head

And it's all I know
You're the afterglow
That never fades

Tadpole, squiggle in the water
Tadpole, dancing toward the light
From a pollywog into a frog in twenty seconds flat, well how 'bout that?

Mayfly, skimming on the water
Mayfly, only for a day
And if love is just a fleeting whim, then why is it you never dimmed away?

And it's all I know
You're the afterglow
That never fades

After all these years
Of living in your shadow
After all these years
Of bathing in your light
The only thing I know
Is you're the afterglow
That never fades

My love, brighter than a diamond
My love, shining like the sun
But I never try to close my eyes, I never want to hide you in the dark

And it's all I know
You're the afterglow
That never fades

And it's all I know
You're the afterglow
So just take it slow
Until the sun falls low
Then light me up

Far away but not long ago
I saw a man with a golden soul
He saw no right but he spoke no wrong
He wrote no writ but he sang no song

Today's the day he said to me
I'll cut your chains and it'll set you free
Now there ain't no-one to tell you how
To fight your fight or to take your bow

But Lo! Behold!
It ain't so nice
Alot of long car rides
Alot of cold cold nights
Cause it ain't that easy being free from yourself
When you ain't got no-one and no books on your shelf

And now, you see, I'm free from a sin!
From love, from pain, or any trouble I've been in
But who needs trouble when you got love
Who needs love, its too much trouble, for some

"
104586,"

Got a pretty woman gone treat me
Like a earthquake and a whirlwind

Always try to treat me tender
But bites like the cold of december

Yea yea yea
Yea yae yae

Everyday I sit and I wonder
I sure as hell ain't getting any younger

I just want to wander and ramble
Take a few strides on a gamble

Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea

I wanna be a wanderer babe
I wanna be a rambling man

"

Hey hey mister
Mister right
Hey hey mister
Mister wrong

Hey hey trouble
Trouble and strife
Hey hey sorrow
Won't you be my wife?

Woman woman
Tell me your name
Let me have my
Life reclaimed

Waiting, wondering
All my life
Tryin' to love you
With all of my might

I'm the soul challenger
I'm the rogue damager
Now behold the cold
And the straight magical

Because the sky brings the floods
As the strong go weary
The heroes spill blood
In a blast and a fury

Pray on the power
And prey to your father
Because all of the quakes
In the universe resonate
To your heart beat and your fate

Now break it on down for me

Grade a lover
With a brown eyed stare
Take me from my
Life of dispair

Hold me closely
Whisper in my ear
I got my own reason
Why i love you my dear

Hey hey lady
Lady in white
Open your arms and
Enlighten my sight

Comfort and carry me
To my new home
Open your heart
Let your soul free to roam

Get back out and
Make your brain take some facts in
Make your hands start to clap then
Unh, hear the power of whats happening
All the waves are a crashing
All the throats are gasping
All the triggers are fascined
All the lights are a flashing
All to the rhythm of my passion

"
104588,"

Pay the toll
To the sky
Shame the fool
To the road

Rake the fire
Make the gold
Take desire
From the bold

Curl a smile
From strife
'Till everyone has life
Worth the while
Worth the wait
Worth the food on your plate

Hold your tounge
Cock your gun
Let everyone have some
So they share
What they bare
And they all know what you've done

What you've done
What you've done
To break the sun
Break the sun
What have you done?

War
Down to the ocean floor
Let them hear your roar
Tiger of the shore

Lies
Wind inside your eyes
Let out your battle cries
Rider in disguise

Loud
Everywhere the sound
Shaking through the ground
And everywhere around

Break
Make the earth quake
And for the sun forsake
Let all the people shake

Open up your eyes
See inside your lives
See where your vision lies
Your brother as your guide

When earths is set on fire
With all the worlds desire
When fear dreams to aspire
The righteous will inspire

The sun
Wheres the sun?
What have you done?

"
104589,"

Everything goes my way when i want it to
Everything rises above my soul

Everyone wants to be my friend indeed
What I want and what I need

I look up to my love and to my peace
Stay awake for a while and breathe my breath

But if it don't matter then it matters to me!
To the edge of space and the botom of the sea

I only know where to make my home
But never when to stay and when to go

Where's the love I know?
I want to know

Where's the peace I know?
I want to know

So tell me man, tell me man, tell me man, tell me
So tell me man, tell me man, tell me
So tell me man, tell me man, tell me man
Where's the peace on earth? (x4)

Why don't you get along
Come on people now
You ain't the only soul
It this world you know

Whether you're right or wrong
Or teach a man to fish
Or say I take it I'll make it
And I can't stop this shaking

'Cause we all feel low
And we all feel high
But it ain't so hard
To keep on getting on by

Brothers and sisters
Take your hands
We ain't gone give it up
Gone take our stand

If this the way its gone stay
We can't keep lookin' away
Tommorrows just one more day
Come on people just say

Where's the peace on earth?

[Verse 1]
There's a place I know
There's some people there
That I know are evil
But I just don't care

There's a feeling in me
That I can't control
It's a type of sorrow
That'll hurt my soul

I can be my own
Type of lover man
But I won't go on
Until I understand

I hear the thunderclap!
I hear the wind and rain
It's a rip in space
It's my cold hard shame

Oh doctor, doctor
Please cure what's ailing me
Please give me a perscription
And make my heart free

[Hook]
There's a revolution
There's an execution
There's a resistance
There's a new feeling
Rising up and through my bones

[Verse 2]
There's a place I know!
Where the wind don't blow
There's a place I know
Where you don;t want to go
There's a place i know
Where the evil shows
In the light of day

I hear the sun coming back
I see the moon is off it's track

The stars and heavens
The story leavens
The plot keeps thickening
But the love is quickening

Into sand
Don't you understand
There's a whole
Lot of trouble more

I see a hurracane
I see the wind and rain
I see a shallow figure
And its my cold hard shame

[Hook]
There's a revolution
There's an execution
There's a resistance
There's a new feeling
Rising up and through my bones

Scrape, take till he breaks
Your independent shit is just so fake
Hot shot till he bought
Now your job is spending his hard got
You beached leech who battle bleeds
Protecting both sides of your Hane's panties
Your Trump gun is your son
He wishes he could shove it back where it’s from

You know he means it

And now he’s mine, babe
Don’t care what your contract says
His hunger’s for me
And I keep him well fed

Stage, page your outrage
You’re just finally getting what you gave
Hop top your soap box
With how much you consume you’ll just fall off
To be sweet you think is weak
But one smile at him and we adulteried
You smug slug call your judge
I don’t want half his stuff just all his love

You know I mean it

And now he’s mine, babe
Don’t care what your paper says
His thoughts are all me
The life that’s in his head

And now he’s mine, babe
Don’t care what your last name says
He comes just for me
The wife that’s in his head

Until they stooped to tell me
I never knew I was disturbed
Until they dropped three volumes on me
But in the Bible/Torah/Quran
There're really no good roles for me

Now I just want to stab 'em

So they can legally bind us
They needed to have the church
So they can morally ground us
They've needed most of the dough
They must be so scared of us
So their stories are of ghosts

I only wish the virgin
Would've had an abortion

So composed but it's so severe
In repose, but it's so severe
You're so calm, but it's so severe
How are you calm when it's so severe?
So severe, so--
Why are we still talking about it?!

Schooled Southside beneath the King of Beasts, back in PigFat, St. Louis
The air was gravid with heat, sex, and hops
They made the beer, drank it when they got off
“This is what you gotta do.”
But, I just want to scratch the groove
No
No
No

Pick a partner
Pick a dom-icile
My choice was to pick them all
Lying, flying, like men blankly do
“Girl, yer in the wrong neighborhood.”
“This is what you gotta do.”
But, I don't care
I'll smash the groove

“This is what you gotta do now.”
“This is what you gotta do now.”
This is what you must do, but I'm going to rough up the groove

Tat-for-tit, you always gave me shit
'cuz I DID NOT DRESS LIKE A FEMINIST
Now you've had your so important baby
Who will grow to do graphics for Old Navy
“This is what you gotta do.”
But, not me
Please
I'll pound the groove



“This is what you gotta do now.”
“This is what you gotta do now.”
This is what you must do, but I'm going to rough-up the groove

Watch that movie
Watch it
Watch it
Watch me
Found me bottom-up, bottled-up, and refused since eye-ope
But, he saw a suck, picked me up, and my spirit poured
We lived mouth to mouth, mouth to south, hands around my neck
Until shake to shout, shattered 'bout passed-out
Lost count somewhat
But, I could feel that call
And where else could I go?
He said I had special powers, and saved my pitiful life

Watch that movie
Watch it
Watch it
Watch me
Found him there that night, last in line of a trail of bottles
Dying soldier who only slew the much weaker ones
I stood there blinking, there drinking in the weight of the moment
And cupped my hands to hold the last drops and thought
“Should I make that call?
“Should I let time go?
“Should I call upon all my powers and save his pitiful life?”

The lights: midnight fluorescing
Location: out-skirts and down
And time's suspending

I make that call
That call
That call, that call, that call, that call

Watch it
Watch it
Watch me
Found out that he did, finally did do it: drowned his sorrows
Six years down I can't, still I can't dilute the thought:
That I'd bet there was someone there, a head clearer than mine was
Who said “You're just an empty beer bottle, bottle, bottle, bottle,”
And never made that call
Took the chance to go
She knew she had special powers, and saved her pitiful life

I was a waiter in North Baltimore
Down by the tracks and the video store where you worked
Three times a day you'd come in for a drink
I'd bring you a coffee, you'd pay with a wink and a smile

One day I saw you and pulled up a stool
I said, ""Kathy, I've known you since first grade in school on the bus""
You always had talked about seeing the world
I never imagined you'd still be the girl down the street

I asked, ""why are you still here?"", you just looked confused
You told me you can't get from here to Peru in a car
In Panama you'll hit the Darién Gap
There's suddenly nothing but white on the map and you're done...

You are done
You are done
You're done

We are one but not quite connected
We are one but light years apart
We are one but not quite connected
We are one oh oh

Now it's been so long since I wandered away
But I still think about what you told me that day in the bar
I wonder if you're still marooned with a globe
Waiting for someone to pave you a road to your dreams

The tiptoes on the bedroom floor
These quiet eyes are spinning in the dark
The secret wish that none will know
She keeps it locked up in her pale heart

Wait for it, it's tired and it's true
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She dreams in blue
She dreams in blue
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

The background hum of city streets
And whispers from the neighbors intertwine
The distant glow of beacon lights are
Breaking through the cracks between the blinds

Wait for it, it's hiding out of view
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She dreams in blue
She dreams in blue
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She opens up her weary eyes
The foggy cloud of vision fills the air
She strains to make some sense of all the
Abstract shapes and colors everywhere

But all the blue just fades away dissolving in a haze of grey
And lost inside her empty mind is everything she tried to find
And all the blue just fades away, she lost it in a haze of grey

She dreams in blue
She dreams in blue
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

Let's pretend that this is real
Let's say this really is the deal
The way you put me out
It makes me doubt my sanity

Toe the line until it breaks
You savor all of your mistakes
And then you do whatever pleases you
It's all you know

Clean me and hang me out to dry
Screaming and live another lie
You make it seem so effortless

Grace is never the reward
It's a price you never could afford
You can count your change
But you can't exchange your dignity

Sell your soul and pay the rent
Be sure you count up every cent
Cause when you lose your aim
In this dirty game you're through

Clean me and hang me out to dry
Screaming and live another lie
You make it seem so effortless

Clean me and hang me out to dry
Scheming until the day you die
You make it seem so effortless

I sat down
With a sharpened pencil in my hand
You were in my head and I had planned
To write you into verses and
Immortalize your virtues for a hundred years to come

And then I thought
About our tiny little history
You once had struck me as a mystery
Now I wonder what I used to see
And this empty page is screaming that
You're just like all the rest

Oh oh, oh oh, untitled
Oh oh, oh oh, untitled

You were real
Yeah, I swear I thought I knew you
But now my eyes just stare right through you
And I don't think I can blame you
Yeah, I saw what I was looking for, and pushed aside the rest

But I was wrong
No, it's not like you're an ogre
It's just you're bland and mediocre
I am drunk and you are sober yeah
This song won't ever write itself so you best be on your way

Oh oh, oh oh, untitled
Oh oh, oh oh, untitled

Easy come
It's not like art's some kind of charity
I guess a true muse is a rarity
The kind that gives your mind the clarity
To leave that empty page behind

Oh oh, oh oh, untitled
Oh oh, oh oh, untitled oh oh
I'm stuck without a spark of pain or joy
There's nothing, nothing
I'm stuck without a spark of pain or joy

"
105054,"

You look like hell tonight, I don't believe this sight
I haven't seen you since we had that awful fight
It's been so long since I, I heard you say goodbye
And now I don't know what to say

Why are you standing here, why did you reappear
I thought you'd had enough, of all this stupid stuff
You wanted more from me, a perfect symmetry
But I just wasn't ever right

Go back into the darkness from whence you came
Go back into the darkness and stop these games
Oh I don't know what you want from me
I gave you all that I could be
So take this pocket of angels and go away

You always wanted more than I was ready for
I gave you what I could and faked a little more
I'd found the secret key, to perfect symmetry
And now you're back and I am lost

Go back into the darkness from whence you came
Go back into the darkness and stop these games
Oh I don't know what you want from me
I gave you all that I could be
So take this pocket of angels and go away

Oh, can't you see, that I'd landed on my feet
And I am doing just fine, I am doing just fine
I don't need you to beg or to plead
All the things that you need, all the things that you need

Go back into the darkness from whence you came
Go back into the darkness and stop these games
I don't know what you want from me
I gave you all that I could be
So take this pocket of angels and go away
Take this pocket of angels and go away

I don't wanna be in Findlay cause it goes to bed at nine
I don't wanna be in Bowling Green because it's plastered all the time
I don't wanna be in Lima cause there's nothing there to do
I just wanna spend some time with you

I don't wanna be in Cincy cause it smells like burning tires
I don't wanna be in Cleveland cause the lake'll catch on fire
I don't wanna be in Dayton not without a .22
I just wanna spend some time with you oh oh

Well it's so damn hard to find a reason
To stay in this infuriating place
But it's harder still to find a reason to leave oh oh

I don't wanna be in New York cause it's buried under crime
I don't wanna be in Portland where it's raining all the time
I don't wanna be in San Francisco in the early morning dew
I just wanna spend some time with you

I don't wanna be in London cause the skies are always grey
I don't wanna be in Paris cause I don't parles no francais
I don't wanna be in China with a horrifying flu
I just wanna spend some time with you oh oh

It's a rainy Sunday morning in Van Buren
The pious folks all scurry into church
We watch them trudge through the mud and sludge
I guess this place could be a whole lot worse

They say the grass is always greener
On the other side of the county line
But I'll just stay, brown grass is pretty anyway
Cause I just wanna spend some time with you
Spend some time with you

Our colony
Is shining through the shaking of the artificial moon
The light of noon

Cut ragged glass
Kaleidoscope of soapy film refract the rays that pass
The blades of grass

Recite the words that you were taught

The face of man
You stare into the center as the colors bleed away
The dryest rain

You feel the same
The dirt beneath your saddle boots is snapping as you step
Into the scene

This life is just a fatal dream

Don't you ever worry about those dizzy spells you feel
That's just the taming of the ghosts
They can't hurt you, they'll desert you now

Take up your arms
The final day is here, you feel the ringing in your ears
Now disappear

The flaming sky
The rally of a lost July, the night precedes the lullaby
And takes away the last supply of day

"
105057,"

Aching bones and creaky homes and dust clouds on the street
Leaves are pinned by restless winds and fear
Premonition intuition trouble's near
Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here

The grinding fades from combine blades the tractor's hungry heart
At three o'clock the blackbird flock is gone
And no one knows why Jenna Rose just disappeared
But Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here

Train smoke flies and alibis are sinking in the wind
The little toys from little boys are gone
Silence fills the flour mills and streets are clear
Honcho Graham from Birmingham was/is here

Now every year there's less of here as nature chews it down
A town bereft and all that's left is rust
But any gent who's smelled the scent of solemn fear
Knows Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here
Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here

The barometric pressure is increasing, but it's still below
The levels that we see in winter storms
We're up by thirteen millibars from where we were before
And it weakens as it moves in from the shore
(But Chad...)

Please, Carol, let me talk
Cuz I've got something to say, oh
Please, Carol, let me talk

Won't you let me do my job, I'm trying to explain
That once the pressure builds, the storm will fizzle out
I'm sorry if your feeble brain can't follow what I say
But I have dumbed it down as far as I will go

[Chorus]
It might not take a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
Or to tell you that it's sunny in Palm Springs
But that's not why I'm here, yeah, I went to school for years
So that I could tell you more about these things

[Chorus]

"
105059,"

I know you think she's sweet as candy
I know you wanna be with her
But Josie got a reputation
A scratch behind her purr

She's got her little game perfected
She'll let you think you have control
Then one day when you would least expect it
And steal away your soul

It's so easy when you think you're winning
But she's got herself another plan
You may think you're being clever like a modern man
But Josie has the upper hand

She's stubborn as a drunken donkey
She's subtle as a wrecking ball
She's spoiled like a bad banana
You're gonna slip and fall

She's denser than her diamond necklace
She's colder than a toilet seat
She's lazy as a dog on Sunday, but
You're the one who's on a leash

[Chorus]
I know you're not to blame
And there's no shame in falling for her siren
But while you're still a man
You better get out while you can

[Chorus x 2]

"
105060,"

I picked you up at ten to four
Just like a thousand times before
On a thousand other days

We took a walk in Silver Springs
I didn't even say a thing
Everything just disappeared

I was there the day the river went dry
And I just watched it flow away
I just stood and watched that river die
Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
You just hope for rain

You saw the dried-out river bed
You broke the silence and you said
Where did all that water go?

I didn't know, so I replied
It's just the nature of the tide
But you knew better

I was there the day the river went dry
And I just watched it flow away
I just stood and watched that river die
Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
You just hope for rain

I took you home, you said good night
I watched you fade into the light
Then you vanished through the door

My skin is dry as desert air
There's water, water everywhere
But I'm not thirsty

I was there the day the river went dry
And I just watched you flow away
I just stood and watched that river die
Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
You just hope for rain

And just hope for rain
And just hope for rain
And just hope for rain

I just grow up as you do
You'll never blow me down
I just burn out as you do
You better watch your tongue

How dare you say that I was born to die?
Standing on the road we are kings of time
We are kings of life

It's exactly what I need
We are all such products, honey
You say: I deserve it
I feel like a horse of a different color

Mother, mother, do we know each other?
I have nothing to say

Mother, mother, do we need each other?
I have nothing to say

I'll follow the stars when the sun goes to bed
Till everything I've ever known is long dead
I can't go back home 'cause I want to be free
Someone tell the others what's become of me

[Chorus]
Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, women in Cairo
Sure don’t dance, they don't dance alone

[Verse]
I should have never lent you my 45
I guess my lesson is not to lend
There’s a big needle going over the line
And for a time you have a friend
But stone cold silence in the room means the record is at its end
You’re turning it over so many times
It’s never going back into its sleeve again
There’s two sides to every story
But it seems like you’ve got ten
When I get no letters, it’s the Cairo blues you send

[Chorus]
Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, women in Cairo
Sure don’t dance, they don't dance alone

[Verse]
Now I know that every time you get lonesome
You go and fill yourself to the brink
Find yourself a man in a suit and tie
Who’ll introduce you to what he drinks
He’s answering your questions funny now
So you’ll wonder how he thinks
He sees his reflection in your skin
You’re gonna see yours in the hotel sinks
Staring back, the Cairo blues it never blinks

[Chorus]
Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, women in Cairo
Sure don’t dance, they don't dance alone

[Verse]
Now I'm looking at those thin winter trees
And they're looking like railings for the sky
I got my bare hands in my coat pockets
And it’s so cold that I could cry
When I see that forest falling, all I hear is firewood
And it's crackling louder than that record ever could
But it don’t drown out those Cairo blues for good

[Chorus]
Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, in Cairo
They don't dance alone

Old gas station hasn’t changed in decades
Cashier checks the time around her
Put my things on the counter
Pull out my wallet like some pull down the shades
My only brother lent me his only car
Who knew I would drive it so far
Sometimes you move out of some obligations
It was gorgeous on the outside, inside it was just a machine
It was the fastest thing I’ve ever seen
I first met Victoria at Victoria station
We’d always talked about going for a beer
She said, “It’s strange now that you’re here.”
We went back to her place, 57th we’d cross it
She’s as poor as me but she looks twice as good
I told her that because it’s something I would
She shrugged a little and she turned off the fauset
And later on as we were crawling into bed
I was thinking on something my father had said
He said, “You’re better off, off of the main drag.”
With my well-worn body wrenched like a rag
There I was, straight off the main drag

Well, the windows fogged up and the world it did freeze
With its restless passerby in the cold nighttime breeze
The violins dug in and one tear I cry
My ears were ringing when we stepped outside
Your sweat sweetly mixed with the sea salt air
Oh, I was glad when we decided to get out of there
And looking down the avenue
You said there’s only one cure for that ringing I hear

You were talking so close I could see and feel your breath
You smiled and told me that cure was death
You were always pretty clever, much more than you’d let on
Your kind of thinking was dead on
It takes two to tango, it took one to teach
You were in my arms but you were out of reach

And the windows fogged up and outside we did freeze
Amongst the restless passerby in the cold nighttime breeze

Evert now and again when I go out at night
I pass by some stranger who asks for a light
And her handwriting it don’t match up to yours
You said that all lamps are lit by one kind of fire
But in some kinds of light I just can’t call you a liar
And in the wine bottle bars and in the late night dawn
I often wonder which side of the glass you’re now on

Photographer friend, photographer friend
I’ll see you in the end
You ain’t like y other friends, you never judge
Picture’s worth a thousand words, it explains why we don’t talk
As we travel past the perfumed rows of hemlock trees
With one wheel in my hands and four more on the road
And you, you’re hanging out of the window
One days, we’ll be married to different people
And any stills you keep’ll keep us still until
You take the future and leave me with the past
Photographer friend, photographer friend
Some things they never last
You’ll see the future change the colour of the past
Photographer friend, Photographer friend
Some things they never last

All I want is brick house with a porch that wraps around
All I want is land enough for my children to run
In the highest pitch of grace, the end of trial and gratitude
It was for you that all others I did forsake
For you all others I would forsake

How could it have been so often that we did speak of purpose and of having

Dreamt his body with his back to the lake, certain depths I cannot place
Walk and talk fine through all of the days, still I miss the words you’d say
Past the point now of trusting it to change
I've just learned to live around it

Still, I will sleep too long or I will hardly sleep at all
So from where does energy come

Meet me by the fire door, of happiness I don’t ask more
She is who I cut root vegetables beside, with you still in my mind
It is with them that we spend our nights, laughter that tides through the rest
But I liked it best when the morning had not left
And wake was not yet in your eyes

High, high, high, low, low, low
I would have seen you through both

Sunshine Marmalade

"
106340,"

If you were a carpenter, your hands to the grain
If you’d stayed a stranger and I’d never learned your name
If you were a creature of make believe
If you were the shades of colors my eyes cannot see

I never would have known what you could have meant to me

If you were a mason, your body over stone
If you were a garden with myrtle overgrown
If you were the walls that purposed the room
If you were a prism with the light passing through

I never would have known what you could have meant to me

If you were a child, born new into the day
If you were the dreamcatcher above the bed I make
If you were immortal, with no concern for age
If you were the northern hills that knew not rapid pace

I never would have known what you could have meant to me

"
106341,"

Of all the needs
There are none
There are none which are imagined
Of all the fires that ever burned
It was all the that I did learn

Have you forgotten what we were like then?
When the day came fat with an apple in its mouth

It is no use to worry about time
We know the length that we have lived

All the pastures and the ice and water
And the high roads that I have come to know

I would not want to be faster or greener than now

You were, you were the best of
The best of all my days

"
106342,"

We met on New Years Eve in New York City
How cold it had been then and soon will be again
We could’ve lived together and given up our dreams of wandering
We could’ve left together and given up our dreams of the home we could keep

You may travel alone and still be accompanied by my love

We parted by my birthday and without you here I am a different age
How bright I had been then and fear it may not ever show again
So continue to live alone and speak not your thoughts of land or holiday and I will leave again and make all new plans to fill the space that you left

I do travel alone and yours is not a number I can call on the phone

"
106343,"

[Verse 1]
Paper that's quick to burn, and the cinnamon peeler
Beetles crushed that dye the carmine, well, I exist to be dreaming still
Kansas, Arkansas, my fields they're always rich and in fire
Long work labor not worth our minds
And I long forgotten the feeling of silence

[Chorus 1]
And if the roses need not tending
Until, until noon I'd sleep
Never could I have gone on that way
Because money's not the thing that's ever given me sight

[Verse 2]
Colorado, Wyoming, Helena into the Evergreen
And the wilds washed all thought of endeavor that was left in me

[Chorus 2]
And would you ask my permission
The next time you absorb me?
Preserve my memory of the mystic west
As I lay no claim to the devotion I felt

[Verse 3]
Our conversation, it banks in me
And I had almost forgotten the nature of dawn
I thought of it for days after, even months after the moments were gone

[Chorus 3]
But I'd get so lonely inside that room
No matter who would ever wait for me
I get so lonely inside that room
No matter who would ever wait for me

"
106344,"

You’ve been away
So long, so long
Now my hair is grey
And so long, so long
Your face continued to burn
Long after the lamp was dry
Sometimes there’d be a fog horn
Deep in the night I’d hear it cry
Johnny, Johnny
Standing above me
Hold me, Johnny
I’ve given my heart to you
See my face in the light
The lines recite the hopeless nights
But you look just the same
As the day we met, I’ll never forget
You fed me a fig from your hands
My master, the moon was high
Feeling the heavens expand
Deep in your arms I would sigh
Johnny, Johnny
Standing above me
Hold me, Johnny
I’ve given my heart to you
Raise me up, Johnny
Crush me, enfold me
Is that you Johnny
I’ve given my heart to you
I’ve given my heart to you
I’ve given my heart to you

"
106345,"

Like tying a knot
You stiffened to me
And when it got taut
You tore yourself free

Oh darlin', how could you dare
You won't be climbing my dark hair
From reservoirs of maiden stars
Lead us on
You will not find the forest floor
Where I lie

Oh darlin', it's not your kiss
Pressing me deep in the loaminess
As crimson leaves fall from the tress
As we roll
And shadows bow on the path
Where we stroll

I want to erase the contours we made
And tumbling from grace
How quickly we fade

Oh darlin', how could you dare
You won't be climbing my dark hair
As pounding waves
Flood through the maze
We adore
You will not walk by my side
Evermore
You will not press my
Midnight mouth
Evermore
You will not see yourself in me
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore

"
106346,"

I've lost you once again
But I can't lose heart
To watch this dream descend
Just tears me apart
You close your eyes
And you can't hear me
Fast asleep in your bed of misery
Baby get out of bed
Don't close your eyes my sleepy head
Don't close your eyes my sleepy head
Look at all the shooting stars
Billions of shooting stars
Streak the sky
Dazzling diamond light
You're lost to me
And you can't break free
Wrapped in the gloom of ancient history
Baby get out of bed
Don't close your eyes my sleepy head
Don't close your eyes my sleepy head
Look at all the shooting stars
Billions of shooting stars
Streak the sky
Dazzling diamond light
Watch the night
Gather shooting stars
Baby throw off that cloud
The bed of thorns that lay you down
Quick like silver out of bounds
Look at all the shooting stars
Some of them could be ours
Stream the sky
Dazzling diamond light
Wish I might
On shimmering shooting stars
Glimmering shooting stars
Dimming
Shooting stars

"
106347,"

Hard to believe you and me
We were once thick as thieves
Just a bunch of wiseacres
We were young, that's true
But we didn't care
Where the laughter could take us
But the light has dimmed
Behind your eyes
And I can no longer find you
Where you used to be
Who you used to be
And all that put-on wincing
Don't you know it ain't convincing
If you won't come down from the ceiling
If you won't come down from the ceiling
You're leaving me no choice
You're just a murmur inside the white noise
Now you prowl like a ghost
And you mince in the dens
With the toasts of the moment
Where indulgence is all
But to whom took a fall
And you dread the contagion
The sun's gone down
You take your throne
Amongst the sycophants and fakers
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Time to take the piss
Your love is hit or miss
To hold my place in your top favorites
Always on my best behavior
If you won't come down from the ceiling
If you won't come down from the ceiling
You're leaving me no choice
You're just a murmur inside the white void
Inside, inside, inside the white noise
Too high, too high, inside the white noise
If you won't come down from the ceiling

"
106348,"

Behind the church of the holy family
I'll wait for you
Quarter to midnight
Under the lid of heavy cloud
Without a sound
Undress in the moonlight
Can't you see, I want this one
Come to me, I want this one
Fog hanging low around the spire
The stones and moss
Mum in the churchyard
And with this mouth I consecrate
Your marble form
Striped with a headlight
Can't you see, I want this one
Come to me, I want this one
Don't you dare look away
Face me
Even though you're afraid
Embrace me
Capture this radiant stone
Blindly cede control
I'm waiting
For the bell to toll wildly
Can't you see, I want this one
Come to me, I want this one
This one, this one
I want this one

"
106349,"

And the angels shall spread their wings to fly
Away
And by the sunset He shall grovel
Grovel before the black kind of Yours
And quake when the infernal splendour
Shall breathe out by the moonbeam
Bow before th' eternal helot
From now you shall endure endlessly
Lust, whilst the Night obtains a shadow
's been sent to old forts
And between nine deaths and three moons
I shall deny that I ever saw the lands of
Red and serenity
And I tried to be alone, at my last forever dawn
When the sacrifice will be, oh I'll be bleeding
Before thee
And I tried tobe alone, the solitude I own
Your name I shall divine, heaven is thine
When the sun won't rise again
The quietism of my heart's done
When the sun returns to me
I'll fall into despondency
And I tried to be alone, at my last forever dawn
When the sacrifice will be, oh I'll be bleeding
Before thee
And I tried to be alone, the solitude I own
Your name I shall divine, heaven is thine
Fire, comes from a northern sea
Thanatos fills my eyes
Ashes Thy black of wrath
A stone broke the sky

"
106350,"

They say change is good, change is good
Bleaching the cracks of the neighborhood
Tiny stages crumble, just to feed the trough
No one's making trouble, sSo where is the trade-off
I'm waving the smelling salts
This is your wake up call
Won't you come to mack
Won't you come to
Shadows climb up the wall as they're born
Competing for a flattering form
Who's superior, eerier, eerier
Who's superior, eerier, eerier
The numbers climb with the crane
And every space filled to the brim
When every view becomes the same
A window out or a window in
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Can't tear down their scenery
Blocking everything I believe in
Make your getaway while you still can
Do not be afraid of distant lands
Make your getaway while you still can
You know glass turns back to sand
There is no edge, no frontier
That has not been dredged, we're our worst fear
Plane-safe your phones, beware the drones
As they send in the clones, send in the clones
Mute their sound, cackling and cacking
Pound for pound, fracturing and fracking
I see, I see, see an empire
With no fireflies
No honeybees
No spring-fed wells
No maple trees
No icebergs
No eagles
Just beetles
Can't tear down their scenery
Blocking everything I believe in
Make your getaway while you still can
Do not be afraid of distant lands
Make your getaway while you still can
You know glass turns back to sand
Here's an oar, here's a boat
Sail away through this moat
Under, underground
Under

View so clear, vision fiber-optic
At the crucible, just before my prime hits
Too smooth, and I'm not even trying yet
Walk the line, no cash, just appear rich
Voice boom like the crack from a thunder stick
Play it tough 'cause I'm just too fuckin' sensitive
Think I'm open, it's likely 'cause I smoked a spliff
No fun, but the silence feels like innocence
I see myself so clearly
Keep it moving, keep it going strong
Try to stand clear, but it move too fast
In the mood, but you know it won't last
She'll walk away with your heart and your cash
So sexy, but not enough class
Sounds stupid, but I put myself on blast
I was in the crib, she was grazing in the grass
Seems like the world was really just a flash
Keep it in perspective as I raise another glass
I see myself so clearly
Keep it moving, keep it going strong
Push it high speed, push to the cusp
Pop a few of these, make your head rush
I'm at capacity, waiting to erupt
Break free, will it ever be enough
I know the feel up and down just from a touch
So good, but I don't want to get stuck
Crushed paper, who can I trust
All world, rise from the dust
I see myself so clearly
Keep it moving, keep it going strong

To save us you pour down rains of love
From an ocean of auspicious qualities
Praise to our masters’ divine lotus feet!

Maddened within by the moods you are tasting
Hairs standing on end, shivering and crying
Praise to our masters’ divine lotus feet!

She loves travel
Her heart flows... where she chose
With a routine
Quickly pack the bags, and let's go
In and out of hotels
Travel light and propel
From one spot to next spot
She did so well....
Never really got attached to any one place
...More about the quantity
Addicted to the pace
Til one day...
An unexpected stay....
In a place she kept secret
So I'd rather not say
Just know..
A feeling resonated in her chest so..
Strong that she didn't feel like she could move on
But still, the plane ticket had a time on it
She was used to only doing what her mind wanted
Though her spirit started to speak
She wouldn't let it peak
To the point where it would shuffle her agenda for the week
But sitting on the plane to leave simply felt wrong
Looking out the window with her face forlorn....
Long long long long long... long long way to go...
Liftoff
Takeoff
Always on schedule
Disregard silly words your gut keeps telling you
Inner dialogue
As she rides through the fog
Up and through the clouds
Then descent
Touch down
Now on the ground
Speeding to a meeting
To tell you all the truth
She's aloof in the proceedings
Couldn't shake this feeling that she didn't belong
Now the music getting louder
Heart singing that song
Longing...
For this place she barely knew
Life offers so many paths
For you to choose
Sometimes though, we're not meant to know
But she listened to her inner voice
It's telling her ""go""
She rose from the table
Thanked the whole staff
Chuckled under her breath to stop a full laugh
Thank you all for coming out, but I've gotta go
Please direct all your requests to so & so
Same bags, same tags, same short
Notice
She left to embark on a quest with
One focus
To unearth...
This possible rebirth
The fulfillment of understanding her purpose on earth
No time to waste
She's hopping on a flight
The only way to make her and her fate unite
She's living through passion
Life on a whim
Ascending through the night
Now the journey begins
Taken to the edge, don't hold back, just jump ahead
Choosing her name, naming herself, whether she knows or not gotta go every moment
Long long way to go, got a long long way to go
Choosing her name, naming herself, whether she knows or not gotta go every moment
Finally she lands in this brand new land
Luggage in tow
With her heart in her hand
She walk upon foreign soil once again
But this time with every intent of staying
Made calls to family
Called some friends
They didn't understand
No, they couldn't comprehend
A couple people even told her that she's crazy
Thinking to herself on the low, ""Well maybe...""
Nevertheless, the quest must go on
Doubts in her mind, she refused to prolong
Never known to be thin skinned
She looked within
And let her exploration begin
Discovery of many semi unturned stones
From times she had visions of life with lush tones
Envisioned herself before the pressures of the world
Had a convo with that little bright eyed girl
Those old ambitions
Were so enriching
They gave a new purpose to life
A new rhythm
She walked with a bop
As she went to see spots
That moved her with pure beauty
She channelled more thoughts
Her heart flourished
And art nourished her soul
Her creations shed a light upon the people she showed
The love radiated
Satiating the community
Causing this to circulate a bliss quite beautifully
Suitably spawned
By feelings of calm
That were anchored by an overwhelming sense she belonged
All along she thought she simply had a flair
For venturing around the globe until she came here
Now she realizes that the furious pace
Was her spirit seeking a feeling
An energy
A place
A hundred thousand miles just to reach one zone
Her luggage is unpacked
She's finally at home
Oh... long long way to go...
Taken to the edge, don't hold back, just jump ahead
Choosing her name, naming herself, whether she knows or not gotta go every moment...

Cry your tears, not a crocodile's
Let the wanderers roll on by
They'll get to nowhere
After many miles
You'll dance to death but never die

Don't need a ticket, if you never want to take a ride
Get inside, its gonna rain
Don't need a reason
It's just do or die
Hope inside, get on the train

A wise man says""Well, I don't care.""
A fool says ""Yes you do.""
The emperor's got nothing to wear
The pauper's got a hole in his shoe

Don't need a ticket, if you never want to take a ride
Get inside, its gonna rain
Don't need a reason
It's just do or die
Hope inside, get on the train

The pretty girl's got nothing to say
The ugly one will sing you the blues
You saved your pennies for a rainy day
And you gave yourself another thing to lose!

That swimming shark's your drug
That hamster wheel your lover
You keep it up to keep form falling down
But what goes ain't always heaven bound

Don't need a ticket, if you never want to take a ride

Where have you been you sweet little girl
Did you find your place in the sun
Always in your dreams, you're never really there
Did you find the thing that you lost

She never seems to wake up
But I don't want to give up
She locked the door and lost the key
When she goes to Dreamland
Nothing bad can happen
Cause she won't be seen there
No she won't be seen there
No she won't be seen
Cause there's no one there

Where have you been you green little bird
Did you fly away to see the world
You're living in a dream
You're chasing the ghost
Did you find the key that you lost

She never seems to wake up
But I don't want to give up
She locked the door and lost the key
When she goes to Dreamland
Nothing bad can happen

I'm just like you

Take my hand now
I'm not sure I can deal with it
Take my hand now

Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name
They just break us day by day
Into million of small pieces of rainbow
When do,you think it will rain?
I really wish it could rain now
Take my hand and see
We're still part of the rainbow

Well you hate yourself when you feel so weak
You hurt yourself and then you bleed
Well I know that you could change it all
If you really would

Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name
They just break us day by day
Into million of small pieces of rainbow
When do,you think it will rain?
I really wish it could rain now
Take my hand and see
We're still part of the rainbow

Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name
Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name

When people get strange I just run
You should know it, you should know
When people get strange all around
You should know it, you should know
When people get strange I just hide
You should know it, you should know
You should know it, you should know

I will catch you anyway

Nobody buys you flowers

If you will like my flowers

You are so sweet and I'm so alone
Oh darling please
Tell me you're the one

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you’re thinking, what you’re thinking about
Tell me when you’re finished, maybe I’ll come around
Had enough to bring me all the way to the ground
I don’t have to tell you what I’m thinking about

[Verse 2]
You have made your bed, I know better than to sleep in it
Better off dead than the hell that will become of it
You have hurt my head but I’m not denying that
I did not bring it on myself

[Verse 3]
I take pieces of myself from everyone around me
I’m not individual enough for you
I replicate the people I admire
But at least I’m not bitter and sad

[Outro]
I may not be 100% happy but at least I’m not with...
I may not be 100% happy but at least I’m not with you
I may not be 100% happy but at least I’m not with...
I may not be 100% happy but at least I’m not with...
I may not be 100% happy but at least I’m not with...

I don’t really like any of your friends
But it’s not that hard for me to pretend

Hard to pretend
Hard to pretend
Hard to pretend

Come on, Davey, let’s go plant a tree
You bring the spade; I’ll bring the seeds

[Verse 1]
I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets
But luckily, I left the heater on
And in my dreams, I wrote the best song that I’ve ever written
Can’t remember how it goes
I stayed drunk and fell awake; I was cycling on a plane
And far away I heard you say you liked me
We drifted to a party, cool; the people went to arty school
They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

[Chorus]
In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name

[Verse 2]
I found an Ezra Pound and made a bet
That if I found a cigarette, I’d drop it all and marry you
Just then a song comes on: ""You can’t always get what you want""
The Rolling Stones, oh, woe is we, the irony
The stones became the moss and once all inhibition's lost
The hipsters made a mission to the farm
We drove by tractor there; the yellow straw replaced our hair
We laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth

[Chorus]
In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name

[Verse 3]
You said, ""We only live once,"" so we touched a little tongue
And instantly, I wanted to
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping
As the doors were slowly closing on the world
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours
And still, the inspector inspected me
The lady in the roof was living proof
That nothing really ever is exactly as it seems

[Chorus]
In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name

[Verse 4]
We caught the riverboat downstream
And ended up beside a team of angry footballers
I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will
Into the welcome doors of the casino
We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet señoritas
And we all went home as winners of a kind
You said, ""I guarantee we'll have more fun
Drink 'til the moon becomes the sun
And in the taxi home, I’ll sing you a Triffids song""

[Chorus]
In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name

"
106855,"

[Verse 1]
In my wallet is a photo of you
The day we split, I ripped it in two
Stuck it back together with glue
Tear my posters down from the wall
Don’t wanna worship no dead heroes
Everything I owned, I sold

[Chorus]
I got lost somewhere between here and there
I’m not sure what the town was called

[Verse 2]
In my pocket is a bottle of blue
Drink it when I’m feeling misconstrued
Don’t like the taste but I like the overview
I made a lot of money in my days
Spent it all on the current craze
I don’t see no need to save

[Chorus]
I got lost somewhere between here and there
I’m not sure what the town was called

I got lost somewhere between here and there
I'm not sure what the town was called

I hardly think about you anymore
Except when I see the water and the sand on the ocean floor
All the years that I've held you close
You should've been anyone else, I know
All the years that I've held you close
You should've been anyone else, I know

Sometimes the night brings me back to you
And I look at the time spent wasted on you
What a lie you were living then
You could've been somebody's better side
What a lie you were living then
You could've been somebody's better side

He sent a letter and it reached me
Some things never change
Be it a river or be it your name

To see it, the world had been kind and sweet
And it really seems that the shadows
Have stopped following your every beat
Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me

You're still missing from my dreams

Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

I was coming apart those days
I don't give a damn about the way
Colors on the trees change from red to green
It's a dead city Emily
Oh I was a-blaze, still I had to stay
With that bad Emily

Oh I saw the light today
Opened up the door
Any other man would've run run away
Em was stuck inside the moor
Any other man would've run run away
Emily is something more

I was coming apart those days
I don't give a damn about the way
Birds fly in the breeze, things you say to me
It's a dead city Emily
I cannot recall loving this at all
It's a dead city in between

Oh I saw the light today
Opened up the door
Any other man would've run run away
Em was stuck inside the war
Oh it looks so bright today
Opened up the door
Any other man would've run run away
Emily is something more
Any other man would've run run away
From the house and to the shore

Dead city Emily
Dead city Emily
Dead city Emily
Dead city Emily

[Chorus]
Firecrackers
Burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers
It's me, it's me, it's me you're looking for

[Verse 1]
July Fourth of last year, we spilled all the blood
How'd you spend your summer days?
I know better now I don't call you up at night
Cause, baby, your ghost and I have changed

[Verse 2]
I saw your face everywhere I looked, you sat across from me
Baby, I'm a ghost when you're away
I told you all about my days, you told me where you lived
And we have drunk all our summers away
We have drunk our summers away

[Chorus]
Firecrackers
Burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers
It's me, it's me, it's me you're looking for

[Verse 3]
Saturday, maybe you'll come down to see me
We'll walk around
I know better now I don't get as high
That I can't see the leaves turn from green to brown

[Chorus]
Firecrackers
Burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers
It's me, it's me, it's me you're looking for

[Chorus]
Firecrackers
Burned into heaven on the floor
My attackers
It's me, it's me, it's me you're looking for

She’s only laughing every night
She’s only haunted by a sea horse
She’s only troubled by the minnows and shills in cracks yet filled

She don’t know what to do with her passion
She don’t know what to do with her passion

She’s only laughing every night
Check out the weasel in the tree top
Spoke tales of vanishing, a crown, double galaxy, Major Phil

She don’t want - know what Joan of Arc felt
Sea foam baby, sings to the Catskills

In a sense we don’t see her
When I gotta go there’s always room for none
In a safe unmarked theatre
Tickets up for sale there’s always shows for none

She’s only laughing every night
Check out the halogen in Amherst
A tidal wave of coming films, sketches scribbled on a napkin spill

She don’t know what to do with her passion
She don’t know what to do with her passion
She don’t know what to do with her passion
She don’t know what to do with her passion

Rock steady in your Morrissey tan
Stunned white faces buried in the sand

Gimme no soul no fascination
Gimme no bread no fascination
Gimme no eyes no fascination
Hear the syncopated marching, drum-machines
26,000 open apple C
No conviction, heads in atrophy
Silver spoon eyes and their faces clean
Gimme no love no fascination
Gimme no heart no fascination
Gimme no soul no fascination
Gimme no eyes no fascination

Gimme no love no fascination

The stories you've been writing are what you'd expect
Other people want to hear, isn't that right?
Where is that song I know that you can sing?
Paralyzed by what hasn't happened yet
Love is gonna set you free

A lion yes he needs a mane but a bird needs a nest
I want to hear that song so just give up enough

White lies and tight lips are a kiss of loneliness
Hold fast, hold tightly but give your love
Love is gonna set you free

A lion yes he needs a mane but a bird needs a nest
I want to hear that song so just give up enough

I can't say that I've given up enough
From my shaky hands like tree trunks
If you stay long I swear I'll give it up
I keep a white lie like a steam punk

A heart needs all your blood
But a heart needs some give

A lion yes he needs a mane but a bird needs a nest
I want to hear that song so just give up enough
A lion, oh a lion, oh oh oh oh

Y'a comme kekchose avec le combo pine thon
Pour get my mind on
Some extra complicated time zone
Comme where i'm from
Peux pas design clones de moi

Ça serait extra good
Pas d'Glenn dans mon rhyme tone

Pas besoin de knocker underwood
Vous avez des problèmes de poud'

Mais les drogues fortes

Elle t'ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
J'te trompe avec toi-même
C'est sûr qu'on s'fra pas caught

Un plan sans faute
J'en aime une autre
Elle t'ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
J'te trompe avec toi-même
C'est sûr qu'on s'fra pas caught

[Verse 1: Maybe Watson]
California state sunset car plate
Couché sur le sable all day sadé
Messemble j'ai le feeling
De t'avoir déjà rencontrée
Doux parlé to you dans la langue de bobbé
Le couché du soleil peut pas durer all day
Faut retourner au mansion nourrir le poney
Viens amène ton petit il pourrait le monter
As-tu quelque chose à me montrer, moi ouais
T'es extra hot pan am Karine Vanasse
Te peep c'est comme du espionnage
La ligne est mince respecte ton personnage
Un different kind of role
Quand on roll, that's the way to go
C'est comme la deuxième première fois
Qu'on fait l'amour
J'ai mis ma bague dans la poche
En tout cas
On fait pas juste regarder le menu
On order up
Après là for now
J'ai l'goût d'relaxer dans le bain
Viens m'rejoindre
Pis on va toute ranger demain

[Chorus: Maybe Watson]
Un plan sans faute
J'en aime une autre
Elle t'ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
J'te trompe avec toi-même
C'est sûr qu'on s'fra pas caught

Un plan sans faute
J'en aime une autre
Elle t'ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
J'te trompe avec toi-même
C'est sûr qu'on s'fra pas caught

[Bridge: Claude Bégin]
Avant qu'on aille plus loin
Y faut tracer les limites
Y faut pas rester dans notre coin
Y faut qu'après ça on soit kit

Tu me gardes
J'te regarde
On se re-re-re-re-re-re-garde

Tu me gardes
J'te regarde
On se re-re-re-re-re-re-garde

L'inconnue dans tes yeux me charment
Tous nos repères nous échappent
L'inconnu dans mes yeux te charment
Tomber dans les pulsions illégales

[Chorus: Claude Bégin]
Un plan sans faute
J'en aime une autre
Elle t'ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
J'te trompe avec toi-même
C'est sûr qu'on s'fra pas caught

Un plan sans faute
J'en aime une autre
Elle t'ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
J'te trompe avec toi-même
C'est sûr qu'on s'fra pas caught

[Verse 1: Maybe Watson]
Ça fait comme 800 fois qu'on a dû le dire
Pas de viandes froides et des fruits séchés
Plein d'shits pas bon pour la santé
Toutes sortes de chips que personne a demandé, naw
Moi j'veux des amandes rôties
Une machine pour se faire un smoothie
De la beer pour mes peers, pis du cool cheese
Une petite dernière avant de jet
Y faut que j'représente
Une pinte de lait entier Liberté 3.8 pourcent

[Chorus: KenLo]
Bienvenue dans l'backstage
Avant l'show
Toute autour d'l'arbre à bébains
Une coupe de bourgeons laissés
À l'abandon dans une pièce même pas d'fenêtre
Les épices sont pas cachées
Ni les bonnes variétés d'produits laitiers
Ça fait qu'j't'attends dans l'backstage

[Verse 2: Maybe Watson]
C'est dans ce drôle d'endroit
Qu'on a fait connaissance
Tu veux un peu de quiche
Moi je l'aime pas vraiment
Tu t'rappelles nos premiers mots
Le traiteur était dégueulasse
J't'ai offert un drink
Dans le sink, y'avait d'la glace
T'étais dans le film boogie nights
Pussy tight
Boobies minces
Pis t'étais pas trop le groopie type
J'dois ôter toutes les couches
Pour explorer ton corps pis toute
Débouche une bière avant j'te touche
Pis qu'on forme un couple

[Chorus: KenLo]
Viens m'voir dans l'backstage
Avant l'show
Toute autour d'l'arbre à bébains
Une coupe de bourgeons laissés
À l'abandon dans une pièce même pas d'fenêtre
Les épices sont pas cachées
Ni les bonnes variétés d'produits laitiers
Ça fait qu'j't'attends dans l'backstage

[Outro: KenLo]
Ton nom c'pas sûr j'va m'en rappeler
Après un bébain, 2 bébains, 3 bébains
Les roches ont pas mal roulé
Sur l'pavé depuis secondaire 5
La, la, la - la, la, la
4 bébains, 5 bébains, 6 bébains
J't'attends dans l'backstage

Tu nous apprécies
Moi je t'apprécie

Tous les deux dans la télé

Nos vêtements inutiles
Nature et désir
Voir clair dans ton jeu
Tes super pouvoirs

Réussit à me voir

I've been goin in my own roundabout way
Showing you that I'll love you always
Knowing that I'm gonna need you someday
But I gotta be the one to say when
I know that all the patience in you is used loving me

[Bridge:]
I've been riding on this train; it's too fast
But I've got somewhere to be and it won't last
Sorry, love, there is no room in vision
Sorry, love, I wanna be the one left
I know that all the patience in you is used loving me

[Chorus:]
Cause I fear, I fear that I won't be the one they love
I fear, I fear that I won't do the things I want
I fear, I fear a life of fear, I know it's tough
Take my worries and bring them to the sea
Wash them with me
Ease my mind with me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Oh, take me worries
Bring them to the sea
And wash them with me
Ease my mind with me
Ease my mind with me
Ease my mind
Ease my mind with me
Oh, ease my mind

If anybody wants to find me
I'll be in the last place you would look
In a place where people used to be
A land that's called reality
You'll find me there

I won't be catching up on Reddit
I won't be watching any news
I'll let the planet spin without me
'Cuz everything has been without me sometime
And everyone will be alright, if I'm not live by satellite

[Chorus: Josh Woodward]
It's a beautiful day, I'm running away
Don't bother to Facebook message or call me
'Cuz I'm living life in airplane mode
And everything is ok, I just wanna play
Unplug for a day, and live in the moment
'Cuz I'm living life in  airplane mode

[Verse 2: Josh Woodward]
I'm always drowning in the static
I'd rather swim in crystal seas
My battery's been running low
I need to take it nice and slow for just awhile

You won't be hearing bout my weather
And you won't see my breakfast pics
For videos of kitty cats
All gussied up in pretty hats, you'll have to wait
I hope it's not a tragedy, I hope you don't get mad at me

[Chorus: Josh Woodward]
It's a beautiful day, I'm running away
Don't bother to Facebook message or call me
'Cuz I'm living life in airplane mode
And everything is ok, I just wanna play
Unplug for a day, and live in the moment
Cuz I'm living life in  airplane mode

[Bridge: Josh Woodward]
Everything is now, everyone is everywhere
But no one seems to get up from their chairs
I'll come and sit with you, let's talk and have a drink or two
We'll open up the window for some air

And hear the voices down the street
Of children playing on the beach

It's... a... beautiful day
Don't... take... it away
I... just... want to play...
'Cuz I'm living life in airplane mode, yeah

[Chorus: Josh Woodward]
It's a beautiful day, I'm running away
Don't bother to Facebook message or call me

[Verse 1]
We could walk together
In the jade and the coolness of the evening light
And watch the crowds serenely flow
Through carnivals and shop windows where elm trees sigh

[Verse 2]
The summer's heat is fading
And the clown on the golden lawn holds out his hand
And out there in the fading night
The members of a strange parade play sarabandes

[Verse 3]
Like a silver ring thrown into the flood of my heart
With the moon high above the motorway
I have searched for all your fragrance in the silent dark
Is that okay?

[Verse 4]
So why don't we stick together?
With our eyes so full of evening and amphetamine
And watch the fools go rolling on
Through still fields as the darkness falls on England green

"
107552,"

A darker garden this, though pale with beauty
In the louring of the rain
How I long to break the silence
Where the moths and tigers play

Driving through the forest in the empty afternoon
A Japanese car stalled inside a glade
But the world is porcelain
Yes, the world is porcelain

And the quiet nights with the friend who could not stay
Left the future all sundazed

Alice, Jude and Laura singing
All our friends have come to stay
They are laughing in the sunlight
Where the criss-cross fountains play

Sunlight on the empty house and sunlight on the fields
The cul-de-sac, the law, the tracks, the lane
But the world is porcelain
Yes, the world is porcelain

Still the evening will not come here
And the stones are cracked and warm
And the pool is filled with sunlight
Still the evening will not come

On a night like this, you can't brush away
All the faces in the street
I've got so much longing in my heart
I can't even sleep

[Chorus 1]
Darling, there's a thick fog up ahead
The first time that I saw you, I couldn't say a thing
I walked in now, I walked in now, I walked in this room
I walked in with nothing

[Chorus 2]
'Cause spending time and money doesn't mean a thing
When the moon comes smiling through the trees
When the night has come like music to surround you
But you're missing

[Verse 2]
I picked her up at half past four
And felt the evening coming in her tired eyes
And everyone was leaving
And the moment soon passed away

[Chorus 1]
Darling, there's a thick fog up ahead
The first time that I saw you, I couldn't say a thing
I walked in now, I walked in now, I walked in this room
I walked in with nothing

[Chorus 2]
'Cause spending time and money doesn't mean a thing
When the moon comes smiling through the trees
When the night has come like music to surround you
But you're missing

"
107555,"

Though I know you'll never read the words I'm writing now
Shopping lists, ephemera beneath the Kingston stars
Evening rain is drifting in through spaces in the dark
And I dream of angels in the plumes of cigarettes
A single feather floating high above the silent Thames
Bright electric trains on Friday
Evening rain again

Me and Mr. Jones
So, so speechless and alone
Shopping lists, ephemera beneath the silent Kingston stars you know

Drifting though the Sunday mall until I'm blind
And tonight tonight tonight the time is mine
To purge the sweetness from my heart
And turn my eyes back to the darkness speechlessly
Wherever it is I should be

(chorus)
It's a suburb in the rain
It don't matter anyway
I get into work with the night still in my mind
On bright electric trains I'm blind

Drifting though the Sunday mall
And burning in the night
I wish I was driving south forever
From the light upon the asphalt and the rain
But into Sunday's dreams I fall again
Standing in my kitchen
I am turning with a fever in my heart
Above the drifting summer and the dark

"
107556,"

[Verse 1]
Bicycles have drifted through these leaves still wet
With rain
August now has faded in the silence of the rain
I remember one Sunday, riding in through the gate
Three balloons in a white sky, 1978
La la la…..

[Verse 2]
Playgrounds where we spent our days
Return within our dreams
What it is, it isn’t up to me
I’ve been driving in my car
On Sunday in the rain
And my life is slipping so away

"
107557,"

[Intro]
There’s a place that we can go
At the end of a long slow day
Streetlamps fuse the rising night
I feel so far away

[Verse 1]
When you came back late, from the garden
I couldn’t turn my eyes
And I was dead

[Verse 2]
Outside in the crowded pines
Ships are sailing though the wood
Impossible

[Verse 3]
Leaving in the space between
The Hovis homes, the railway heath
Impossible

[Verse 4]
I can see my freedom but I need a little time
Your hair wet and your arms full
You were dead, you were alive

[Verse 5]
Looking in the heart of light
Looking into the silence
From those nights so frigid

[Verse 6]
They seemed hardly real
Through the last light on the plain
Roland to the dark tower came

[Outro]

[Intro]
It's dark and it's a long way down
She said as she lay her head on the pillow
I took one step back
And I retired to evening

[Verse 1]
And the movie made me feel as if I wasn't here at all
And I drove home and I wound up all the windows in my car
In the lamplight I breathe
But the dark is falling in the garden over everything

[Verse 2]
John, I'm waiting for a morning filled with sunlight
When we can both drive away
Shake the dust right off my shoes
With younger friends and skies of blue like yesterday

[Verse 3]
John, I'm waiting for a morning filled with sunlight
When we can both drive away
Laughing friends and silent rides
And all the lovers that we lost are found again

[Verse 4]
I've been out walking in the verges and the quiet
Through all the traffic and the movement of the night
And the lamplight froze
Stopping so suddenly, hearing the dim radio

[Verse 1]
Gotta love me a little patience
Makes you feel so insecure
Take it all back if I could now
If it would help
I'd take back all of my time
Maybe I'd be a Baker
Or a waiter
I'm sure that can all be arranged
But my persistence through this resistance
Watch me blow it all away

[Chorus 1]
Oh my lord I cannot believe that I'm back here again
Scared of what the world has been imagining
It's not my friend
The indifference blows me away

[Verse 2]
Gotta fear me some inconsistence
They'll build you up
Then let you down
Take it all back to the beginning
When it was me
And you
And everything

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Oh, sorry)
Oh my lord, I cannot believe in x4

[Chorus 2]
Oh my lord I cannot believe that I'm right here again
Scared of what the world has been imagining

The indifference blows me away

[Verse 1]
She said ""How could you joke at a time like this?
I know why, cause this is what you wanted all along now, isn't it?
I think that all you ever really ever wanted
Was a reason to complain
That never stopped you before, don't let it get in your way""

Those are her words, not mine
As far as I'm concerned, we could've had a good time
So, if you walk out that door in disgust
I guess there's nothing more to discuss

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye

Don't listen to my music, don't lie in my bed
Don't listen to the references
To things that you might have actually said

Cause those are my words, not yours
As far as I'm concerned, it could have been a lot worse
I wasn't trying to avoid the confrontation
She isn’t crying, she’s just making conversation

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye

You can dance, you can move
You can slide, you can groove
If you want to

Rootless, use this form that
You just borrow for a while

You can get your face wet
There’s no law against it yet
If you want to
You can spend all your time
In a bottle of wine
If you want to

But you get lost in a screen
Til your insides turn green
And the buds in you sprout
Til the woods seem to shout out your name
It’s in vain, cos you’ve locked up your brain
It’s a shame

Where’s your smile?
Gimme that smile

"
107854,"

My confidence is at an all time low
I can’t seem to find my get up and go
While my confidence is oh so low

A laneway of trees
The late summer breeze
No sense of unease in me
You see, my strap muscles grew
Turned into a noose
Pull and it’s easy for you to be
Without worry

Misshapen and atrophied positive point of view
It’s been an interesting trip to say the least
Now these lovely people I’ve met have appetites to whet
When you’re finished trying to be the ghost at the feast

My confidence was at an all time low
Never a truer word spoken, you had to go I wish
I could say ‘nice to know you’

"
107855,"

I took a walk down the other side
To see what I could see
The flowers and trees all started to hide
There’s nothing here for me
The squirrels chatter like machine gun fire
And the moisture on my eyeballs started to freeze
Beneath the stones, the dead rattle their bones
But there’s nothing here for me

So take a little break from your big mistakes
And live a life, for once, all of your own

Now I turn into a massive lung
And drink up the day
The trees all leap from the soil
And they leave a colossal empty space
Where seasons blend Reason ends
Every corner, a friend
What kind of message is the world sending?
With robins on branches
Conspirators’ glances
Hypnotic red trances
And you
I nearly missed you

Yeah take a little break from your bellyache
And live a life, for once, all of your own

"
107856,"

It doesn’t matter where you go
Doesn’t matter what you see in me
Doesn’t matter what you say
It’s a grey day to me
The walls laugh at omens past
That silly bastard misery
Is out of tricks but for his last
Throws a grey day at me

The mood slides, you stay inside
Your mind churns as day turns to night
And a city of pages lures you in
Well-thumbed amber places welcome you with a grin
You know it’s been ages since you’ve had a drink
Meander and come upon your dusty friends
We’ll meet again with hollow souls
The couch swallows you whole

Regurgitated and new
A spectral assembly dance all around you
A surge of red, green and blue
The spectrum resembles the somersault world you knew
When you rubbed your eyes as a child
Son of all things wild
You won’t grow today, so there’s just no way
You’ll know a grey day

Say say say with your voice through the air
I'll dip my hands in acetate with warn grenades and hurricanes
Excited to bring life to this poor attempt at sinking in
Elated with such excellence I choose my battle wise again
Forgotten to the tides of May and swallowed by ten-thousand pages
Read for comforting ideas
Instruction manual forbiddance

But please forgive my monstrous fears
Forgive my thoughts and deafened ears
And please give me a second chance
I'll change this time
I'll change this time

Carefully conditioning our feet to touch the ground
Before we choke from tourniquets around your neck and frown
I know it's better, yeah, that I'm not there to teach you all the warning signs
But withing your gold tooth grin there are new promises
For better yet in brand new tire marks
I learn directions and trite remarks
This house has burned to ashes from the inside we have found
With raindrops drying faster than blood will ever seem to clot
I see the icicles they form around your teeth at night

But please forgive my monstrous fears
Forgive my thoughts and deafened ears
Please give me a second chance
I'll change this time
I'll change this time

From day to day I think of mountains
Nodding vigorously to pass the time
With kisses upon our eyes for comfort
Our childrens self will grieve inside

But please forgive my monstrous fears
Forgive my thoughts and deafened ears
Please give me a second chance
I'll change this time
I'll change this time

And I have stuttered way too much
While trying to pronounce this clamored row
In thoughts it’s better off this way
In thoughts of high where scaffolds grow
Like dandelion daisies, take my photograph
In turn from the first day of this month
And church bells ring for you and I
With melodies I tried to extricate
In thoughts, it’s better off this way

Car lights flickering past the midnight tinkering
I close the closet door, hoping you might hear my call
From time to time, you waited I’ll wait for you forever if you try
To tell me what went wrong
And now there’s certain things I care about
I know i ask so much of certain sparks
But you know, you light the room incisively, without a doubt
Just hold my body tightly through the night
And tell me what forever means to you

108078,"

En mis intentos por interpretar el motivo del naufragio he visto florecer esta pasión adolescente, brotar bosques boreales que se enraízan en mi pecho, en mis abismos más profundos, como cepas de un recuerdo que se niega a marcharse

Me he asomado al magma
He visto allí nuestro cuerpos amantes abrasados, inmolados en una muerte violenta y desgarrada, en un fuego que antes fue eterno
Y hundí allí mis manos en roja tortura, en la marea incandescente
Ojos inquietos que buscan y no encuentran

Pero hay algo primitivo que palpita corrigiendo esta tendencia antinatural
Un instinto reprimido, algo casi metafísico
Se propaga por mis venas, contamina mis arterias y rezuma por mis poros
Y cada glóbulo se resiente
Cada parte de mi cuerpo te reclama moribunda para que sanes la herida

Automutilación, alas muertas que me lastran, inercia que me arrastra
El amargo placer de hilar los días que me quedan buscando una droga que me salve
Pero no hay nada, solo flores palpitando al rojo vivo y labios marchitos
No hay dolor, no hay tortura, no hay nada

NO HAY DOLOR

"
108079,"

He vuelto a sentir el fuego tras la tormenta, caminando sin vida sobre el cemento, descifrando con dedos gélidos nuestras cicatrices
Bajo el cielo de invierno vuelvo a ti, víctima del carácter regresivo de nuestro amor
El eterno retorno: pura lisergia que nos arrastra

Somos hijos de la tragedia, de un mundo que no pudo asimilarnos
El aborto cruel y desgarrado de lo que pudo ser y no fue
Tú y yo, desorientados entre los edificios
Tú y yo, irremediablemente siameses, compartimos el dolor

Y seguiré las coordenadas a tus manos muertas, bajo el sonido de las ambulancias calcinando el esqueleto de nuestra agonía
Y una vez allí, te pediré que me drogues, que prendas el carbón que enterré en mi pecho y me arranques del nihilismo, le herida que me pudre por dentro

Yo desataré mi fauna interior buscando la manera de saciarte, mientras la magia nos hace bailar en círculos alrededor del fuego
Tú y yo, desorientados entre los edificios
Tú y yo, irremediablemente siameses, compartimos el dolor

Vuelvo a ti

If time is just illusion
How can we come to conclusion now?
Will a window into my mind become a door?
Walk through and see before its too late
Things you hold so dear, I don't understand
Can soon disappear
What's this magical side of me?
Bleeding river to the sea
Horizon at dusk so pale so serene
Falcons of flight into infinity
Things you hold so dear, I don't understand
Can soon disappear
What's this magical side of me?
Bleeding river to the sea
Horizon at dusk
So pale so serene
Falcons of flight into infinity

Catch, catch me when I run
I will not fall
The sun … melting glacier's Sun
I will not fall
Situations bleak
I will not fall
Rip tide curl around me
I will not fall…
So up up against this wall
I will not fall
Let me scream until it's gone
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
Vultures ,soar the air
So free from care
Day will rise to say
Tomorrow’s here today!
If this road divides
Will I survive?
Will my fire remain, so that we can change
Oh I will not fall!
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
And I won’t lie down
And I won't play this harp anymore
Odds are stacked some love can bring you bring
You back if you choose
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
I will not fall!
I will not fall!

I'm to blame
What's the same
I don't know
My chest beats like a drum
Will the hammer come down?
I reach out
You just shout
You don't know
My chest beats like a drum
Will we ever come out?
All I knew was life... before
Then I walked out our front door
All along and here for the second wind
Will tell you that someone...loves
And I know that this somethin
Feels real
Oooooooooooooopen your heart
All I knew was life... before
Then I walked out our front door
Ooooooo it's so hard to keep
When love, it cuts you so deep
Open your heart to me

I feel the force
All at once
To ride this lightnin' down
On a pale horse ride right noooooooooooow
If it’s not in your heart
Say it right from start now
And if it’s all in your head
Run to me instead love
There’s nothing here to see
If it’s not in your heart
Say it right from start now
And if it’s all in your head
Run to me instead love
Change, change could be fine
Just guarantee I don’t lose my mind
There, there will be blood
There will be blood between the lines
Oh, so I drink the vine, bathe naked in sunshine
Oh why must battles take so long?
I’ll be strong
Tonight’s the night we’ll be as one
Look towards the future so long
I’ll be strong x 2
Tonight’s the night we’ll be as one
Look towards the future so long x 2
Why must battles so long?
I’ll be strong…

Hey friend, I haven't seen you much
It's my fault, I've been so out of touch
New club? No, you go on ahead
Old blood, I'll dance when I am dead
When I'm dead
I'll dance when I'm dead
That was a killer show
Makes sense to take it on the road
Not me! I can't afford the risk
You tour, I'm on the mailing list
Go ahead
I'll tour when I'm dead
I don't know what else to say
I don't know what else to say
Maybe I'll get to it someday
I see myself at 94
Spare dreams stuck on life support
No wait, if that's what lies ahead
I'll change or put it off and dream when I'm dead
I don't know what else to say
End all my thoughts the same way:
""Maybe I'll get to it someday""
I've been so drunk on safety
I think I'm going crazy
Don't want my ghost to hate me
Time's running

White chairs by the window
As the snow blows across the lawn

She's down in the basement
Hanging pictures on the wall

Places have you noticed
You've got one town where you belong

Slow taste of the intake
Can you slow down and be alone

Oh drive away and come to the show
I wrote a song for you
I've seen witches on the streets of ulster
I've seen witches on the streets tonight

[2x]

Late eyes by the windows
Have a strange love of their own

And they know all the answers
They're spinning records like off the wall

Cancers roll your windows
You've got your town where they belong

[Chorus]

Exajeramos tu perfil
Flotando lento me ves así
Te he dado nubes blancas, te queda
Un amante del riesgo
Sacudo dulce palabras
Ueio ueia de tus tradiciones
Caducan tus promesas
Hay prisa por tu respiro
And i try to be another body
And i try to be you with somebody
But i don't know what to say
But i don't know what to say
But i got it all wrong
So let me go, let me go
Let me go let me go let me go let me go now
Y déjame déjame déjame déjame ir

My hand
Takes you
To the bottom of our year
My legs
Drive you
Learning all your simple steps
And it’s a dream, a dream, a dream about you again
And it’s a dream, a dream, a dream about you again
So, let’s fall down
Again
Let’s lie down here
Till the end
Cause when it’s over
It will start
All over again
It’ll be with you and you and you again
It’ll be with you and you and you again
Take me from you and you and you again
Take me from you and you and you again

Feeling old, you're feeling tired
Let her know you're there
Let me be myself until I die
No one says goodbye

Call her name and the time has come
Trap yourself, it's always dark
Let her know you're there
Let me be myself until I die
No one says goodbye

Her lips are sweet and her face is bright
Stay with her, you're doing fine
Quit your job, you're always high
It's time to go, still no one says goodbye
No one says goodbye

I'll wait for you in iowa
In the house upon the hill
Yesterday tornadoes came
But here we're standing still
I know these past few days have been
The hardest that we've had
Last night we nearly lost it all
But here we're standing still
I would give it all
I'd give it all to you
If only i knew
What it is i've got for you
What i've got to give you
What it is i've got for you
On the day that we pass on
Into nobody knows
May we leave a memory
Of us after the storm
Here standing still
Here we're standing still

I drove away, far from the lake
I found the farmer's daughter
We could have been sisters if i were humble
Clothes muddy, red-cheeked and reticent
I looked around and wished that i could stay
And cover my head
Keep the fire going
Tuck the kids into bed
I know all the hymns
I'd say my prayers and close my eyes
To wake at dawn and do it all over again
So half in jest, i asked if i could stay, help milk the cows
Annie looked away and said just come back in an hour
Asking for more
We ask
We ask for more
For more
We ask
We ask for more
I drove away, back to the lake
Back to all my pretty, precious things - i put the milk away
I started to cry, put the music on to fill the quiet
Oh cluttered life - we try, we try, we try
Asking for more
We ask
We ask for more
Always for more
We ask
We ask for more
Holiest day break our nightmares in two
Holiest day shape our nightmares into threes
Holiest day break take our nightmares before we wake
We ask
We ask

Governments are a sick kind of joke - A sick fuckin' joke
Where the rich get richer & the poor on the breadline stay broke
-Give with one hand, snatch with the other-
How can they justify the money they're paid - all the money they're paid?
When you look at the mess, the mess they've made

I don't wanna die in a nuclear war!

You created a world
Built on hate and lies
Where people are blind
'Till the day they die

People are diseased and
Their minds are a prison

Girl: Why do not you call me love?
Boy: What is love? Is just a chemical reaction...

Drowning... deceiving and bleeding
Best wishes, your words or lies?
Feelings are chemical processes
Love works with dopamine from the brain

When trust was blind
For you it was not good enough [Can’t see the light?]
Don’t play with my mind
Black winter will come inside [Can’t stop the pain?]

The night will come down
Taking now this broken wings [You blackheart!]
The days will pass by
Wishing what can never be [You blackheart!]
The smoke will drift up
From ashes of a shattered dream [You blackheart!]
The past is gone with
Just another dark piece...
...of Blackheart

Break me and shake me ...to hate me!
Deal with it: there’s no love in there
Whispering voices creep all around
Cardiac pulse just pumps your blood alive

I've done my time
Retracing mistakes on and on [Can’t see the light?]
You want to go back
But memories fade to a black hole [Can’t stop the pain?]

I’m killing now my romance
I only need to stay away from you...
I’m killing now my romance
I’m done with dreaming that never comes true...
I’m killing now my romance
The feeding of illusion’s over soon
I’m killing now my romance
I only need to stay away from you...

Amleto: ""...I loved you once.""
Ofelia: ""Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so""
Amleto: ""You should not have believed me [...] I loved you not.""

(Distorted reality...)
(distorted reality...)

I see this world broken down in pieces
A rain of dirty lies fall down on me
A lot of people learn hypocrisy
From puppetters...

Flags of blood call they victory
So-called martyrs, but I can't believe
‘cause it's the time for remembering
Forgotten things...

Red stars, dark sky
A good day to die?
Pay the price, no paradise
A good day to fight!

This is a new war! Because it never ends!
Bullets for you, again and again!
Death from the sky, another hell on earth!
No Way! Until you dance with ghosts!

This is a new war!
And it never ends!
This is a new war!
Again and again!

The down of a new insanity
In the shadow of manipulated ideals
A lot of people forced to disappear
No memories...

My eyes, without tears
A good day to die?
Of your machine I'm not a gear
A good day to fight!

From puppetters.... no memories....
Fall down...
Forgotten things... to disappear....
I can't’ believe....

Five o’clock. Is this a stroke?
My chest hurts and I choke
Will I die now, in my bed?
A question-crowded head…

A grudge in my liver, poison bile
Stains my dreaming, and my mind
Gets weaker, I crack down
No, I can’t breathe

It all flows like vomit
Through my mouth
And all my body concurs
To aerobic liberation of my soul

“La nature est un temple où de vivants piliers
Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles
L'homme y passe à travers des forêts de symboles
Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers

Comme de longs échos qui de loin se confondent
Dans une ténébreuse et profonde unité
Vaste comme une nuit et comme la clarté
Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se répondent

Il est des parfums frais comme de chairs d'enfants
Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies
Et d'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants

Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies
Comme l'ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens
Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens.”

Retrace the panic trail [Back where it began]
The panic – the crash – the fear - the fright
The panic – the crash – the fear to die

There’s no air, I’m blocked inside
Get me out, get me out, get me out of here!
Is nothing hurting, is that blood mine?
Shattered glasses everywhere [You gotta breathe!]

There’s no air, I was denied
For years I’ve kept on swallowing
A thousand screams held in my mouth
Let them out, OUT! [You gotta breathe!]

There’s no air, no matter how hard you try
Shut the fuck up, you’ll never be right!
There’s no air, no mourn allowed
Be strong, be perfect, unbreakable, unbreakable!

Wake up, wake up my every cell
We gotta have control, must have control
Oh brain, my brain against the wall
Who’s the craziest of them all?

[You gotta breathe!] There is no air – the fear – the pain
[You gotta breathe!] There is no air – the fear to fail

Ten drops, you’re free from anger
Ten drops, relieve anxiety
Breathe deep, and find your quiet place
Before you sleep

Ten drops, to ease all stresses
Ten drops, re-energize
Breathe deep, and get your oxygen
Before you blacken out

Ten drops, rebuild your optimism
Ten drops, believe you can
Breathe deep, reroute synapses
Before the crash

I cannot fail, I cannot fall
Be strong, fast, hard, endure, [You gotta breathe!] endure!
Wake up, wake up my every cell
We gotta have control, must have control

There’s no air, I’m deaf and blind
Tired limbs on a manic mind [You gotta breathe!]
There’s no air, I’m dead inside
Get me out, get me out, I gotta breathe!

...Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before

New type, here it comes, of genetic control
Another good religions artifacted
Magnetic waves and fields, are intercepted
Intercepted and looking from satellites

Secrets so deep, burying our history
Comatose sleep starting a war of bit
Digital eyes behind the surface
Collecting the existences of living beings

And now I'll be your torture
The one that buries you!
[...Satisfy...]
Your secluded will to be punished
[...Slay the control, Slay your control...]
Phobia of free will Shall be destroyed
[...In a rapture for freedom...]

With subsequential mind loss is actually low.”

Is making their children strangely psycothic.”

Enter now [And immolate yourself]
This is Eden [Take her gift]
I’ll provide [Enter the promised land]
All you’re dreaming [To sell one's soul!]

I want her hands all over me
I see her face in my pleasant dreams
I feel her touch so cold as fear
And screaming for her fatal kiss!

My Evampire, fallen angel from the sky
There she looks with darkest eyes, for another promised lie
And now pay the price of warmest blood
For the sweetest sin without any doubts
And never let this go, sleeping down below
A thousand poison words... blowing around!

Scream in vain [Not quite like Salome]
She won’t hear you [More like a mantis]
She feeds on pain [She’ll have your head]
That’s why she appeals to you [You’re a walking dead!]

I want her skin as white as snow
I crave her eyes, black as a crow
I need her arms to cover me
""...You're dreaming for Eternity...""

My Evampire, fallen angel from the sky
When you look into her eyes, don't you see another side?
And now pay the price of warmest blood
For the sweetest sin, for an endless love!
And never let this go, she's your evermore
Spreading like black cells of... death inside!

""Domina cupiditatis nostram, fons oblivionis!""

I play my role, cruelly like a child
And you’re my toys, it’s so funny when you die
When you believe every single lie I tell
And dance to my will…You made me what I am!

I'm Evampire, no fucking angel from the sky
Baiting you wit serpent’s eyes, don't you want another lie?
And now pay the price of your weakest blood
For a seducing dream, for your burning lust
I am Babylon, the grave of innocence
Needing merely new flesh for ...my bloody games

I'm walking away
Another day has died
I'm walking alone
I wish to dream again...

All I ask in this life
Is to find some place to rest
Inside my head
Longing to disappear...

Many years without a sun
Wrapped in shadows of the past
It seems already written in the stars
No wind will be so cold
And no rain will be so hard

[Bring to life!] I'm returned from death
[No fear!] burning all the scariest ghosts
[Life’s so frail!] in the sands of desert
[Against the stream!] in the deepest pit of mind
Where the days are dark
When the gravity’s reversed
Resist, be strong, dont' stop, go fast!
Beyond the end!

""A garden of roses
Cold as a dying stone
Sleeping in your bed...
Rest always in my heart...""

As I close my eyes
Heaven and hell together
Did I lose myself in someone else?
If everything fades away
Is it all meant to be empty
Is it all meant to be vain?

""...I wake up to the sound of rain
Lost souls and dead bodies
Hold your life in your hands
Look beyond the light...""

I choose my friends only far too well
I'm up on the pavement, they're all down in the cellar
With their government grants and my I. Q
They brought me down to size, academia blues
Louise is a girl, I know her well
She's up on the pavement, yes she's a weather girl
And I'm staying up here so I may be undone
She's inappropriate, but then she's much more fun and
When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
She's got perfect skin
Shame on you, you've got no sense of grace, shame on me
Ah just in case I might come to a conclusion
Other than that which is absolutely necessary
And that's perfect skin
Louise is the girl with the perfect skin
She says turn on the light, otherwise it can't be seen
She's got cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin
And she's sexually enlightened by cosmopolitan and
When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
For her perfect skin
Yeah that's perfect skin
She takes me down to the basement to look at her slides
Of her family life, pretty weird at times
At the age of ten she looked like greta garbo
And I loved her then, but how was she to know that
When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
She's got perfect skin
Up eight flights of stairs to her basement flat
Pretty confused huh, being shipped around like that
Seems we climbed so high now we're down so low
Strikes me the moral of this song must be there never has been one

As she tries her luck with the traffic police
Out of boredom more than spite
She never finds no trouble, she tries too hard

Jacket of skinned and shivering
Bodies lying in the pile, woah oh oh
A basket of notes organic
Lying, waiting for a smile, woah oh oh
I need you to move much quicker
Western with a second thought, woah oh oh
To flippin' dress rehearsals
Lessons better left untaught, woah oh

I don't know what I'm thinking
(I don't know what I'm thinking)
Blind faith never blinking
(Blind faith never blinking)

Your friend and her tripping children
Nearby falling in the road, woah oh oh
A clip in internal meters
Stopping everything that floats, woah oh oh
I fear for the circles moving
Falling in and out, woah oh oh
I need you to get it over
I don't ever wanna shout, woah oh

I don't know what I'm thinking
(I don't know what I'm thinking)
Blind faith never blinking
(Blind faith never blinking)
I don't know what I'm thinking
(I don't know what I'm thinking)

I would like to fall in love, and then have a broken heart
I don't know if it's better to run away
I’d like to feel your breath, when I must remove bad things

I would like to fall in love, and then have a broken heart
It’s better you run away from me
‘Cause all my life I have been dead inside

And the flowers don't grow up in one night we talk about it so long
I can feel your breath against my ear
You whisper slowly, i can't hear you anymore

We saw the light and now we cry
We saw far and now we're dust

I have frozen the words,how nobody knows
I have to let you know how I feel
I’d like to feel your breath, when I must remove bad things

And the flowers don't grow up in one night we talk about it so long

We saw the light and now we cry
We saw far and now we're dust

I want to know if you can change your life and not betray your own soul, I just want to know but I don't care who you are, I want to know if you can see the beauty and don't hide your eyes, I don't want to know how did you get here
I don't care what you have lived, I don't care how old you are
I want to know if you stay open after betrayals of life, I just want to know, but I don't care who you are, I want to know if you still want to risk and lose your way home, I don't want to know how did you get here
I don't care what you have lived, I want to know what you are now

Some people call me good
Some people call me bad
Some people call me
And I always come

Some people need me
Some people want me
If you think you don’t, don’t worry
'cause you will soon

Soy Diablo
Eres Diablo
I’m you, and you’re me
We’re all burning in hell

When I come to your call
You got nothing at all
Sitting all alone singing, ""Poor me""

Make a deal with me
And when we come to agree
We’ll shake hands and you’ll see
Hat I’m you and you’re me

Soy Diablo
Eres Diablo
I’m you, and you’re me
We’re all burning in hell

So you say you’re religious
Praying, ""Woe is me""
I don’t care what you call it
'Cause you’re all going down with me

The only God I know
Is the same I just told
You and me
Me and you
Mankind
We’re all burning in hell

Soy Diablo
Eres Diablo
I’m you, and you’re me
We’re all burning in hell

The name of this song is ""Today More Than Any Other Day""
Parts 4 through 43, so open up your textbooks or a magazine
Or a novel; any kind of reading material will do
Okay, here we go
One, two, three!
Well, today, more than any other day, I am excited to feel the milk of human kindness
And today, more than any other day, I am excited to go grocery shopping
And today, more than any other day, I am prepared to make a decision between 2% and whole milk
And today, more than any other day, I look into the eyes of the old man across from me on the train and say
""Hey, everything's gonna be okay!""
(Yes!)
(What's that?)

Does the radio play but hey, it's okay
Because today, more than any other day, I am the center of everything and it's playing just for me
And everything is gonna be okay, together, today, together, today, together, okay, together
We're all, all, all the fucking—
Well today, together, today, together, today, together, today, together
We're all, all, all the fucking—
Well today, together, today, together, today, together, today, together
We're all, all, all the fucking same

Something crawled into your pleasant heart
And cried out for your head
Said, ""Who will leave the body now?""

When you're living in the shell

Screaming ""How do I get out?""

Something crawled into your pleasant heart

I don’t even know what to say
I don’t even know what to say
What, where, when, and why and how
Did you get the notion now
That year after year, we put a quarter in the wall
What’s that now? We fell in line, and

How long you been waiting?
How long you been waiting?

There is something, something you believe in
But you can't touch it and you can't hold it
There is something, something you believe in
And you can't wait for it to take a way a bit of time
In a nonspecific party, in a nonspecific city
Or anywhere
Anyway you feel this way like this song or that song
Act like you feel it but it doesn't heal you, it doesn't make you smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And is there something you were trying to express?
It’s not that you need it, it’s that you need it
Is there something you were trying to express?
And you can't get on without it, and you can't get on without it
Is there a weight that you were trying to unload here?
But you just can't get it, you can't get it off now
And when you get it, get it in your bloodstream
And you feel at home with it but you just can't get relief

[Chorus]
And there it comes again
And you give in again
And there it comes again
Your limitation
And there it comes again
And you give in again
And you give in again
Your limitation

[Pre-Chorus]
And is there something you were trying to express?
Express it with me, express it with me
And is there something you were trying to express?
Something I needed? Is that I need it
Is there a weight that you were trying to unload here?
But you just can't get it, you can't get it off now
And when you get it, get it in your bloodstream
And you just feel whole with it but you just can't get relief

[Chorus]
And there it comes again
And I give in again
And there it comes again
My limitation
And now it comes again
And you give in again (Ha!)
And I give in again
My limitation

Why I think I, I see it coming
Because I recognize it when I see it
Well, do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I need to know I'm not alone any—
Well I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
Well I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming

I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
Do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I need to know I'm not alone
And cause I need it and I believe in it
And I think that I can't live without it
Well I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
A habit, a habit, a habit, a habit, a habit
Well I feel a, I feel a
A habit, a habit, a habit, a habit

Do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I need to know I'm not alone

I retain the right to be disgusted by life
I retain the right to be in love with everything in sight
And when a cold, cold breeze
Picks you up and takes you high above the trees and
When your eyes roll back into your skull, say
It's not that I can see but that I feel you
And when you moaned all night
Said I don't think that I will ever sleep again
'Cause I've found it, I'm waiting
Half of my life
And there's an ease in your eyes
Once you see the lines
And when I moaned all night
I said I think that I have finally lost my mind
But you say keep in mind, you say keep in mind
You say keep in mind, say keep in mind

Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell

I retain the right to have an end in sight
I retain the right to be absolutely mystified
And when a cold, cold rain
Makes you think that you will never be so clean
When you're caught up in bearing the same weight again
You're moving, you're weightless
You're more than a friend
And when you moaned all night
Keep on saying there is still a place in time
And that place it is saying that you're one of a kind
Yeah you're one of kind, one of a kind

Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell

Are you a Gemini? Are you the stars that aligned?
Are you my friend tonight?

Well see I know I'm something in your life
Well see I know I'm something in your mind

He was old enough to know
So when he asked if the impossible were true
She thought he'd want her to
Tell it like it is and so she did
He had experienced the innocence of being a kid
But she wanted readiness to be rewarded

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweetheart (sweetheart), keep your curiosity
If people have a problem they can deal with me

[Chorus 1]
I don't mind if I do offend
'Cause I think it's understood
Kids can't know, must we condescend?
They don't need excuses to be good
Get off on good behaviour for now, but someone tell me how
A culture could allow this to be and I vow
They don't need excuses to be good

[Verse 2]
Then the waterworks began
She took a moment to reflect on her decision
As tears obscured his vision
She gave his eyes a chance to dry
The chance she took was worth it
'Cause now his eyes are fully open
Exactly what she had been hoping, hey

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sweetheart (sweetheart), I thought it then, I think it still
Nothing's gonna be if you just wish it will

[Chorus 2]
I don't mind if I do offend
'Cause I think it's understood
The lights are on, must we all pretend
That we need excuses to be good
But some remain in the dark even now, so someone tell me how
A culture could allow this to be and I vow
You don't need excuses now, but someone tell me how
The culture could allow this to be, take no vow
It only confuses, you don't need excuses to be good

[Verse 1 (Theme 1)]
You say you're going with me, I say we're going together
You're giving lessons to me, I'm quoting you to the letter

[Chorus 1 (Theme 1)]
You're revolutionary
It's such a load to carry

[Verse 2 (Theme 1)]
You're overplaying to calm me, the playing field's on the level
And anyone can agree it's not a vote for the devil

[Chorus 2 (Theme 1)]
It doesn't make any sense to reassemble your fence
Our revolution is now, the place we're going is better

[Break (Theme 1)]
You say you're going with me
You say you're going with me
You say you're going with me

[Verse 3 (Theme 2)]
Don't ask for a second chance
It's too late for that
We can make a small amendment to your sensitive side but
You'll have to price for that
Decide whose side you're playing upon
While you're diffusing the bomb
I didn't know how you could it with the grease in your palms
We'll call it tit for tat

[Verse 4 (Theme 2)]
Do the things I do and you can read between the lines
And don't be too surprised when no one's listening
Limping from the field, you never laud your Valentines
And who's to blame for that?

[Verse 5 (Theme 3)]
How does it feel
When you're motionless and can't perform?
What does it mean
When the world you've left can't be reformed?
'Cause like it or not
You're gonna find a tight spot at least a couple of times a day
Then you reveal
All the tools you so relied upon

[Verse 6 (Theme 4)]
Well, there's something happening and it don't seem right
Too many people liked it way too uptight
This isn't a race, man, there won't be any winners
Every time you wake up, you're just another fucking beginner
So there's something happening that just don't seem right
Grow a spine instead of living absent in plain sight (ah)

[Break (Theme 4)]
There's many methods to mad
Like take your hands from your pockets when you go down to the back

[Verse 7 (Theme 4)]
There's something happening here for sure, I'll bite
The big stars in your eyes won't deliver any light

[Bridge 1 (Theme 4)]
Do you think she loves you?
Do you show that you care?
Can you rise up above her?
Do you feel heavy?

[Verse 8 (Theme 4)]
What I thought after what I said (what you said)
Would never mean a thing to anyone (ah)
And then what you wrote and then what I read (what you read)
'Cause you won't tag along with me

[Verse 9 (Theme 5)]
I can't believe you never told me the truth
About all the reasons for you cutting me loose
If I've a legion to bear, you could wear it
And all the hope that springs

[Chorus 3 (Theme 5)]
What it does is unexplainable
What it is is unsustainable

[Verse 10 (Theme 5)]
I couldn't tell that you were always so lonesome
You never typed it on your cellular phone
An application for that's in the backup
And all the luck it brings

[Chorus 3 (Theme 5)]
What it is is unsustainable
What it does is unexplainable

[Verse 11 (Theme 6)]
You said you were going with me
It's evolutionary
You said that you would come with me
Now I only pull when it's free
So what will it mean?

[Verse 12 (Theme 2)]
I asked for a proper glass
Half full is fine
But if you really need it perfect, have it carved in some stone
We're running out of time

[Verse 13 (Theme 3)]
And how did it feel?
How did it feel?
How did it feel when outside forces pushed toward home?
Can you conceal?
Can you conceal your status symbols all on loan?
Let's make a deal
Let's make a deal, we're leaving well enough alone

[Verse 14 (Theme 7)]
Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping away
(Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da)
Sometimes it feels like I'm so awake
(Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da)

[Verse 15 (Theme 7)]
They don't expect you, just give it away
I can't express this any other way
So don't pretend you got something to say
Cast out your net and wait for another day
They don't expect you to slip 'em away
If you motion me this way, I'll go thataway

[The Lesson (Theme 8)]

[Verse 16 (Theme 8)]
Inside a cloud, a light less glowing
I get the sense
That you've preyed on personal mind blowings
Here in the present tense
So how much love is left to give?
Ten thousand tons or more would be my guess, oh

[Chorus 4 (Theme 8)]
And we're saying a prayer for you
If we can understand it, why can't you?

[Verse 17 (Theme 8)]
You know I hear in terms of colours
Always sliding on scales and bumping into one another
So if happiness lies deep within us
How come most deny it for themselves, oh?

[Chorus 4 (Theme 8)]
And we're saying a prayer for you
If we can understand it, why can't you?

[Solo]

[Chorus 4 (Theme 8)]
We'll be saying a prayer for you
If we can understand it, why can't you?

[Verse 18 (Theme 8)]
There's a tunnel that I can't see through

How you got that girl
How you got that girl (oh yeah)
How you got that girl
How you got that girl

[Verse 1]
Was it my imagination?
Did you come out of the past?
You had horses behind you
But I didn’t want to ask

You’re so independent
You never needed nothing
Never needed no one
Never wanted to have fun

[Chorus]
That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along

[Verse 2]
You were standing on the corner
You were waiting for the beast
You had stories of prophets
But I didn’t want to tease

Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire

[Chorus]
I should have known right from the start
When you count on nothing, nothing falls apart
And then we stayed out all night
And in the morning you had second sight

That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along

[Outro]
Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire

Give me all your love now
Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow

I can't go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
Cause all I hear is ""I'm not ready enough""

And I can tell that you didn't have
To face your mother losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Cause she didn't have time

I don't want to judge what's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?

So let's love fully and let's love loud
And let's love now
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die

"

[Verse 1]
You gave up on me way too fast
Our parents would have never done that
Give me time and I'll prove you that
I am better than what I showed you last

[Verse 2]
You're sick and tired of seeing me cry
You don't know how to calm me down
Please read me poems and make me laugh
Remind me how lucky I am

[Refrain]
You wonder why I hit myself?
I'm trying to kill the worst of me
To be the best for you
To be the best for you

[Verse 3]
You haven't spoken a word for days
You write it all down, you say it keeps you alive
You grew a beard to hide behind
So I cannot read your mind
I cannot read your mind
I cannot read your mind

[Verse 4]
You build walls no one could climb
And bury yourself in your victorian mind
You said ""Forget it, it's better like that""
And since I've lost all sense and meaning of life

[Refrain 2]
Now, where do our story end?
No, I'm not ready to move on
I know that you're the best for me
I'll be the best for you

[Verse 5]
You gave up on me way too fast
But don't be a stranger at last
Give me time and I'll prove you that

[Refrain 3]
I'm trying to kill the worst of me
To be the best for you
To be the best for you...

[Verse 1]
[?] we've been told what to do
I didn't realise either mate, I'm with you
I've been following white lines all my life
Touché Turtle, jump the castle, avoid the disco dancers
No hassle, doing beak like that with a kid at your mums
Paramedics, you shoulda thought about that one
Heart stopper,  boom clear
What happened to Richard, all I can see is gear
Breathless, incinerate, processed cheese
Become what you hate, become what we are
A series one with dreams to reach a series four
Drive, dive, six packs, drive, drive, white teeth, kit-kat
Take the money and run, join the elite
You sold yourself to no-one
Pied piper, whiskey notes, the wonderwall fell down on you

[Chorus]
A little ditty and it's all gone wrong
I don't expect the tools to sing along
A little ditty and it's all gone wrong
A little ditty
A little ditty

[Verse 2]
I ain't a threat, they leave me alone [?]
You know when I worked there I got a bad feeling from a man
I can't work with someone like that again, Sam
A little ditty and it's all gone wrong
I don't expect the kid to sing along
That band from the '80s that punk band what are they called
The Queen's Park Rangers
Been around ages you tool
We're all up in the top room of the pub
Getting heavy with the past that didn't exist
You reshape to give celeb mates Shoreditch yarn
In the, have you been for a poo-poo barn
Gnarly coke death faces
Death, death, death, death, nine to a cubicle
Like squeezing, screwing-up faces
Last choke push the wheels of the next big thing
You scratch my back, I don't scratch anything
Apart for my nads
Oy Mick I'm born to be bland
Jumped up in black leather
Flints, death, currywurst
Smashed, and in everything

[Chorus]

I get a shaky start to Tuesday
Sweat stains on bus windows
I don't want ruin my coat but
That’s just the way it goes
“Cheer up you fuckin’ bastard!”
That’s all I heard him say
St George’s flag on white van
This is the human race

This is the human race
UKIP and your disgrace
Chopped heads on London streets
All you zombies tweet, tweet, tweet

These wheels are turning tricks
This bus is full of pricks
8 hours of Gedling Council fuck your life
It’s spare room hassle
Dead weight is living flesh
We are no longer spesh
These grips that pull my hair
A life not lived ‘cos I don’t care

This is the human race
UKIP and your disgrace
Chopped heads on London streets
All you zombies tweet, tweet, tweet

Well I just bit half a mine
Throw myself on the Metroline
We 'ad to walk back from the train
With the Stella kicking in my brain

Well I just bit half a mine
Throw myself on the Metroline
When I walk back from the train
With the Stella kicking in my brain

Everyone has challenges in their life, every day
Some of them are small
Or some of them are big, massive issues that can make or break you
Or when you're a child, if you're lucky, you've got you parents there to help and support you
But When you become an adult, you have to learn to cope with these things on your own
But we can always support each other
No matter what you're doing right now;
Working, chilling, walking down the street, driving your car, whatever
Listen to my words and hopefully they'll give you some strength
Now I know you can do it, I know I can do it to
Just support me and I'll support you

Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
No way, no way now I'm
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
In this life
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
I can do it on my own, even if I'm all alone
I can feel it in my heart, I can feel it in my bones
It won't bring me down
No it won't, no it won't
All I need is food and water and a place to call home
If I take to the sky like a bird on the wind
I deserve better things, even if I have sin
I can make it, gotta lay the foundation
So I can look back and say I never let it break
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
No way, no way now I'm
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
In this life
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
You're not going down without a fight
You're not going down without a fight
You're not going down without a fight
You're not going down without a fight
We ain't going down without a fight

Now they've sewn up both your eyes
But I still miss you
Its a delicate disguise
But I can see through

And I still don't feel used

We will go
No control
We will go indigo

And it all went down the drain
All the photos lost their meaning
Never saw that side again
Don't forget what gets you high
So you can hold yourself together
When you're running out of time

I had a heart
But yeah, you fucked it up forever
Things just never came to light
And now I'm holding on to never
I don't want to have the chance
To see the world without your hands
There's only so much I can stand

So it all went down the drain

Living out my wasted time
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide

Staring through a hollow heart
We were all out of luck
It was never enough

Angels crying in the streets
Somewhere underneath
He's inside of me

Emptiness becomes a home
All you'll ever know
It was never enough

Sorry for what you became
But who can be blamed?
I know you know

Living in a hollow heart
We were fucked from the start
It was never enough

We cut ties to live again
All the places you've never been
Are you ever  going to find them?

I don't know if I ever knew
How it came to be so soon
If I ever would have come through
We'll never know

It took time to love again
It had gone so awful then
Things never meant to happen

Found a way, a little black balloon
Never had enough to lose
Now they're never going to find you
They'll never know

I stay high to pass the time
Burn away the afterlife
Trapped inside your angel eyes
Wasted now the light has died

I have always been prepared
Find me in your darkest fears
Dream gate get me out of here
Drifting in the thinnest air

Rusty old hands
Blood fills the sky
You're all my friends
Trust my disguise
I live in bars
You tread thin ice
They locked you in
Sewed up your eyes

I wore your clothes
I took your pills
I lived alone, it was a thrill
You led me in down in this shoe
Now there is nothing left for me to do

You'll come crashing down
On me

"
112327,"

I've got all the remedies
Let's jump out of our minds
Melt into our eyes
Those pretty lights

Cause we're not fond of anyone
They fucked us up
Now we can't love anymore

You hate all my melodies
But i know they'll work
And after church i hope it hurts

You gave me misery
You wrecked my head
Remember when you thought
That you had a friend

"
112328,"

Broke even with a traveling man
Circuit rider in my head
And I know we got time to sin
Before we fall in their traps again

We could fly off into the sun
I could be the only one
Nevertheless it's been such fun
But our lives just never would

I'm sick of falling behind
Black circles forming under my eyes
Not much of me left alive
Brokenhearted safe disguise

Circuit rider comes to me
Every night into my dreams
But it took so long to see
That you too were make believe

"
112329,"

If somebody loved me
Then maybe I'd survive
And we'd sit by the harbor
To stall our empty lives

If you don't look back
Then I won't look back
If you don't give a damn
Then I won't give a damn
And If you call out, I won't answer
And if time runs out
Then it won't matter
And if you call out
I won't answer

"
112330,"

Oh, can't you see that it's a long way to be leaving
A long way home
And hey, I think that it's best that
We probably stop believing 'cause time's a slow game
And though I see it in the seasons
It doesn't matter what you're feeling
So strange to think that what you're stealing
Is everything I'm needing

"
112333,"

Así: piel contra piel, poro contra poro
Dudo que esta flor pueda volver a marchitarse
Sí, supongo que perdí la perspectiva con el tiempo
No sé si fui yo quien se marchó o tú quien se quedó
Y tal vez, cuando los cerezos florezcan en mi propio Macondo
Negro y cautivo, pueda volver a buscarme en
Las constelaciones de tu espalda
O en el centro del pecho, donde todos guardamos nuestro abismo
Hincando las corneas
Voy a hacer de tripas corazón con otra canción inofensiva
A despertar, aprender a vivir entre la carne y el deseo
Descansar, dejar la sangre correr
Y apreciar lo efímero de las cosas

"
112334,
112335,"

El frío tropical
Me cala hasta los huesos
El frío tropical
Me cala hasta los huesos

"
112336,
112337,"

Si tu cuerpo es una isla yo soy el mar, la marea salvaje
Cada noche te rodeo tratando de alcanzarte y apenas llego a ti
Sí, cada noche me crezco tratando de alcanzarte
Dolido por la herida
Si tu cuerpo es una isla yo soy el mar
Domado en tus ojos de sal

Oh flor de fango, carne y barro
Es tan peligrosa esta sangre, más dolorosa dentro que fuera
La rabia y la miel, juntas otra vez
Oh flor de fango, carne y barro
Es tan peligrosa esta sangre, más dolorosa dentro que fuera
La rabia y la miel, juntas otra vez

"
112338,"

Quiero sentir el tiempo pasando sobre mi
La condición natural de cada instante
Quiero arder, prender la noche, bañar mi cuerpo en llamas
Hacer de mi carne un festival de fuego
Y prender mis áridos pulmones
Los que tu solías regar con sangre hasta hacerlos florecer

Con falso optimismo me lleno las manos
Tal vez es hora de afrontar que siempre esperé demasiado
Que me sigo buscando en los demás
Pero lo cierto es que no me encuentro si no es en tus ojos
Que no me reconozco si no es sobre ti
Encuentro en mis pulmones la última frontera
Tomo aliento y por un instante
El cielo está más cerca

Y ahora recuerdo cuando era niño
La sal, el agua, el verano
A veces me refugio en el recuerdo, me resguardo en él
Sobre todo ahora que aún puedo verte a días de aquí
Víctima de un mal que creí pasajero:
La ciudad, las agujas, los impulsos, el veneno
Llegó todo a la vez

Pero sabed que la guerra solo duele cuando es bella
Y que en mi suerte de infelicidad, en mi extraño dolor
Seguiré bailando esta triste danza sin otra meta que el propio exilio
Que la dulce violencia de buscar eterna tu figura imposible

Si pudieran salvarme tus manos

Flor de carne que naces en mí
Nutre mis mares, anega mis puertos
Yo no elegí vestir la herida
En el pálpito de mis sentidos
Puedo sentir tu dulce sombra
El barro corriendo por mis venas

"
112339,
112340,"

Flor de carne que naces en mí
Nutre mis mares, anega mis puertos
Yo no elegí vestir la herida
En el pálpito de mis sentidos
Puedo sentir tu dulce sombra
El barro corriendo por mis venas

Y ahora, tu recuerdo es un joven continente a la deriva, la marea báltica
Una negra latitud que apresa mi dolor transcontinental
El cansancio de quien no pertenece a ningún sitio
Y no hay gloria, es solo ceniza, mi voz quemada encontrando justicia en tus ojos
Venciendo el salitre de los muertos
Sé que mi cuerpo encendido aprende lentamente
Pero ahora no puedo dejar de sangrar

"
112341,"

Cuando el cielo nos arranque las manos ya no estaré en armonía con mis entrañas
Es un impulso al vacío, la lucha por la lucha, una ceremonia animal
Guardo mi sangre guerrera desvistiendo la herida en tus ojos
El dolor me sienta bien, el dolor me sienta bien

De algún modo me levantaré

Y bajo mi piel la marea: la sed implacable naciendo por fin
Este es mi legado: un regalo de carne y flor

Me derramo a corte limpio contra la noche
Siento la rabia desgastarse, la marea drenando rojo al cielo
Me arranco el pulso: el frío perenne cubre mis dedos
Apenas ya me queda corazón, cansado de rehacerme a golpes

Es el precio a pagar
Es el precio a pagar por estas canciones
Es el precio a pagar
Es el precio a pagar por estas canciones

Es el precio a pagar
Yo solía ser libre en las coordenadas de tu piel
Te miraré a los ojos: volveremos a nacer
Te miraré a los ojos: volveré a levantarme ileso
Todo es carne y flor
Solo carne y flor

"
112342,"

Veo nacer madreselva que estalla sus labios
La savia dulce y gris es como el licor de su cintura
Trépame, asómate a mí, anidaremos en tus ramas
Oh madreselva: haz de mi herida un invierno floral

Desde mis pulmones hasta algún lugar de mis entrañas
Masticaré mi dolor
Y si vence el puñal se hunde en la carne esbelta es la herida
Que las flores me coronen

"
112343,"

Quiero sentir el tiempo pasando sobre mi
La condición natural de cada instante
Quiero arder, prender la noche, bañar mi cuerpo en llamas
Hacer de mi carne un festival de fuego
Y prender mis áridos pulmones
Los que tu solías regar con sangre hasta hacerlos florecer

Con falso optimismo me lleno las manos
Tal vez es hora de afrontar que siempre esperé demasiado

"
112344,"

Voy a sangrarte a hasta que no quede nada de ti, a romper tu corona
Siento el vértigo clavarse en el diafragma: tu recuerdo es cal viva
Y ahora, voy a lamer mi cicatriz en lo mas íntimo del dolor
Brazos mellados para hacerme comprender que el cementerio no pasa por aquí

Y cuando las bestias acaricien mi sexo, me arrancaré las amapolas hasta encontrarme el pulso
Que nazca el fuego bajo la sangre seca, prendiendo mi cuerpo y quebrando el magnetismo

Voy a dibujar con tinta carmesí una gran cruz en tu rostro, voy a hacer de esta oración mi pequeña catedral, un refugio contra el frío del invierno
Ya estoy cansado de arañarme el pecho buscando, entre el flujo denso y oscuro, la materia osea de este dolor, la materia osea del recuerdo

Lejos, donde el mar se hace agujas y el cielo se incendia, dejaré vivir los esqueletos – dejaré que me devoren – No somos fuego, no somos carne, no somos sal
Es el dolor de incinerarme en cada línea, entregarme a las ascuas, entregarme al fuego hasta reconstruir este cuerpo de ceniza
Hasta encontrar la manera de levantarme como un lobo abatido

"
112347,
112348,"

Que tiemble el fuego eterno

"
112349,"

Tus ojos son el frío atlántico, cubren mi cuerpo con escarcha
Oh, reina de bruma, no alcanzo a ver tu rostro a través de la niebla
El invierno es largo en Reikiavik, construyamos una catedral con fuego y sal, hasta que nazca el sol de media noche para prenderlo todo

"
112350,"

Cuando el Gran Danés abre las fauces, ni si quiera el sol puede competir con toda la fricción que se desprende
Parece querer tragarse el mundo al verlo amanecer

Nadie muere bajo el sol

Ella es la pregunta y la respuesta
Veo su figura reflejada en la niebla
No hay nadie que rompa la escarcha en mis venas
Nadie

I only want to lie down here
I see red lights right in front of me
They aren't tongues of fire
It's my only desire

You better give up

You can scream, shrinking my mind
You can beat me, I don’t feel the pain
You can hunt me down in fire
Now you make me lose everything

Every touch to your skin is one step to perfect sin
Every beat of your heart brings me back to the start

You can scream, shrinking my mind
You can beat me, I don’t feel the pain
You can hunt me down in fire
Now you make me lose everything

I’ve been running and
I’ve been screaming and
I’ve been crawling after you
I’ve been sayin’ that
I don’t need it
But damnit, I still do
But you, you don’t know all the lengths I would go
And I can’t help but think, how sweet it’d be
You’ve been folding and
You’ve been dark blue and
You’ve been steady all this time
You’ve been acting
So apathetic
But damnit I’m on fire
And I, I don’t know where you sleep, where you go
But I can’t help but think, how sweet it’d be
I’m your wiltin rose, I’ll get myself undressed, I will
I’ll close my eyes until I love you a little less, I will
Oh I believe
How sweet it would be
I’ll show you
I’ve been patient and
I’ve been worthy and
I will let you bring me down
You’re my sunset
My masterpiece
Slipping through my fingers now
And I, I don’t know, anything about letting go
So I’ll sit here and think, how sweet it’d be

Feel like a question
Looking for an answer
Never gonna find it
Never wanna get there

Caught up in reflections
Just another mirror
Keeps from/on getting clearer
That's when I saw
Little girl a' hiding
Afraid I'm really dying

Not living at all

Someone steps out
Out into the garden
Promise .... evening
Miss the .... thing

That's when it hit me
Everything is breed in

We're all so busy dying
Your heart has not been crying

Feel like a question
Looking for an answer
Never gonna find it
Never gonna get there

Caught up in reflections
Just another mirror
Keeps from/on getting clearer
That's when I saw
Little girl hiding
Afraid I'm really dying

Not living at all

Your heart has not been aching
Thousand pieces breaking

Not living at all

Paraty paradise
Parachute into my life
Paraty, paradise exists

Morning sun on the lazy beach
Waterfalls awaiting
Take a swim in the salty sea

Coconut and acai
Mango juice and coffee
Take a sip, take some time to be

Paraty prirateman
Parasail to the island
Paraty paradise
Parachute into my life
Paraty, paradise exists
Paraty, paradise exists

{araty, paradise exists

Brefeet in the golden sand
Take a walk up the ancient thath
Through the jungle, leaves and vines and roots

Butterflies, blue and red
Lead the way overhead
To the river, water sweet and fresh

Paraty prirateman
Parasail to the island
Paraty paradise
Parachute into my life
Paraty, paradise exists

El verano ya se fue
Mi memoria siente cambios
Ilumina mi historia cuando el frio llega a mi

Cuando el frio llega a mi
Mi vida ve el Sol caer
Amantes se abrigan bien con colchas
Zapatos para dormir por playa
Queriada no esperes
Dime que me amas, me quieres, me adoras
Y el frio nunca voy a parar
El fuego en mi amor mas grande que el mar
Adentro de ti
Cuando el frio llega a mi
Mi vida ve el Sol caer
Amantes se abrigan bien con colchas
Zapatos para dormir
Cuando el frio llega a mi
Mi vida ve el Sol caer
Amantes se abrigan bien con colchas

I’m driving in my car
Upon this crowded star
It’s been my longest night
Under this full moon light
As her brother Sun begins to rise

The new year’s passed it’s almost dawn
My present situation is this song
It turns my life into a reel
I sit back and watch it play

The clock it ticks it never stops
Melting memories into teardrops
Shedding my past lives, loves, and everlasting pain and joy

But I’m in the future now
With feet on the earth and hands on the branches that I climb
Within the waves that carry me
And now I’m sinking deep into her soul
Like floating in the ocean we breathe to control
The rhythm of our place in time
In cycles of existential rhyme

Y el otro día la ví
En el apartamento
El otro día la ví
Me puse menso
Planchaba su ropa con su alma caliente
Cocinaba la sopa con su alma caliente

Su piel era obscura
Esencia de ricura
Su pelo tan largo
Le llegaba al trasero
Y me envenenaba con una sola mirada
Suspiraba tan profundo
Que me quede sin aire

Y el otro día le hablé
La invité a salir
Y no la pensé mucho y me dijo que sí

Y qué bonito se sentía mi corazón
Que bonito se sentía mi corazón con razón
Samoana preciosa calentando mi corazón
Samoana preciosa cantaba cantando su son

Libre como el mar
Cuando brillamos en la pista
Gozando de la noche
Moviéndonos al disco
Moviendo al compás
De su corazón palpitando
Y sudor va cayendo
De su labios
Quiere ser...

It's a balloon far away that I can see far away
Like the balloon flying away that is usually seen
And it has an odd shape in the distance
That doesn't diminish it stays in my sight
And doesn't finish

Then a slight swirl
Takes over my mind
My irises return
After being miles away!

Then I find that there's no balloon
Like the balloon usually seen
But some type of insect
Like the insect
Usually hanging right in front of me

And I walk towards it and I take another step
Now I find myself right below, right below, it...
Now here I am!
Below the spider
Hanging from its thread
Hanging from the tree

No it's not a balloon far away that I can see far away
No it's not a balloon far away
No it's not a balloon far away
No it's not a balloon

Soniatl sigue soniando suenos alegres
Porque el amarillo es tu color
Iban corriendo ligartijas, volando hace ella por su sangre caliente

Tu podras curar nuestro dolor

Y abres los ojos, despiertas, y el sol te sonrie
Pero el mundo esta pesado y te sientes un poco triste
A veces piensas que en este mundo no la haces
Pero te digo amiga mia para liberar el mundo tu naciste

Y tu mente corre por el mundo y quieres viajar
Piensas en Cuba, Venezuela, y en revolucionar
Creando conscienca en ninos con literatura
Sentado en arbol le canto a mi amiga la pura

Salut, je m'appelle Jean Pierre
You'll recognize me from Paris as if you've gone there
Tanned skin, dark brown not blond hair
I make the ladies tremble like I was a bomb scare

Cigarette between lip
Take a hit then a white wine sip
I wear speedos when I take a dip
And I eat French fries not chip

Rolling around sur ma bicyclette
With a garland of garlic around my neck
Pullover patterned with stripes
Not spotted and not chequed
Never have a different hat: a beret's a safe bet

I hate your guts
Never make me rush
I've got a lazy strut
To make the ladies blush

I hate your guts
Never make me rush
I've got a lazy strut
To make the ladies blush

*mwah mwah*
Always kiss both cheek
Go on holiday for 16 week
I make sounds when I speak
Like: Uhhhhhh… je ne sais pas

Everybody in the audience
Play on your accordions
Everybody in the audience
Play on your accordions

Now everybody dance
Everybody let's dance let's dance (Comme quoi? Comme quoi? )
Like a man from France
Like a man from France (Stereotypical)

Now everybody dance
Everybody let's dance let's dance (Comme quoi? Comme quoi? )

My mustache is paper thin
Never have a bare head a beret's the thing
As I lean upon the bar with a lazy grin
Sippin' on a white wine it's my favorite drink

My mustache is paper thin
Never have a bare head a beret's the thing

Into the path that I am taking in my life
Is conducted when I try to sleep
Or even shut my eyes

True burdens guilt and fear
Condemn the recent and the end
Another bridge to cross
Another obstacle to contend with on the way
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?

You say I've gone too far
I drag mistakes like rope
And then choose the rough terrain
I can't ignore my scars
They mark the man I want to be so bad again
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?

My dreams are where I take refuge
The one place I can live a life beyond my touch
But still I yearn for insomnia
To force myself to make them real
It can't take much

What is there left to do
When all you do is torment yourself?
You suffer sleepless nights
Through paranoia and your selfish sense of plight
So do you have a reason why?
Or are you just scared to lose this fight?

You say I've gone too far
I drag mistakes like rope
And then choose the rough terrain
I can't ignore my scars
They mark the man I want to be so bad again
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?

So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?

You say I've gone too far
I drag mistakes like rope
And then choose the rough terrain
I can't ignore my scars
They mark the man I want to be so bad again
No I don't think I'm fine
But I'm just living with the pain

Never did no wrong
Never did enough
Ever make a song and dance
For fancy folk you thought were above you?
Throw your hat at it
Out hops a rabbit
He points a paw and laughs at your ceaseless pursuit of love
But oh those simple melodies
They put your mind at ease
Here in this world of your own
A world of your own creation

Give it all you got
Think you’re fine, but you’re not
Ambitions rot because you left them far too long on the shelf
Deep down you insist
That you’re an idealist
Do you remember optimistic you, how good she felt? No?
Do you recall your altruistic view, your heart of wealth? No?
Then the simple energies
Are all that you need
Here in this world of your own

If you’re distracted by the bitterness you face
Kicking back against the rats within your race
If the world makes you struggle getting out of bed
Girl there’s no trouble, make another one to live within instead
And get out of your head!

Now you gaze into the trees
And graze on twitching leaves
Here in this world of your own
All of your own

"
114315,"

Is this a mating display that’s gone and lost its way?
Your little pantomime has wasted quite enough of my time
You know that needlessly striving, weakness-denying
Steady degradation is worse
So don’t you worry about the living and dying
Puking and crying
Just leave it to the experts

Walking on the wind
Your words ain’t coming in loud and clear
Cos you’re talking nonsense
Truth it bends in a torus when the cracks appear

I don’t care about your imagined conquests
Supposed banging-prowess
Your fickle outlook
How many merry go round routes you took
And while sea eagles are flying
You’re ego-supplying
Shovelling your crumbling self-worth
Your grasp upon the monomyth’s tenuous
Obscene, disingenuous
Your true emancipation will hurt

Walking on the wind
Your words ain’t coming in loud and clear
Cos you’re talking nonsense
Yeah, you’ve friends
But what makes you think that they want to hear your bullshit?

Cos I’m a chest beater - I’m a born leader
I’m a dispute feeder
An affection needer
Let all the rest peter away their time
Neither standing here nor there
While I hide my despair beneath choreographed airs and graces
And Instagram faces I’m bouncing off walls
Making you feel small and peaceful by comparison
It’s embarrassing that this well-worn and jaded show
Is all I know

"
114316,"

A silent blue electric sound
Arrests your ears, rolls around
And it consumes the empty fields between your thoughts
It feels serene, but you’re not a bit immune
Or able to resist
It speaks the language of your soul
Takes you by the wrist
Pulls you from your hole
Into the night

Fly in inverted castle dreams
Replace your eyes
It’s not what it seems
It’s not in you
No it’s not And it can’t bring you away
From the life your heart wishes for
It speaks the language of your soul Takes you by the wrist
Pulls you from your hole
Fills you with light

When it’s over, you’ll be older
And wiser too
With a strong head on your shoulder
Nice to climb into
Strike a balance
Let this challenge embolden you
And it’s over before you know it
Its hold on you

"
114317,"

What’s wrong with you?

Sitting on a precious mountaintop
Observing the trees
Swaying in the breeze
Doing just as they please
Your shadow peeps out from beneath a rock And whistles a tune
“Your time is coming soon…”
Swap the sun for the moon

A plague of fantasies descends upon
This haven of mine
And though I know I’m fine
It’s amazing to watch them dine
They're tearing the horizon from the ground
It’s cracking like ice
They’re pulling me inside
Where nothing is born, or dies

We’ll fashion a mask of all your paper planes
(you love it too, don’t you? love it)
Get passionless, bask in awe
Your growing pains hold sway in your head
Groundless and extreme
The source of your dread distressful dreams
If you don’t love it
Why don’t you chuck it out?

A hair emerges from my head
It’s boldly grey amidst brown
As I swim in sound
To you, I’m just fucking around
But while the outside world is grey
My soul replays symphonies
I grab at them and squeeze a mountain
For you and me

A wondrous time was had by all concerned
(you know it too, don’t you? know it)
The candle has died, both ends have been burned away
The friends that you keep love you as you are
Day ends and you sleep, your lover in your arms
If you know it
Why don’t you show it now?

What’s wrong with you?
Don’t bother me
My heart’s abreeze
Treating myself like a precious object
Will make me

[Verse 1: Quaro]
Everybody've got a dream to pursue 'til death
Travelling light years without moving a step
And I've got lots of dreams as well
But the only thing I see coming true is ""nightmares""
Man vs Man doing all they can to push the other down again
Rich 10%, rich Uncle Sam, since ""the ages of ages"". Amen
Rich media lords reaching ears through the years
You should've never bought those TVs
Minds are easy, tricked 'cuz they need to see just things that are pleasing them
So they just bend your reality
Distract the audience, kill the rabbit
Rinse, repeat, until it's a habit
Weave webs, pull the wire and cut it
And I feel like I have strings on my arms
On my eyes shady lens block the sight on my target
I don't wanna play ""who's the hardest""
But have a seat in my head and try to get out then:
I don't have big issues, but you know our thoughts can enlarge any problem
And once they start going on and on and on
There is really no way to stop them
That's why silence is my anthem
And 'null' is my favourite object
In a world of cemetery closets, deserts of dust under our carpets
And I feel like I'm chased by Dementors
Turning my logic into nonsense
That's why I am not an MC
I'm just a pathetic mutter

[Verse 2: Quaro]
Closed in my room with sunshine outside
Trying to find a way to make it rhyme
And I discover what obscures my sight:
The fact that I don't want to see light when I'm down
I never took a challenge, never tried harder
Never played, too afraid of failing, this is madness
Always waiting for something to happen
Staring at the screen, not writing
Stuck because I just miss the point of it
I could just open the door and keep walking
Until I reach the peak of a mountain
Instead I cry about my life being void
But I never tried to make it matter
Architect of sand castles
Master procastinator
Chronic mutter

[Verse 1: Biggie Smalls]
Your reign on the top was short, like Leprechauns
As I crush so called Willies, Thugs & Rapper Dons
Get in that ass quick, fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon
(It's that rap phenomenon)

[Hook: Muppets + Biggie Smalls]
Doo doo, doo doo do
(Phenomenon)
Doo doo do doo
(Phenomenon!)
Doo doo dooo doo do, doo doo doo doo do doo doo doo doo doo!
*grunt*

[Verse 2: Biggie Smalls + Method Man]
(I got more Glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Nigga won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
In the head
Or motherfucker's dead
Irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon

[Hook: Muppets + Biggie Smalls]

[Outro: Statler & (Waldorf)]
(That was wonderful!) Bravo! (I loved it!) Ah, it was great!
(Well, it was pretty good.) Well, it wasn't bad
(Uh, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though) It could have been a lot better. (I didn't really like it.) It was pretty terrible
(It was bad.) It was awful! (It was terrible!) Take 'em away!
(Hey, boo!) Boo!

Oh Lord
You are the savior
The creator
You break the stones
My life
Erased and fallen
It controls me

My fault go away
My fault away
They break me down
What do I do?
Get out! And come on!
Get out! Come on!
You keep me moving

I was a waiter in North Baltimore
Down by the tracks and the video store where you worked
Three times a day you'd come in for a drink
I'd bring you a coffee, you'd pay with a wink and a smile

One day I saw you and pulled up a stool
I said, ""Kathy, I've known you since first grade in school on the bus""
You always had talked about seeing the world
I never imagined you'd still be the girl down the street

I asked, ""why are you still here?"", you just looked confused
You told me you can't get from here to Peru in a car
In Panama you'll hit the Darién Gap
There's suddenly nothing but white on the map and you're done...

You are done
You are done
You're done

We are one but not quite connected
We are one but light years apart
We are one but not quite connected
We are one oh oh

Now it's been so long since I wandered away
But I still think about what you told me that day in the bar
I wonder if you're still marooned with a globe
Waiting for someone to pave you a road to your dreams

"
115545,"

Let's pretend that this is real
Let's say this really is the deal
The way you put me out
It makes me doubt my sanity

Toe the line until it breaks
You savor all of your mistakes
And then you do whatever pleases you
It's all you know

Clean me and hang me out to dry
Screaming and live another lie
You make it seem so effortless

Grace is never the reward
It's a price you never could afford
You can count your change
But you can't exchange your dignity

Sell your soul and pay the rent
Be sure you count up every cent
Cause when you lose your aim
In this dirty game you're through

Clean me and hang me out to dry
Screaming and live another lie
You make it seem so effortless

Clean me and hang me out to dry
Scheming until the day you die
You make it seem so effortless

"
115546,"

The tiptoes on the bedroom floor
These quiet eyes are spinning in the dark
The secret wish that none will know
She keeps it locked up in her pale heart

Wait for it, it's tired and it's true
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She dreams in blue
She dreams in blue
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

The background hum of city streets
And whispers from the neighbors intertwine
The distant glow of beacon lights are
Breaking through the cracks between the blinds

Wait for it, it's hiding out of view
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She dreams in blue
She dreams in blue
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She opens up her weary eyes
The foggy cloud of vision fills the air
She strains to make some sense of all the
Abstract shapes and colors everywhere

But all the blue just fades away dissolving in a haze of grey
And lost inside her empty mind is everything she tried to find
And all the blue just fades away, she lost it in a haze of grey

She dreams in blue
She dreams in blue
Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

"
115547,"

I sat down
With a sharpened pencil in my hand
You were in my head and I had planned
To write you into verses and
Immortalize your virtues for a hundred years to come

And then I thought
About our tiny little history
You once had struck me as a mystery
Now I wonder what I used to see
And this empty page is screaming that
You're just like all the rest

Oh oh, oh oh, untitled
Oh oh, oh oh, untitled

You were real
Yeah, I swear I thought I knew you
But now my eyes just stare right through you
And I don't think I can blame you
Yeah, I saw what I was looking for, and pushed aside the rest

But I was wrong
No, it's not like you're an ogre
It's just you're bland and mediocre
I am drunk and you are sober yeah
This song won't ever write itself so you best be on your way

Oh oh, oh oh, untitled
Oh oh, oh oh, untitled

Easy come
It's not like art's some kind of charity
I guess a true muse is a rarity
The kind that gives your mind the clarity
To leave that empty page behind

Oh oh, oh oh, untitled
Oh oh, oh oh, untitled oh oh
I'm stuck without a spark of pain or joy
There's nothing, nothing
I'm stuck without a spark of pain or joy

"
115548,
115549,"

I don't wanna be in Findlay cause it goes to bed at nine
I don't wanna be in Bowling Green because it's plastered all the time
I don't wanna be in Lima cause there's nothing there to do
I just wanna spend some time with you

I don't wanna be in Cincy cause it smells like burning tires
I don't wanna be in Cleveland cause the lake'll catch on fire
I don't wanna be in Dayton not without a .22
I just wanna spend some time with you oh oh

Well it's so damn hard to find a reason
To stay in this infuriating place
But it's harder still to find a reason to leave oh oh

I don't wanna be in New York cause it's buried under crime
I don't wanna be in Portland where it's raining all the time
I don't wanna be in San Francisco in the early morning dew
I just wanna spend some time with you

I don't wanna be in London cause the skies are always grey
I don't wanna be in Paris cause I don't parles no francais
I don't wanna be in China with a horrifying flu
I just wanna spend some time with you oh oh

It's a rainy Sunday morning in Van Buren
The pious folks all scurry into church
We watch them trudge through the mud and sludge
I guess this place could be a whole lot worse

They say the grass is always greener
On the other side of the county line
But I'll just stay, brown grass is pretty anyway
Cause I just wanna spend some time with you
Spend some time with you

"
115550,"

Our colony
Is shining through the shaking of the artificial moon
The light of noon

Cut ragged glass
Kaleidoscope of soapy film refract the rays that pass
The blades of grass

Recite the words that you were taught

The face of man
You stare into the center as the colors bleed away
The dryest rain

You feel the same
The dirt beneath your saddle boots is snapping as you step
Into the scene

This life is just a fatal dream

Don't you ever worry about those dizzy spells you feel
That's just the taming of the ghosts
They can't hurt you, they'll desert you now

Take up your arms
The final day is here, you feel the ringing in your ears
Now disappear

The flaming sky
The rally of a lost July, the night precedes the lullaby
And takes away the last supply of day

"
115551,"

Aching bones and creaky homes and dust clouds on the street
Leaves are pinned by restless winds and fear
Premonition intuition trouble's near
Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here

The grinding fades from combine blades the tractor's hungry heart
At three o'clock the blackbird flock is gone
And no one knows why Jenna Rose just disappeared
But Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here

Train smoke flies and alibis are sinking in the wind
The little toys from little boys are gone
Silence fills the flour mills and streets are clear
Honcho Graham from Birmingham was/is here

Now every year there's less of here as nature chews it down
A town bereft and all that's left is rust
But any gent who's smelled the scent of solemn fear
Knows Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here
Honcho Graham from Birmingham was here

"
115552,"

The barometric pressure is increasing, but it's still below
The levels that we see in winter storms
We're up by thirteen millibars from where we were before
And it weakens as it moves in from the shore
(But Chad...)

Please, Carol, let me talk
Cuz I've got something to say, oh
Please, Carol, let me talk

Won't you let me do my job, I'm trying to explain
That once the pressure builds, the storm will fizzle out
I'm sorry if your feeble brain can't follow what I say
But I have dumbed it down as far as I will go

[Chorus]
It might not take a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
Or to tell you that it's sunny in Palm Springs
But that's not why I'm here, yeah, I went to school for years
So that I could tell you more about these things

[Chorus]

"
115553,"

I know you think she's sweet as candy
I know you wanna be with her
But Josie got a reputation
A scratch behind her purr

She's got her little game perfected
She'll let you think you have control
Then one day when you would least expect it
And steal away your soul

It's so easy when you think you're winning
But she's got herself another plan
You may think you're being clever like a modern man
But Josie has the upper hand

She's stubborn as a drunken donkey
She's subtle as a wrecking ball
She's spoiled like a bad banana
You're gonna slip and fall

She's denser than her diamond necklace
She's colder than a toilet seat
She's lazy as a dog on Sunday, but
You're the one who's on a leash

[Chorus]
I know you're not to blame
And there's no shame in falling for her siren
But while you're still a man
You better get out while you can

[Chorus x 2]

"
115554,"

I picked you up at ten to four
Just like a thousand times before
On a thousand other days

We took a walk in Silver Springs
I didn't even say a thing
Everything just disappeared

I was there the day the river went dry
And I just watched it flow away
I just stood and watched that river die
Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
You just hope for rain

You saw the dried-out river bed
You broke the silence and you said
Where did all that water go?

I didn't know, so I replied
It's just the nature of the tide
But you knew better

I was there the day the river went dry
And I just watched it flow away
I just stood and watched that river die
Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
You just hope for rain

I took you home, you said good night
I watched you fade into the light
Then you vanished through the door

My skin is dry as desert air
There's water, water everywhere
But I'm not thirsty

I was there the day the river went dry
And I just watched you flow away
I just stood and watched that river die
Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
You just hope for rain

And just hope for rain
And just hope for rain
And just hope for rain

Rotting driftwood on the foreign shores
Spilling out into the ocean floor
And the memory's all you left without a trace

Paralyzed with the thoughts receeding
The current sweeps you with its silent bleeding
Through the heart into the darkest place

Turn around, there's nothing to see here
Run away, no reason to be here
It's the ghost who never goes away

Turn around, and leave this behind now
See the ground as it bleeds into sky now
You fight the sea, you're always going to drown

All the secrets that you're holding
All the memories you hide
All the frail thoughts that echo in the corners of your mind

They won't even last a moment
The will soon be swept away
When the ocean takes you in its arms and carries you away

You carry all your burdens on the cross around your neck
You take whatever's left that you salvage from the wreck
And that haunted past will follow you like a lost dog on the beach
Nipping at your trail till you've drifted out of reach

Turn around, there's nothing to see here
Run away, no reason to be here
It's the ghost who never goes away

Turn around, and leave this behind now
See the ground as it bleeds into sky now
You fight the sea, you're always going to drown

The broken-line horizon and the castles made of sand
You tried to hold it in your hand, you tried to understand it

But the ocean asks the questions, and it holds the answers too
It dissolves away the lies about the things you thought you knew

Sweet little Cherry got her hands in her pockets
And she's waiting for a downtown train

High heel boots with the straps hung low
And her head hanging down in shame

The wolves all dress up just like sheep
And the go and hit the town
Cherry never sees 'em
But they're hanging all around

Sweet little Cherry got a switchblade Jimmy
Come and take her down to 4th and Main

Her mind in a haze of the better days
Before her body was an ad campaign

But now the filthy crooks and pocketbooks
Are all that Cherry sees
The dashboard dogs and backseat hogs and
Down onto her knees

I am tempted, I am weak
I'm too weak to try to speak
I am tempted, I'm ashamed
Yeah, I'm ashamed and I'm to blame

You'll see
Yeah I'm tempted by the cherry tree
You'll see
Yeah I'm tempted by the cherry tree

Sweet little Cherry took the last bus home
In the middle of the pouring rain

She saw the bad boys sleeping and the good girls weeping
Through the fog on the window panes

And Cherry wants to make it right
But she never has a prayer
Cuz as long as there are bad boys
They'll be penny millionaires

Jaws all drop at the candyshop when we walk in the store
It's a frightening display
Mothers hide their children's eyes and hurry toward the door
I don't even want to know the things that they will say

But they can't take our love away

We try to eat on Crawford Street on a summer afternoon
We're just met with cold dismay
The owner storms the table and he takes away my spoon, and says
""We're not some kind of new cafe
Where freaks like you are on display""

But he can't take our love away

Whoever said that love is blind, didn't understand mankind
What he really meant to say, was love can't see... shades of grey

The fat old boys in Washington, they like to kill our fun fun fun
Man, they sure don't like to play
They care more about the bedroom than they do about the boardroom
That's the price we gotta pay

But they can't take our love away

"
116265,"

We broke into the old Bay Shore Roller Rink
Through a hole in the back wall
The echoes of our sneakers amplified themselves like speakers
Through the corners of the long-forgotten hall

And the cobwebs spanned the door frames
As I kneeled down to spell your name
In the dust on the floor that we'd
Danced on so many times before

The musty aroma is filling my head
And the broken windows let the birds in
Our breath, it made clouds and they wrapped us like shrouds
To keep November from reaching our skin

And the ghost of the DJ floats in from the freeway
He puts on your favorite waltz
So I take your hand, the invisible band
Leads us dancing around in the hall

The glow from the sunset caught the big disco ball
And sent dusty rays of light into your face
And the light from the ball hit the frost on the walls
And sent oranges and reds into space

I caught a glance in the midst of our dance
For a moment I stopped in my tracks
The room was ablaze with the fiery rays
While the frozen air blew through the cracks

And our bodies are frozen in time

"
116266,"

The pawnbroker's stepdaughter
Fought away the cold December air

On a park bench sitting by a fallen pine
She folds her bloody hands and sees the sign

Saying
All we are we are we are is
All we are we are we are is sin
All we are we are we are is
All we are we are we are is sin

On the corner of North Main and High
The trains would shake the walls as they passed by

The clamor of the steel rails would
Drown her voice as she screamed in the night

A smile would cross his empty face
As he put that girl in her place again

She shut down her last defenses
She turned off her tattered senses
And looked up to the sky with glassy eyes

The pawnbroker's stepdaughter
Floats above the ground where she had stood
The pawnbroker's stepdaughter
Made it right the one way she could

She lift up her trembling hands
The room was spinning like a carousel

She felt her body spin around
With crimson running to the ground before her

The room turned silent, the train was gone
The melting snow, the the crack of dawn was here

This is how the story ends
The same way that it all begins
Cuz no one here forgives our sins on this world

The pawnbroker's stepdaughter
Floats above the ground where she had stood
The pawnbroker's stepdaughter
Made it right the one way she could

All we are we are we are is
All we are we are we are is sin
All we are we are we are is
All we are we are we are is sin
All we are we are we are is
All we are we are we are is
All we are is sin

There's a church on the corner of the street in my town
Where the blind lead the blind to salvation
They surrender their wills and the $10 bills to the sky

And it's one nation under god, indivisible
With liberty and justice for some
But the melting pot's only got soup if you follow the one

And they'll fill your bowl, if you save your soul

The spirit world is floating by
You will live and you will die
And no one knows exactly why
The spirit world's still fighting

Palestine lives in confusion
While Israel burns in the night
And they all want the same, just a place they can claim as their home

And they pray to the same god above them
Who is looking down on the destruction
How proud he must be of the death and debris and the blood that is shed in his honor

Chorus

When Allah spoke words to Muhammad
He delivered a message of peace
And it spread through the land but then died by the hands of a few

Now every brown man is feared as a killer
And he's got no idea why
He's just making a living and taking and giving and doing the best that he can

Chorus

There's a church on the corner of the street in my town
Where the blind lead the blind to salvation

The camera starts, the shower scene
I wield the knife, the girl screams
But she sounded like a wounded hen
The camera stops, we try again

Take nineteen, the shower scene
The cameraman got caught between between
The curtains, so he blew the take
The director says to take a break

The second break this afternoon
Her fingers look like shriveled prunes
She's screaming at the makeup man
To get the wrinkles off her hands

Why'd I go to school to act
There's noone here but freaks and hacks
These drama queens have got me down
I want to kill this whole damn town

I want to rule the silver screen
Not some B-list shower scene
With a plastic knife and sound effects
Like a porno flick without the sex

But I'll grin and bear this lousy film
And I'll play my stupid part until
I get my break and land a role
Where I don't need to puncture holes in bodies

"
116269,"

(formerly known as ""Spalding Gray is Missing"")

The flicker of the tv and a long forgotten memory
Are the only things you'll ever leave behind
The dust that's on the floor, there's noone at your door
Now tell me, do you really think you're free?
The war is done, my friend, you fought until the end
You threw your white flag down
Morning, noon and night, you always seemed to lose the fight
Spalding, where the hell are you?

You say that the grasses are greener and everything's cleaner on their shores
Today is the day where you're going to swim to cambodia

You once were lit ablaze with the fire of your younger days
You blinded everyone you met
You never were the same, since dublin's night consumed your flame
And stole the matches from your pocket
The hudson's freezing, but your braincells keep on squeezing 'round the
Thought that you must swim away today
From the staten island ferry on the coldest night in january
It's cambodia or bust

You once had feared the man who held you in his hand
And controlled you when you sleep
But now the end's your friend, you're reaching to extend
Your white flag to the sky you once had cursed
The sun is sinking and your frozen eyes are blinking
At the cold atlantic nothingness ahead
You take a deep sigh as you wave a passing goodbye
And you set your course and swim away

You say that the grasses are greener and everything's cleaner on their shores
Today is the day where you're going to swim to cambodia

They caught me back in '85
When they dropped a net down from the sky
In the jungle, I was so alive
Now I just survive

Twelve monkeys in this cell with me
Eight of them are family
I fathered them in captivity
Prisoners from the start

Smeared glass cage
As we spend our days on stage
And it's all they'll know

Nylon ropes and plastic slides
A concrete world for abstract minds
It's all controlled by man's designs
Nothing here is real

And we're all just keeping busy
In this everlasting zoo
And we're all just killing time
Because there's nothing else to do

[Chorus]
I see, the life that used to be
The dancing of the leaves
As I'm swinging through the trees and I am
Searching, for a place to pay my head
The forest is my bed
Till the ring a bell to feed us
And they flash a light to lead us, in this

[Chorus]

"
116271,"

Hey ruth
I don't mean to listen in, but these walls are paper thin, you know
Hey ruth
I heard the fighting last night, he doesn't treat you right at all

So maybe you don't even know my name
Just open your eyes and i know you would feel the same way

Hey ruth
The truth isn't always clear, it's hard to see when you're so near
Hey ruth
He wants to suck you dry, you're out of luck, too blind to see

The way that he treats you is a crime
Don't let him hold you back this time, no no no

I know that you probably can't read my mind
But why is it so hard to leave him behind now

Hey ruth
We all want to leave this highrise, move onto bluer skies, i know
So turn off that tv set
And get on your feet again, remember the times when you were free

"
116272,"

Anna Minster, it's sure been awhile
I heard through the grapevine that you took a walk down the aisle

So it's true then, oh yeah, I remember him
From grade 9 geometry, his glasses had tape on the rim

So now you're a housewife, with a place in Lake Cascades
And you're husband's an architect, it sounds like you've really got it made

Is that your daughter, in that picture, she got your pretty eyes of blue
She got your crescent-moon smile, and that curly blonde hair just like you

No me, I'm not married, at least not anymore
I couldn't pay all of her bills from the factory floor

I spent time in the Army, they taught me how to fight
Until I came to my senses and saw that it just wasn't right

That's alright though, I've got a dog and a bungalo
I can sit on my porch and just watch the old sycamore grow

Well thanks for coming, but now it's time for me to go
I wish you the best for another 10 years down the road

"
116273,"

The sun is hanging low on the skyline
On this sleepy old Ohio town
The people think that change is the devil
So the sun is not allowed to go down

And the drivers eyes are glued to the rearview
Cuz his car is always in reverse
And if you race to where you've already been, then
You are always gonna get there first

Welcome to the town of the sundown
Welcome to the town of the sundown
Welcome to the land that time forgot
Welcome to the town of the sundown
Welcome to the town of the sundown
It sure ain't much, but it's the only town I've got

Every time I open the paper
To the letters to the editor page
The trogolodytes who can't keep their mouths shut
They've really got me in a fumin' rage

This self-appointed king of the virtues
Trying to sell us what we threw away
He's a dumpster-diving prophet
He could rule the USA

Welcome to the town of the sundown
Welcome to the town of the sundown
Welcome to the land that time forgot
Welcome to the town of the sundown
Welcome to the town of the sundown
It sure ain't much, but it's the only town I've got

So this is what our children inherit
It's what our parents left behind for us
The trophies from our grandpa's old basement
With a thicker coat of rust and dust

I guess there's nothing left to discover
So let's just park our cars and rest
Cuz the mission here's accomplished
Don't it feel like a success?

"
116274,
116275,"

Pack your bags and leave this town
I don't wanna see you coming round
No, I don't wanna waste my precious time again

With a Star Trek sticker on your Cadillac
I don't wanna see you coming back
No, I don't wanna see your gloomy face again

Waiting takes more time than letting go

Sitting at a stop sign wasting time
When I'd rather be speeing on the 99
This relationship just won't shift out of neutral

You say that you'll be ready soon
I've already heard that tune
And I don't think you're ready for a new role

Waiting takes more time than letting go
Waiting takes more time than letting go

Take your car or hop a train
Call a cab or fly a plane
I'm sick of waiting in this intersection

Waiting takes time and I ain't got it
Got my shirt all buttoned and my shoes all knotted
And I gotta start moving in some vague direction

Waiting takes more time than letting go
Waiting takes more time than letting go

Go away, and get your foot off of my brakes

Enjoy

[Verse 1]
It’s a small town, it doesn’t ask for much
Broken down and always building back up
Something small
Something to shine the lights on
For those passing cars
The hopeful words they’ve drawn

[Verse 2]
He’s a young man, light load on his chest
Single again
He follows a dream to the west
To a town nearby, a hand on his back
And her haunting eyes
And a clear voice whispering

[Hook]
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it

[Verse 3]
You stoke the fire, holding onto the light
Folding the layers and bending them in to shape
With a pounding iron
A heat that draws the moths out
From their holding walls
To your humble home they come

[Hook]
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it
It’s all laid out in front for you to take it

[Outro]
It’s a small town, it doesn’t ask for much

"
116884,"

[Chorus]
From that cold November I’ve learned so much more
Don’t you see, she wears a diamond ring
But I kinda like the river low
Soft and low

In my memories I’m silent
In my daydreams I am bold
I leave tender notes and markings where I go
And I’ve never been pretending
It's the evenings when I lie
I’ve been silently admiring
The simple way she wears her hair

If it's a question of my loyalty
You never have to worry
I’ll be with you wherever you may go

There’s a calmness in my footsteps
In the new lines of my hands
There are portraits on the wall that need explaining

And the evenings are quiet
When I’ve finally broken through
Getting color in the nighttime
When it's not that way

If it's a question of my loyalty
You never have to worry
I’ll be with you wherever you may go
Sitting safely in your memory
Easy for you to carry
Take me with you wherever you may go

[Chorus]
From that cold November I’ve learned so much more
Don’t you see, they wear diamond rings
But I kinda like the river low
Soft and low

"
116885,"

Easy Ursa
Don’t stir don’t fright
We are only passing through here
In the waning autumn light

Under your stars
Your earthless movement
Pawing fruitless through barren heavens

Easy, easy
Resting with her
Moments given unto the ether

Lay down your claim
Your labored motion
Fall into her
In warm collision

Under your stars
Your earthless movement
We are only
Feeble humans


On and on
And over and over and over

Paso por tantos lugares
Que no recuerdo más
A quién quedo esperando
Para verla volver
Pasaron tantos días
Que ya no cuenta más
La chica que creció un día
Hoy ya no espera más
Golondrina
Déjame saber de ti
Golondrina
Quiero parecerme a ti
Golondrina
Sola me iré volando
Golondrina
Va adonde ti cami... llanto
Golondrina
Déjame saber de ti
Golondrina
Quiero parecerme a ti
Golondrina
Sola me iré volando
Golondrina
Va adonde ti cami... llanto
Todo lo que dejó
Hoy no existe más
Esperando pasar un año para verlo volver
Vuela, vuela golondrina
Allá hay otros esperando
Esperando para verte, intentando entenderte
Golondrina
Déjame saber de ti
Golondrina
Quiero parecerme a ti
Golondrina
Sola me iré volando
Golondrina
Va adonde ti cami... llanto

Am i hanging on to something that isn't real?

I'm trying to stop
I'm thinking about you
But i just can't help the way you feel
Why you gotta make me feel like i am some kind of stranger?
Girl you know I've known you for ten years
Since we were both little teenagers
Wanna spill into your life again
How can I ever fight again
Show me
Show me something real

When i'm in the same room with you
My feet don't touch the ground
Don't mean to be so selfish
But I hope there's not another boy you found

I'm plugged into the wall
Unplug me and I fall into your eyes
I wish i hadn't left you
But I left you now my life is [child?]

Wanna spill into your life again
I can never fight again
Give me
Give me something real

Show me
Show me something real

Wanna spill into your life again
I can't ever fight again
Give me
Give me something real
Show me
Show me something real
Show me
Show me something real

Girl when you walked in through the back door
Really got me going
I just don't know if i can give it all
That's worth not knowing

I sure didn't know what i didn't want to stay at all
I just had to think when you started to drink i know

Don't let me break your heart again
Don't let me bring your heart again
We've been here a million times before
Something bout you that i can't ignore

Yes it gets easier to pretend
We don't know what we're doing
It's saying i know it's easier
To send we both end up losing
I sure don't know what you're baby is staying back home
I shouldn't try to mind cause i'm wasting your time but you know

Don't let me break your heart again
Don't let me break your heart again
We've been here a million times before
Something about you that I can't ignore
Always play into each other's games
Chasing memories never feels the same

You crawled in my head
And I've got my doubts
It's never been the same
Couldn't get you out
Wanted me to stay but i'm not in way well I know
Want to go again nothing's ever the same well i know

We've been here a million times before
Something about you that I can't ignore
Don't let me break your heart again
Don't let me break your heart again

[Verse 1]
I got a problem that I can't deal with
All I want to do is take a sip
I need a [?] to keep me going
All my friends, they don't know that

I can't, can't eat on an empty stomach
I'll keep on going until they pumping
I'm sorry friends I didn't mean to
Take it back, I don't need you

[Chorus]
I've got a problem that I don't like
I need my friends to help me fight
Please don't tell me to do it then
I could use your help a bit

[Verse 2]
Every time I dream in my sleep
I get the dream but I am so clean
Then I wake up in the morning
And I realize the dream is [?]

And I can't, can't remember what I'm thinking
I try my mind and it is sinking
To the bottom of the goddamn ocean
Please my friends, lend me an emotion

[Chorus]

[Outro] [2x]
I'm so full of this empty feeling
Everyday I sit there grieving
And my hate, yet no reason
Every season feels like the rapture

[Verse 1]
Where are you son?
You are the only one
Who can keep us happy
I'm never gonna take, the clouds are here to stay
Raindrops fall from Sally

[Chorus]
I want to see you, i'm longing to feel
But I can't blow these clouds away
Would you? I miss you
I wish I could fix you
Please just blow these clouds away

[Verse 2]
Finishing December and I still can't remember
Last time that you chose your face
Everything is dead but the thoughts are in my head
If it could turn it gray

[Chorus]
I want to see you, i'm longing to feel you
But I can't blow these clouds away
Would you? I miss you
I wish I could fix you
Please just blow these clouds away

[Chorus]
I want you, I miss you
I wish I could fix you
Please just blow these clouds away

[Verse 1]
You've got all of these rules
And I wanna bend 'em
You ain't got nothing to lose
Neither do I

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, the way I want you
Cause I can't have you
The way I want to

[Verse 2]
You've got all of these rules
And I wanna bend 'em
You ain't got nothing to prove
Neither do I

Girl, it's so obvious
We belong together
Why are we draggin' this out?
I don't wanna wait forever

[Chorus X2]

[Verse 3]
You've got all of these rules
And I wanna bend 'em
You ain't got nothing to lose
Neither do I
So many times I've tried
Tried to meet the faces
Geez, now I'm looking for love in all of the wrong places

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, the way I want you
Cause I can't have you, the way I want to
It ain't easy, the way I want you
Cause I can't have you, the way I want t

Run and hide
Run and hide
Stay alive
You run and hide

White cold riot
White cold riot
All my might
White cold riot

Can't explain
Won't explain
In the rain
Can't explain

Simple mind
Intertwined
Simple mind
Is now mine

Raining fire
Raining fire
Screaming why
Raining fire

Look outside
Look outside
Wonder why
Look outside

Good:
While it is true that night time devours the day
It is doubly true that every morning, the sun returns to frighten away the cowardly darknesss
Darkness has no power here, ""be gone!""

Evil:
Haha, we shall soon see who has the power in the universe
Enough talking, I grow impatient with your idle words
It is time to fight

Good:
I would prefer not to engage in violence but I see now it is the only language you will understand
So, we will fight!

"
118650,"

[Verse 1]
I rush fast
Like the rapid river
A rough and heavy
Steady flow

The rocks stop me
For a moment
But I weave above
And bend below

I eat what is fed me
I can cause a deadly blow

[Chorus]
Still the river flows
And only heaven knows
Where the to is fro
Where the rivers flow

[Verse 2]
Valley to valley
Rough to rough
I don't know
When enoughs enough

Over the mountain
Up to the heavens
I follow the current
Of the river's flow
Of the river's flow

[Verse 3]
Here we go now
Heed the river
Now we know we gotta
Heed the flow

Here we go now
Heed the moment
When you toss and turn below

Here we go now
Heed the current
The river shines
With a dangerous glow

[Chorus]
Still the river flows
And only heaven knows
Where the to is fro
Where the rivers flow

Up from a spring
Down from the rain
No matter what
I will still remain

From the beginning
Right to the end
I follow the flow
Of the river's bend
Of the river's bend

"
118651,"

[Verse 1]
All the world's wretched words
You're rest assured that I have heard
In smokey skies and infant cries
All of my lies fly high in pride

Fortune and fortune
And gold and gold
I'm told I'll get my fortune and gold

But I feel cold and left alone
To sit idly by my graveyard stone

[Pre-Chorus]
All my thoughts
Turn into oughts
Could of beens
Should of beens
Whether I'm free or not

All my sadness
Banished, it's madness!
It's vanished and never coming back

[Chorus]
My face to the floor
Heart racing no more
These lungs I adore
Have rot to the core

In my last weakened swallow
My heart becomes hallowed
As the lands in my mind become fallow

[Verse 2]
All the dark and dreary nights
I stand alone in terror and fright

Crying out my pain and fear
Into the silence I hold dear
The breeze, the breath of God - is still
And kills my cold and frozen shrill

Soft yet broken my body free falls
Though shattered glass and haunting halls

[Pre-Chorus]
All my thoughts
Turn into oughts
Could of beens
Should of beens
Whether I'm free or not

All my sadness
Banished, it's madness!
It's vanished and never coming back

[Chorus]
My face to the floor
Heart racing no more
These lungs I adore
Have rot to the core

In my last weakened swallow
My heart becomes hallowed
As the lands in my mind become fallow

[Verse 3]
Soon the end will come to pass
The future and present give way to past

You'll leave this cold and fragile world
To dance upon the starlit whirl of
Truth becomes irrational
And love becomes love actual

You try to react in time for action
But the fever has grown and killed your sorry soul

"
118652,"

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go I
Stroll around and to the side
Every so often I might
Fall over to the left and the right
I never could hold on
No matter how hard i try
Stumble
Tumble
Fumble
Ahhh
Maybe next week
Maybe next month

Now I know I'm no Picasso
But I feel like a blue soul
Face twisted and my wrists sore
From when i fell down a stairwell
Hell let's try and make a combo
Face first then the legs will follow
Crashing
Bashing
Lashing
Ahh
Maybe next time
After the next wine

[Chorus]
One drink for my trouble
Two drinks for my love
Three drinks to blind my pain
And then another one for my wobble
Now I'm wollowing and morbidly formed
I can say for sure i'm scorned
Now I'm
Walking
Right home to my bed
To try to dream it all away

[Verse 2]
I don't know how I can even keep it going
Screaming every night into the morning
Wake up early and start my groaning
My bodies freezing as it starts snowing
The midwest ain't the best for a night's rest
When your falling on your face and you break your chest
Wild
Child
Trying to survive
But the winter ain't mild

You might say that you're pushing yourself down
And your the only man standing in your way
Then you'd prolly say your drinking till your drowned
Don't you know it's your body that will pay
And I could say that your crazy and a liar too
But in the back of my mind i'd know the truth
I've had it
Fanatic
I'm basically an addict
Pulling apart my heart
It's problematic

[Chorus]
One drink for my trouble
Two drinks for my love
Three drinks to blind my pain
And then another one for my wobble
Now I'm wollowing and morbidly formed
I can say for sure i'm scorned
Now i'm
Walking
Right home to my bed
To try to dream it all away

Well I couldn't say live or die
I can only say that'll i try
Well I could say life or death
But I know it'd be a wasted breath
Deep in my blood
Bleeding out through love
All my problems flash into a flood
One more bartender
One more please
I got a whole lot of pain to drink out of me

[Intro, Spoken Word by Alan Watts]
And so there came a point in our evolution when we didn't guide life by just trusting our instincts and had to think about it and had to purposefully arrange and discipline and push our lives around in accordance with foresight and words and systems of symbols, accountancy, calculation and so on. And then we worry. Once you start thinking about things, you worry as to if you've thought enough.....


[Verse 1]
Grab ahold
Grab ahold
Take my hand and follow me

Where we're going
Where we're going
There are things for the eye to see

When we're over there
You'll feel it all around

Let it all come through
All the love for you

There ain't a thing
There ain't a thing
There ain't a thing that will frighten you

Theres peace of mind
Theres peace of mind
Flooding all over you

When you whistle loud
The clouds whisp into sound

Over and around
It shakes all of the proud

[Chorus]
Don't you wanna seperate your
Body from your mind
Don't you wanna dance with the devil
To see what you can find

Don't you wanna feel the thunder
Deep in your waking slumber
Don't you want to wake up knowing
Where you do belong

[Verse 2]
It's powerful!
The voice of love
The voices of your brothers

We're bound to fall
But most of all
We all get back up together

Have mercy lord
My entire world
Lord have mercy
My mind is thirsty

Come along
Come along
Come along and follow me

The light of day
The dark of night
Will oscilate all throughout your life

When you don't divide
Then you will be fine

But if you don't abide
You'll be pushed aside

Apropos, it's time to go
Come along and don't say goodbye

Open wide
Open up your mind
Let all of your spirit flow

Now your gunna find
Peace flood through your mind

Breathe all of it in
And burn right through your skin
Right through your skin

[Chorus]
Don't you wanna seperate your
Body from your mind
Don't you wanna dance with the devil
To see what you can find

Don't you wanna feel the thunder
Deep in your waking slumber
Don't you want to wake up knowing
Where you do belong

[Verse 2
Everybody loves a rocket mon
I said everybody loves da mon
Everybody watches de rocket mon
When he floats into outer space

Jet into outerspace rocket mon
Ooh rocket mon

Use your jetpack rocket mon
Blast your troubles away

Ohh you get so high
In your rocket rocket mon

Ooh everybody loves that rocket mon
When he waves at us from up der

It's like he has no worries
Not even a single care

[Chorus]
Oh, rocket mon
Oh, rocket mon

Oh, everybody loves the rocket mon
Oh, everybody loves the mon
Oh, rocket mon
Oh, rocket mon

Oh, everybody loves the rocket mon
Oh, everybody loves the mon

[Verse 2]
Now you know about da rocket mon
Snd how he flies so high

But too bad for you
He has to go away to a distant world

This is the end of the rocket mon song
Bye bye rocket mon
Good flying to you

I hope you meet some rocket women
In outer space

[Verse 1]
I went down to Chicago
I didn't know where else to go
I was paid to shoot a man
I just shot him and then I ran

I didn't even get the money I'm owed
I turned around and took to the road
I've been wandering to and fro
And made my way to Chicago

I see the fire of the barrel
And bullet fly like an arrow
I see the trouble in the poor man's eyes
I see his soul take to the skies

[Chorus]
Gone away
Yeah, I'm gone away
Yeah, I'm gone away
Oh, I'm gone away
Yeah, I'm gone away
Yeah, I'm gone away
Oooh

[Verse 2]
I got a hole in my heart now
My stomachs churning and I'm broken down
I keep crying and there ain't no end
I can try but i'd fail again

Because there ain't no action
In this world

"
118657,"

[Verse 1]
Hey man on the left
Man on the right
Man, it's a matter of the middle

Take a good look
Take a side step
Wake your brain up to the riddle

All of your mind
Both of your ears
Take a hard listen to all the revel
Revel revel revel
Revolution

Floating in the sky
Wondering why
Shooting down electric lightning

And up from above
Were gods of love
Telling me that life ain't fearful

They're telling me son
Walk don't run
You gotta whole lot of loving going on
Yeah, Yeah
You gotta whole lot of loving going on

[Chorus]
Take a deep breath
Listen to the past
Tryna be the best
Like ever last

Forget the rest
They're anybody's guest
[?] the test
Live fast

[Verse 2]
My dear son
I'm the god of love
Made from the righteous power
On the most righteous hour

Let me hear your reaction son
Sing loudly, proudly
So loud it's astounding

Fire
War
Make it
No more

Hate fate
Just wait
It ain't
Too late

Love
Only grows
Oh this i know

Listen
What your missing
You got to be free, yea
Be free, yea
Be free, yea
Be free, yea
Be free, yea
Be free

Free free
You gotta be free
You gotta be free
To feel real freedom

Listen to me brother
I went to the heavens and back
So I know for a fact
That your fear
Isn't a factor
It won't effect ya
If you reflect on
All of your lovin and your grooving
Cause when your body gets a moving
Then your mind will start tuning
The the rhythm of the funk

"
118658,"

The dust in the wind
Carry weight of the sins
Of your father and his kin
Since the world did begin

The ease in the breeze
Had them begging on their knees
It bended all the trees
And flash freezed all reprise

[Chorus x4]
No home
No home
No home

Wait till the fires stop burning
And the choir starts murmuring
""The darkness has swallowed your home""

For the time upon you now
And the crimes our spirit found
Will surely reap your soul

Won't you stay with me
Just one last night
Let us just pretend
Cause it won't be easy outside

Won't you stay with me
Time is all we've got
All the tears are shed
It won't leave a trace at all

Passing by
Nothing's right
Passing by
Nothing's right

Let us walk away
Dawn has had its run
It is warm and dry
And the ending has begun

Passing by
Nothing's right
Passing by
Nothing's right

I could sing you a song about the last five seconds of love
I could sing you a song about the last five seconds of love
I'm so shy
I left the morning after a key disaster
At the evening affair
Within the first five minutes alone
At the evening affair
Within the first five minutes alone
I was so tongue-tied
I gave the wrong impression of the wrong suggestion
Graduation day
Graduation day
You'd think by now I'd learn to stay away
You're the friend of a friend
That's the last I ever heard
Why do I try?
I stated my defenses from 1 to 99
I'd like to sing you a song about the last five seconds of love
I'd like to sing you a song about the last five seconds of love
With the sun in my eyes
I made a full confession
I learned my lesson well
Graduation day
Graduation day
Oh you'd think by now I'd learn
Don't you think by now I'd learn to stay away?
Graduation day
Day

Everybody lies
Everybody's lied to
Everybody learns to get what they want
Why should I be different?
Why should I?

Lies come back to laugh at your insides
Why should I be different?
I'd like to know

I know what you'll say
I know what you'll say
I know just what you'll say
Before you speak a word

Straight lines
Single file
One way right
Everyday
So why do I stay when the word is so big?
And I know what you'll say
I know just what you'll say
Before you speak the words

Whisper to me
Whisper to me
I miss your voice on the line
Talking to me
Sing sing sing sing
Once in a while

Everybody lies
Why shouldn't we?

Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
Ever stare at the soft and cruel?
Like how the raindrops feel to the swimming pool?
Thousand souls are left to breathe
A thousand souls that never need
Twist twist twist the phone
Voices down an empty home
Ever been in my living room
Alone and sold the spoon
Does it move you when I (?) alone
Let’s leave from human bones
I hear you calling
Although your mouth is toast
It breaks my beef with foes and
Blows right through me
Blows right through me
Blows right through
Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
At all, at all at all at all
At all, at all at all at all

You know I’ll always be honest
In everything that I do
You know I’ll always be honest
I’ll always be honest with you, it’s true
I will always be honest with you

You know I’d do what I promised
You know I will do what is true
You know I’d do what I promised
Cos I’ll always be honest with you, it’s true
I will always be honest with you

There’s nights I’ve been filled with sorrow
Your heart might still feel so blue

I’ll be back with you again in the world tomorrow
I’ll be back with you again in the world
I’ll be back with you again in the world tomorrow
I’ll be back with you again in the world

I see her standing out in the dark waiting for a call
There is a chance for us to head inside and enjoy the rest of the night
I try to calm her down in my sleep, I see myself inside a lucid dream
What a life to live, what an honest lie to choose for this day

There is a place where you always go because you need to hide
You think it’s normal to escape yourself, tell me how it’s done
I try to calm her down in my sleep, I see myself inside a lucid dream
What a life to live, what an honest lie to choose for this day

From what I see we better call it quits
I just need to pretend that we are all the same
I just need to pretend that we are all the same

Just said it all afraid

Standing with you on a corner
It's getting too late to recall
It started out, the memories fade

Just tell me where it hurts
Just tell me where it hurts
Just tell me where it hurts
I've made my mind up
Made my mind up

[Verse 2]
Found my place in the morning
Just tell me when are you around
Gotta take to future in the pain
Sorry I can't feel the wind blow
Sorry I can't see the end
It's over now, this could be the end

Just tell me where it hurts
Just tell me where it hurts

Say, announce to the world
It's like the day you ruined everything we knew
Inside, just wasting away
Sitting pretty, just [?]

Someday, find a way, to walk and go outside

It's so easy, running [?] in my head

Say, getting tired of dreaming
Build a filter on everything I know
It's fun, [?]
It's just a matter of time before I go

It's so easy, running [?] in my head

Driving upstate on the useless stairs of being all in control
Turning my back upon my gas with myself i fight the road
Yes going down this road bitter cold with grey lights close me down
Spending my days with the dues i take as long as i
God i need some control
Yes i need some control
I need some control
Going slow
Moving slow
Way back down in the rainy town where i see that something is wrong
Going the road with desperate no when it's there for far too long
Now rocking the shook no shields to her clothes when her waist go around
She goes down and spins around for reason
God i need some control
Yes i need some control
I need some control
Going slow
Moving slow
There’s a place where the famous trace i was even there at all
Twisting around to fix my spine in a cloud  i can’t recall
I’ve been stuck in the bed feeling every well of nerves of brought you down
Finding a way of the  thoughts i’ve made is cloud enough

Hold on and find the, [?] walking back
[?] and go down the path alone
Take the sky over landslides, this is only more
And I fall to pieces to fend for, to see it burn

[Verse 3]
Walk the city alone
Walk the city alone
Take the pain back
Fuck the pain, let it go

[Verse 4]
Fell a thousand one
Fell a thousand one
Find the pieces yourself
Find the places to sell

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse:]
Get up off your back
It's a vision of a future where it catapults of mine for me it will feel
This is not your faith with the music that surrounds you take control
And feel the crystal away
This is what i’ve got
This is what i’m looking for
Just please be all around
Be all around
Just please be all around
Be all around
Circle back around
In this endlessly it's going around and easy is the chance to take you down
It's just a stage remember where we’re coming from because you'll be there again
Until you go
This is what i’ve got
This is what i’m looking for
Just please be all around
Be all around
Please be all around
Be all around
This is what i’ve got
This is what i’m looking for
Just please be all around
Be all around
Yeah please be all around
Be all around
Just please be all around
Be all around
Yeah please be all around
Be all around

[Verse 1]
I want to go back to that perfect day
Where the rays streamed in on me
Take me back to that perfect day
With the stairs beneath my feet

[Verse 2]
The world was mine, I hadn't a care
I felt fine, everything was clear
Light cast shadows on this perfect day
The air was sweet with spring

[Verse 3]
Dust drifted down on this perfect day
And the colors formed around
The world was mine, I hadn't a care
I felt fine, everything was clear

[Verse 4]
I felt the carpet between my toes
My hand braced on a sill
Leaning forward I peered out
But I got a sudden chill

[Bridge]
The corner caved in, I lost control
There is no time to save my soul

[Verse 5]
I looked down and the floor was gray
The walls were clean and white
A brilliant sound outside filled the air
But something around me felt so tight

[Bridge]
The corner caved in, I lost control
There is no time to save my soul

The corner caved in, I lost control
There is no time to save my soul

[Outro]
Please bring me back to that perfect day
I haven't the strength to beg
Soon they're about to close the door
Sending my regards from the cell born boy

[Verse 1]
I'm sick of you hangin’ around
I'm sick of lies spread all over town
This time you went too far
Now I know who you really are

[Chorus]
You're the chick who’d mess with my head
Ancient one who recently said
""Yeah I know we should hang out
Yeah, for sure, without a doubt""

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of all the things that you say
You can take your dog and just walk away
Here and there, with all your great plans
Up and down, I know where you stand

[Chorus]
You're the chick who'd mess with my head
Ancient one who recently said
""Yeah I know we should hang out
Yeah, for sure, without a doubt""

You’re already lost
In manners of information
Because you were to meet up with the strep throat dispenser On the stairs at the union
Across from the Anti-Muslim/Anti-Queer/Anti-Youth demonstration

Those dreams you’re having work to hide the game you play
Where the player can choose but cannot win
They are the posted missals pointing to the broken hymn
You are a busted bag that dribbles spittle in my bin

Anyway
The black-haired, blackfaced rapper
Wound up being nothing but an actor while
The blonde-haired, brownfaced rapper found him hanging from the rafters
Standing in the middle of it all
The Colonel Count Fanshawe
The main man Jeremiah
And in the back, Ryan and Ashley drawing out their tangerine dream

Out and walking
My head is dead
And you’re skipping ship-shape down the one-way street
You are tripping out
Down the way of the Anti-Tobacco/Anti-Bully/Anti-Nuclear demonstration
On the side of the Anti-Petrol/Anti-Money/Anti-Discipline signs
That’s when I knew I had myself to blame for this faceless, fearless, Count Basie-raping sea change

And what’s worse
They had already assigned two lieutenants to the scene
Where you had lost more than your car, your pants, your wallet, your phone
Which to Ryan and Ashley was already known in their tangerine dream

This had all first seemed ridiculous to me because I remember being at his house, for sure
I remember doing things at his house, for sure
I checked my emails before and then we walked to the shore. We had eaten dinner together, we had talked together, and during that time I hadn’t left his apartment together—but—they were insisting on putting everything into hourly segments like Ryan and Ashley once seen when they told me about their tangerine dream
And they insisted that I had left the apartment for a certain period of time to meet somebody, which frankly I didn’t remember but the interpreter said I probably had a tangerine dream

Anyway
The black-haired, blackfaced rapper wound up being nothing but an actor
While the blonde-haired, brownfaced raptor
Found him hanging from the rafters
Standing in the middle of it all, the Colonel Count Fanshawe
With my main man Jeremiah
And in the back
Ryan and Ashley drawing out their tangerine dream for all to be seen in a dream

A: How did you come to decide to delete the message?
B: I had a limited amount of space on my phone, and whenever I received a message that I didn’t need to remember something for, I deleted it
A: So why didn’t you delete yours when you answered his?
B: Um, I’m not used to deleting those. I just delete the ones that I’ve seen in my tangerine dream

I would like to taste your flesh
You look so pretty and fresh!
You’re my precious whore
Pretty little princess
So dirty, you’re making me obsess…
So sweet, so tender…
And such an innocent consenter!
I see you,violent and bruised
I know you like to be abused

You call yourself my friend
Yet on you I can’t depend!
You made me believe…
How could I be so naive?
Shut up, don’t lie
Leave me alone, and die!
Don’t talk to me
I cannot stand your voice
Just leave me be
You’ve shown you’ve made your choice
I fucked myself for you
Did you get what you wanted to?
You call yourself my friend
Yet on you I can’t depend!

Help me!..
I stretch my hand to reach
To reach onto you
But you dispised me
My cry oblivious to
I needed just a hand
To make me well again
You turned your back on me…
You turned on me!
If you won’t help me
Just leave me the hell alone
If you can’t help me
Leave me, I’ll fare on my own
I’ve lost my will, I’ve lost my might
I’ve lost the fray, I’ve lost the fight
I grow impatient
Disgusted by life and way
I try again again to breed
To breed a new strength
I try again to breathe
To breathe the air I need
Help me!..

I wake from sleep, sweating
All my world in turmoil
I look around, finding myself
For a brief minute I am lost…
This hands that lunge at me
I see them so clearly
Holding on to my throat…
I succumb, gasping for air!
Rise, I rise…
From among the ashes, I rise…
The dirt I’m buried in, I rise!!
I wonder why, is this a sign
Is anybody out to get me
I try to see, I try to think…
I see nothing, I see no reason
Why these nightmares grab hold on me
This terror which
This fear that haunts my sleep
I see nothing…Nothing
Am I my own enemy?
Am I the one going against myself?
Holding myself down, suffocating…
Stopping my own breath?
I wake from sleep, sweating
All my world in turmoil
I look around, finding myself
For a brief minute I am lost…
This hands that lunge at me
I see them so clearly
Holding on to my throat…
I succumb, gasping for air!
Rise, I rise…
From among the ashes, I rise…
The dirt I’m buried in, I rise!!

"
122769,"

My days have turned to grey
Somewhere, somehow, I’ve gonne astray
Each time I wake up I wonder
Why the hell I’m torn assunder
The hours pass, the clock is ticking
I look around, no point in tricking myself
Into thinking there is something else
I search for a way to unexist
And see with dead eyes a way to unexist
I scrape and dig, inside is nothing
I’m just a whirlwhind, and I’m stuck spinning
I need no enemy
I break my own way
I loose myself in my poisonous embrace
I can look into my own eyes
And see no sparkle, no point in moving on
Just a sickness, to which I am a pawn
This parasite stuck inside me
This hunger ever present

"
122770,"

Confined to an endless dome of black light
Where we are bitten by the halo of war
And hide from the hounds of hypocrisy!

Lash upon lash
Mankind severes it’s own back!
Lash upon lash
Affection which the mind neglects!

Diminished into the smaller life forms
Despised by the warlords of a new Era
Chaosphere of the Rotting Age!

I've got a lovesick tale to tell to you
Though it ain't no affair of mine
It's 'bout a gal named Sue and a boy named Lou
They were fighting all the time
Sue came home one afternoon
And found an empty dining room
Without a word her turtledove had flown
She began to moan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when, he didn't say why
Oh, bid me goodbye
I'm blue as I can be I know he loved another one but he didn't say who
He didn't say when, he didn't say what
His mama has got
That took my sweetie from me
I'm like a little lost sheep
And I can't sleep
But I keep trying to forget
My trifling papa has left his mama all alone, I groan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when, he didn't say why
I know I'll die
Why don't he hurry home

I heard someone's voice in the cold night
I heard someone's words. I can't find you
You are gone. Nobody feels sorry for you
You are gone. Nobody'll ever come

Holy God! I won't let you down
Holy God! Take my body now
Holy God! I won't let you down
Holy God! I wanna die right now

This time I'll begin with a cold heart
In clothing and skin of the same kind
You are gone. Nobody feels sorry for you
You are gone. Nobody'll ever come

Holy God! I won't let you down
Holy God! Take my body now
Holy God! I won't let you down
Holy God! I wanna die right now

I know what you need
I know, you deserve it
I know what you need
You're ruled by greed

Holy God! I won't let you down

Holy God! I won't let you down
Holy God! I wanna die right now

If you listen close, you might hear the sound
Well, I would never let you down
I thought you were a man of action
Come on baby, come on, give me a little reaction

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

[Verse 2]
Well, you keep telling me it won’t be long
Well, that’s not right and that’s not wrong
Come on, talk to me baby and don’t be so cold
Your kingdom comes from actions and not from being bold

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

My perception is growing dim
There’s no way to lose and no way to win
I’m not gonna stay down
Goodbye to dark days that surround

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

My perception is growing dim
There's no way to lose, no way to win
I'm not gonna stay down
Goodbye to dark days that surround

[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna waste your time
You keep talking to me, I might change my mind
There's colors that you can’t see
I wanna say to you so naturally

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna hang out with anyone else
So why you wanna hide behind yourself?

[Verse 2]
If you’re really Mother Nature’s son
Shining perpetual sound on everyone
Well, I don’t wanna let you down
I just wanna dance, wanna dance, wanna dance now

[Chorus]
You got all dressed up but there was nowhere to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When the cops shut down our rainbow
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I just wanna be your mirror
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The colors that you can hear
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny, he’s your answer man
Says he can read you like the back of his hand
Says he can make you understand
Watch out, he’ll be your best friend

Saw him in the woods skipping school
Talking trash and being rude
Smoking up, getting bent
Watch out, here he comes again

[Chorus]
You’re the new kid in town
Everybody tryin' to knock you down
They thought it hurt when they did it to me
I just laughed and I turned the other cheek
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

[Verse 2]
That mean girl, she’s got nothing to do
She tried to mess around with you
Tell her that it won’t be long
Play around and you’ll be conned

Some say it’s out of hate, some say it’s out of love
Some say it’s out of nothing, and some say that it’s just because –

[Chorus]
You’re the new kid in town
Everybody tryin' to knock you down
They were headed in the wrong direction
When they were messing with your affection
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior

You’re the new kid in town
Everybody tryin’ to knock you down
They thought it hurt when they did it to me
I just laughed and I turned the other cheek
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

[Outro]
You’re the new kid, and you’re a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re the new kid, and you’re a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

[Verse 1]
Was it my imagination?
Did you come out of the past?
You had horses behind you
But I didn’t want to ask

You’re so independent
You never needed nothing
Never needed no one
Never wanted to have fun

[Chorus]
That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along

[Verse 2]
You were standing on the corner
You were waiting for the beast
You had stories of prophets
But I didn’t want to tease

Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire

[Chorus]
I should have known right from the start
When you count on nothing, nothing falls apart
And then we stayed out all night
And in the morning you had second sight

That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along

[Outro]
Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire

"
123431,"

[Verse 1]
Just about the time, time I get off
You’re gonna roll right past with the radio on
I don’t mind
One more time, yeah, do it again
But you keep on saying that you’re my friend
I don’t mind

[Hook]
Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you’re gone

[Verse 2]
You take my love and you waste my time
Well, how can I help it if it sure feels fine?
I don’t mind
Here you come again looking like you do
I know you like it when I’m falling all over you
I don’t mind

[Hook]
Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you're gone
Radio on

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh I know that I gotta let you go, oh, oh
Oh, oh I can see that you’re just not the one for me

[Hook / Outro]
Radio on
With the radio on
Turn around and you’re gone

Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you're gone
With the radio on

[Verse 1]
I’ll find you everywhere
If you don’t exist, I don’t care
I’ll find you everywhere

Waterfalls are in the air
If you don’t see them, I don’t care
There are waterfalls in the air

[Chorus]
I saw you looking into the mortal mirror
I could see right through you
Even though you were right here

[Verse 2]
You’re a crystal chandelier
Your prisms ring so clear
Crystal chandelier

I’ll find you everywhere
If you don’t exist, I don’t care
I’ll find you everywhere

[Chorus]
And when I saw you
You were hanging out with your friends
I knew that it was over
But I didn’t know it had come to an end

Advance three paces forward and slip three paces back
There are words to be forgotten and statements to retract
For each and every action, there's one to counteract
Rendered useless, futile strivings, all for naught

Exact a small emolument, it never will be paid
Construct a flawless argument, it will not win the day
Erect a concrete monument, and it will wash away
Fruitless labors, wasted hours, down the drain

There are roads to be eroded and slates to be erased
Buildings to demolish, reputations to disgrace
Why was I surprised at my unlucky star's rebound
I once was found, but now I am lost and wound up in a lost-and-found

The wind will blow down windmills, unbending truths will bend
Abide by words of wisdom, yet meet a foolish end
A trial by trial-and-error, now start all over again
All for nothing, goose-egg zero, all in vain

But still I have the comfort of knowing when I die
That I will be among the choirs of angels up on high
Gently hovering o'er a cloud, I'll sing euphoniously
And strum upon a golden harp for all of eternity

A font of healing waters will soon become impure
A life of noble struggle will soon become obscure
Whatever your endeavor, it will yet be undone
Fruitless labors, fruitless efforts, fruitless toil

But still one must take courage, despair one must resist
For only for so long inclement weather can persist
Partly sunny, fair and mild, I heard the radio say
I'll call upon my fair-weather friends and fritter the day away

They came on a cool summer night when the moon was full
They landed behind City Hall in their module
Everyone was scared to death when they saw the flashing lights
Everyone came out to see what fell out of the sky

People brought their guns and their cameras and homemade bombs
People drove up onto the sidewalks and neighbors' lawns
They stood and waited for Martians to pop out of the pod
A tentacle with an eye on the end emerged from the hatch above

The eye swayed slowly above them from side to side
In an hour the crowd was completely hypnotized
Unearthly music filled the air like downy milkweed seeds
Until each man and woman fell to their knees

A door like a drawbridge opened and touched the ground
And the creatures moved through the people without a sound
They handed presents out to everybody there
They were so beautiful no one could tell what they were

When the world learned about their heavenly heirlooms
They were worth too much money to keep in their living rooms
So everyone donated them to the Municipal Museum
And a monument was built on the spot where the creatures from outer space

Had been
Had been
Had been

I was walking down the street, yeah, what do you think I see?
An unholy ceremony transpiring right in front of me
Prostrated there in worship before an idol made of stone
They worshipped graven images carved of wood and bone
It was blowing my mind, it was blowing my mind
I grabbed a piece of angle iron and smashed the idol made of stone
I burned the graven images carved of wood and bone
""This is an abomination,"" I shouted to the throng
""You must not worship loathsome idols
Don't you know that your idolatry is wrong?
Idolatry is wrong""

My son put up a poster of a rock 'n' roll star
He was sneering and surly, he was playing a guitar
""Who is this bum?"" I asked of him, ""I do not like his kind""
He said, ""He is my idol,"" it was blowing my mind
It was blowing my mind
I tore down the poster and said, ""This I cannot condone
I will not tolerate the worship of idols in my home
Idols in my home""

I went to the Museum of Natural History
To see the newly constructed Hall of Anthropology
I looked in the display case, inside it was enshrined
A loathsome golden idol, it was blowing my mind
It was blowing my mind
I smashed in the display case and crouched in the vitrine
And pushed the loathsome idol down the mezzanine
A museum guard approached me, his official badge unsheathed
He said, ""That was a priceless artifact
I must ask you to leave""
I said, ""I serve the Lord your God, by whom you are employed
My purpose is to topple loathsome idols
They must be destroyed""

In our day-to-day experience it has always been concealed
In the operating theater it now may be revealed
I saw the glistening human heart lying in repose
So tender and so vulnerable, beating and exposed

The human heart is a lustrous thing
A wondrous thing, the human heart
Look at the patient lying open wide
It cannot hide
The human heart

It has a passionate temperament, as everybody knows
Gushing grandiose sentiments as a toilet overflows
Throwing violent tantrums and prone to fits of rage
It can't keep still, it rolls around in its ribcage

The human heart is a preposterous thing
A monstrous thing, the human heart
Enlisting sympathy with vulgar sobs
It pounds and throbs
The human heart

And yet it lives for love and duty at its own behest
A lifetime through of work to do with ne'er a moment's rest
Sustaining vital organs, anointing them with blood
Devout in its vocation of vital organ-hood

The human heart is an untiring thing
An inspiring thing, the human heart
Despite the heartaches of the rolling years
It perseveres
The human heart

What strange abomination holds fancy over fact
What byzantine mutation would love what can't love back
What kind of freak of nature forgives a heinous crime
And leads us towards as yet untraveled paths to the sublime

The human heart is an inscrutable thing
An immutable thing, the human heart
The human heart is an untiring thing
An inspiring thing
A preposterous thing
A monstrous thing
A lustrous thing
A wondrous thing
The human heart

The court calls John Q. Public Nuisance to the stand
You are on trial for breaking laws throughout the land
Here a misdemeanor and there a felony
Remorselessly destroying private property

Breaking people's windows and vandalizing signs
Defacing public statues and condoning petty crimes
Dismiss the angry plaintiffs with a shrug or a guffaw
Hobby or profession, it is still against the law

The court calls John Q. Public Nuisance to the stand
You are on trial for disobeying God's command
In thought and word, in word and deed you have blasphemed
Now only by Christ's mercy can you be redeemed

Though you indulge an appetite for every sinful vice
Jesus offered up himself as a pascal sacrifice
He turned the other cheek and taught us to forgive
Did you not know he died that you and I may live?

Although it's evident you're guilty as can be
You've been acquitted on a technicality
The strife is o'er now, but in its aftermath
Jesus will be lenient, but God will show his wrath

I will not rise this morning or boss myself around
Nor will I attend my daily chores
Underneath the covers sipping ginger ale
All the livelong day I'll stay indoors

Today will be a day of rest, of medicine and broth
Of sitting out the world of busy-do
Today will be a sick day, quarantined at home
With my hot water bottle and the flu

I'll occupy my mind with a stack of various books
And miscellaneous mildewed magazines
Between some fits of coughing I'll ruminate and pine
And lose myself in restless fever dreams

Propped up on a pillow, a single piece of mail
A greeting card enjoining ""get well soon""
Today will be a day of rest, of thermometers and pills
And idle convalescence in my room

Jack Frost on my window, cascading flurries swirl
In the twilight's melancholy hue
Beside me on the nightstand, a vaporizer sings
An aqueous lullaby the whole night through

They say that faith can cure you and time heals many woes
I'll sleep and be reborn when I awake
Resume my happy duties and bear the easy yoke
Tomorrow I'll feel better than today

The kids, the kids, the kids, the kids

They're sneaking around, sneaking around, walking in on you
Walking in on you, it's true
Here they come, here they come, unannounced and unexpected
Walking in on you, they're coming through

Early in the morning, they're multiplying twofold
Growing in their numbers and their size
Picking the flowers, oh, walking through your home
Looking out for candy and for pie

Doesn't matter what they say, they'll say it anyway
Dragging along a shovel and a pail
Licking ice cream cones, eating candy bars
Riding on their bikes o'er hill and dale

They think that work is play, playing all the day
Innocent of worry and of care
Wasn't it yesterday that they weren't in the way?
Pestering their elders on a dare

The kids, the kids, they think they own the place
Barging in to make themselves at home
In their bathing suits, with their great big towels
Creeping forward to usurp your throne

Clumps of dust in my dustpan
I swept them up
And emptied them into the dustbin
Where they belong
I emptied them into the dustbin
Where they belong
They belong in a bin, a bin
They belong in a bin

I gathered a basket of vegetables
And rinsed them off
And emptied them into the vegetable bin
Where they belong
I emptied them into the vegetable bin
Where they belong
They belong in a bin, a bin
They belong in a bin

I picked you up at your doorstep
And drove along
And dropped you off at the looney bin
Where you belong
I dropped you off at the looney bin
Where you belong
You belong in a bin, a bin
You belong in a bin

Sometimes I feel like Fletcher Christian
Staring out across the sea
Torn apart by duty's shackles
The twisted tongues of loyalty

Well I sucked hard on every pleasure
Til my head begun to spin
He'll choose between the whip and feather
And that is where the crime begins

Sometimes I feel like Fletcher Christian
In paradise with the tables turned
Yes and I can feel the tatooist's needle
I can feel my neck and ankles burn

These south seas isles are cold and barren
But this civil war's been good for me
We took drugs and tore our uniforms
Gave up our captain to the sea

Sometimes I feel like Fletcher Christian
Twisting off the serpents head
For the mutiny I'll shoot the big one
Hot and hungry, far from home

Through the sun and sea my skin is peeling
But it don't make the pictures fade
Those shapes and symbols, I know their meaning
The shameless riches of another world

If I return they're sure to hang me
So I guess I'll have to stay
And if I should croak out in the darkness
No-one will know I got away

The dance floor's nearly empty now
Everyone's gone home
We're fragmented and broken up
Like love affairs
And as if seeing you for the first time
Something whispered
Looking at you in desperation
Knowing nothing ever happens

I wanted to say fall in love
I wanted to say fall in love with me
I wanted to say fall in love
It'll be alright

So beautiful, you were waltzing
Little frozen rivers all covered with snow
All fragmented and broken up
Oh, weIl I guess it's time to go

I wanted to say fall in love
I wanted to say fall in love with me
I wanted to say fall in love

I made a mistake
When I looked over my shoulder
Cromwell was right behind me
In the driving rain
I came out of the bathroom
Looking for my ticket
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again

Well I've been punched and beaten
Though it never shows
I'm going up to Sheffield
I don't know when I'm coming home
He took me in a corner
And I don't know why
I was looking for a friend
He shaved me dry

Never been in trouble
Don't call me on the phone
Put the blower in the bathroom
Burn the house and start from scratch
Searching for existence
With my red, red wine
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again

(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again

(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again
There was a caravan
Leaving in the dusk
I saw a man
Hold a chicken to his head
I'm telling you baby
I go up and I come down
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again

I see your frame
Flowing blood, unsympathetic veins
It’s nice to be so shaken all the time
I wanna be inside of your eyes
When you’re looking for a reason to feel ashamed like me
I am a black hole I take all in
Nothing feels the same
And in release there is relief in a way I know you’d be
If we had never met
I complicated it

There’s a shaking underneath my skin
I need you to let me in
‘Cause I am so much less and waiting to be fed
And waiting to be fed

I am a black hole
Everything I touch slowly turns to dust
And you are pure
I am a black hole
Everything I touch turns to dust
And you are pure
You are pure
You are pure

I need a wandering eye
The sorrow in my life
I need a wandering eye
The sorrow in my life
I need a wandering eye
The sorrow in my life
I need a wandering eye
The sorrow in my life

[Verse 1]
I’m a gardener of getting what I want
Where do I fit?
Where do I fit?
And all this heavy blood, filling up my gut
Where to put it?
Where to put it?

[Chorus]
Only you will let me in
When I’m tearing off my skin
All these people that I’ve been
Hold knives

[Bridge]
How long?
How long ’til I stop?
How long?
How long?

[Verse 2]
I’ll be ready for the great flood
When it comes in
When it comes in
When all of this unrest becomes part of marrow in my bones
Where to put it?
Where to put it?

[Chorus]
Only you will let me in
When I’m tearing off my skin
Only you
Only you

How long?
How long ’til I stop?
How long?

How long?
How long ’til I stop?

[Verse 1]
Waking up in the afternoon
Caught myself in the mirror
I didn’t recognize me
I am nothing without constant silence and light
And they’ve been hard to find

[Chorus]
And I only said that I’d be coming back
But I didn’t say that I’d be all one
And I only said that I’d be coming home
Oh, but I didn’t know, I didn’t know

[Verse 2]
And if I’m on the floor
Can you make sure I’m alright?
But don't try to tell me otherwise
Please, just help me up this time

[Chorus]
And I only said I wanted to be kind
But I never said I’d have the will to try
And I only said I wanted to be fine
And I didn’t know, I didn’t know

[Bridge]
And these are roads I know we’ve been on
So, can you focus all your gold on my walk?
And this feeling is a wheel and a wall
I don’t want to walk these circles, not at all

[Outro]
You can find me Sunday morning
All in pieces without warning
Did the same thing, found nothing
Now the falling isn’t stopping

[Outro Overlap]
It’s upon me
It’s pulling on me
It’s dragging me

You know they said
We were wrong
We were not
We were not
When you are not around
When you are not around
I am not alone
I am not alone

You know they said
We were wrong?
We were not
We were not
When you are not around
When you are not
I still have something to say
I still have something to say
I still have something to say because

You were waiting for me
You were waiting for me
You were waiting for me
I still have something to say
I still have something to say

When you are not around
When you are not
I still have something to say
I still have something to say

You were waiting for me
You were waiting for me
You were waiting for me

[Verse 1]
There was something in the way
We just sailed on through those days
Never wondered what was next
Never guessed it’d be like this
Never thought we’d feel this weight
Didn’t know it’d fade away
And even though it’s there, it never will be anywhere near where it was in those days

[Verse 2]
You are so close but far away
Even if we’re in the same town, you’re in a different place
How’d the time go by so fast?
I watched something that I loved just turn into the past

[Verse 3]
I can’t lift this weight
I don’t want it to fade away
And on the walls I wrote that I would never forget what happened in that place

[Chorus]
Is it over now?
Is it over?
Is it over now?
Is it?

[Bridge]
Never thought it’d fade away
Never thought we’d feel this weight
Even though I try i just can’t get it out of my mind
How much it meant to me

[Chorus]
It's not over now
Is it?
It's not over now
It's not over now
Is it?

[Verse 1]
I know you feel me in this corner
And in my life you are like water
With all the things that I replace with you
Every darkness I push through

[Verse 2]
There is a quiet familiar feeling
And in it I am always waiting
For everything to fall
Just like I always make it so

[Chorus]
Don’t you ever say that I'm wrong, ‘cause I won’t take it
I will find a way to justify my pain
I will cry, I will lie, and I won’t be satisfied
I will cry, I will lie, I will lie

[Bridge]
I will remind you of my mother
I will remind you of my mother
I will remind you of my mother
I will remind you of my mother, my mother

[Chorus]
Don’t you ever say that I'm wrong, ‘cause I won’t take it
I will find a way to justify my pain
I will cry, I will lie, and I won’t be satisfied
I will cry, I will lie, I will lie
I will lie

[Outro]
I just wanna feel skin
Just wanna let you in
But I am lost, oh
Just want you to know that I love you so
But I am lost
I am lost
I am lost

"
124195,"

And I know that I am always fucking up your world
You are better off not messing with that kind of girl

[Chorus]
What does that mean
When they say
Stay away from me?
What’s that mean?

[Verse 1]
If you’re wanting something else
Then that’s all you have to say
Clear water, love, and health
Then that’s all you have to say
Not to hear my voice on the phone saying that I’m not okay
I am underneath the water
Kicking every day

[Chorus]
What’s that mean?
Stay away from me
What’s that mean?
Stay away

[Verse 2]
If you’re wanting something else
Then I hope you find it
Clear water, love, and health
Then I hope you find it
I don’t wanna be the weight upon your shoulders when you wake
I don’t wanna drag you under
Kicking every day

[Chorus]
What’s that mean?
Stay away from me
What’s that mean?
Stay away
What’s that mean?
Stay away from me
What’s that mean?

Right off the bat I was scared what you’d think
I could barely play, not even old enough to drink
Started off well but spiraled quickly
Couldn’t see the forest through how you’d treat me

It’s a bad sign when the fights were never
Asking if we really belong together
Can’t stop now cause we’ve got plans, we’ve got plans, we’ve got plans

You think of leaving, you think of change
But you’ve worked so hard for what the con’s outweigh
Repetition becomes so comforting
Barely notice when someone stops listening

Can I admit that we are better off independently?
Can’t stop now cause we’ve got plans, we’ve got plans, we’ve got plans

I drew so many lines but then I still put up with it
In public, party, in private, hell
You love me like a sibling that you hate a little bit
It don’t mean much to me if you mean well

Cause I’ve got plans for me

I wanna be the man with the most space
So many things to do and prove and say
You’d better listen to me
I wanna be the one with the most cake
Strike a tougher pose
My apathy is catching, I am fine

Spin the world around me, I’ll just catch what’s mine
You’d better prove it to me that you’re having a hard time
My way from A to B is the fastest line

I wanna be the man with the most space
So many things to do and prove and say
You’d better listen to me
I wanna be the one with the most cake
In defense of a bigger mess
Watch the trainwreck, justified

Still you gotta wonder where we get it from
Expect to make moves no one will mind
What’s you’re excuse? Some entitled axe to grind?

I wanna be the man with the most space

It's alright to tell the truth
If it hurts then what's the use
In keeping on with this game
It's alright to break the chain

It's alright to tell a lie
People come and pass you by
If you no longer play the game
It's alright to break the chain
It's alright to break the chain
It's alright to break the chain

Chains will break
Notice they don't make mistakes
They're just there to remind you who you are
Chains will break
People come and go in the night before you wake to find them gone
Chains will break
They can take the strength link by link they'll rust away and disappear
Chains will break
Notice they don't make mistakes
They're just there to remind you of what you're not
Chains will break...

I skip the train at 9 because I didn't have the time
To skim my car it takes too long I'm sure that I'll be fine
But I'm not no no the stare of gare is yellow and he's got me
You know I move and hear them shout ""hey you""

Wake in london fields I ask ""what is the deal""
Conductor says ""tracks a mess someone's had enough""
I'm like ""come man you made me really late
You know you really fucked
So you know the sanction I get is on you""

I'm squinting from the train and battered by the rain
I say ""watch out"" I try to shout I hit him all the same
I'm like ""come on man you made me really late
You've really fucked me
You know the sanction I get is on you
Come on man you made me really late
You've really fucked me
You know the sanction I get it's on you""

It's the same thing that I had and it's been going round my mind
It's the same thing that you want and you're working at night
Out in the cold [x10]

[Verse 1]
Just leave with me
Never before have I seen
A void like this
Starring out into this wise
The eyes of suspense
Covering the lines in my hands
So kodiak
Gives up a ghost tonight

[Chorus]
Break through right breaking in sunlight
Never before have i found my way down
Break through right breaking in sunlight
Never before have i found my way down

[Verse 2]
Just leave me be
Never before have I seen
This pure scene
Never not even in a dream
I'm staying here
Staring out into the wise
Yes and what a sight
As everything flips into tonight

[Chorus]
Break through right breaking in sunlight
Never before have i found my way down
Break through right breaking in sunlight
Never before have i found my way down

Outside when, when we were young
Playing for two, drying in the sun
Take a deep breath, into the ocean
Endless sort of day, playing in slow motion
Way back when, in the back of your car
Windows down, music traveling so far
So far, so far
Take a deep breath, into the ocean
Endless sort of day, playing in slow motion
On the beach, break away
Summer nights, summer days
Long hair turning blonde
Staying out in the sun

Take a deep breath, into the ocean
Endless summer day, playing in slow motion
Take a deep breath, into the ocean
Endless summer day, playing in slow motion

(Verse 1)
Okay you got me admit I'm a fiend for the green/
Since a youngin day dreamin eating franks and beans/
In the back of the mind steaming tryna back out the demons/
But i'm lost in a corner blackout for any reason/
Spazz out for the cash go locc for the tokens/
Commit sin for the yen for the euro start poking/
My moms giving her all it ain't enough but we coping/
My homie stessin the same except for his moms dopin/
Its rules in the game hungry sharks in the tank/
Are you the trap or the bait are you the prey or the snake/
I been writing i love fighting i'm finna come up/
Turn my nightmares into schemes and hope I wake up/

(Chorus)
The dreams in your sleep don't show that/
The mirror on your wall don't show that/
Still remember when i ain't have a pot to piss in/
Now every move i make is like a motion picture /
I'm on one i'm on one i'm on yea/
We can go we can go we can go there/
G&b told me cause switch the style up/
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up/
Now what/

(Verse 2)
Fell in love with bad bitches let them play with my heart/
Been to war with co-defendants who now play with the narcs/
I ain't trippin never slippin I ain't trust from the start/
I ain't physic but these visions helped me pick you apart/
Conversations with the passengers from 370 /
Never known you personally but i could feel your soul/
We just 2 in the same we both lost in this world/
I ain't really gave a fuck since i lost my lil girl/
In the hood these dollars signs a get your legs and your face broke/
Its supply and demand and here its more rare/
The lust for these riches convince you to face the chair/
The Prada and the Gucci & louis got you influenced/
Intoxicated you rock that so now you made it/
The streets talking and now you on the affidavit/
The meat market where everyone's a moving target/
I'm just young black and heartless/

(Chorus)
The dreams in your sleep don't show that/
The mirror on your wall don't show that/
Still remember when i ain't have a pot to piss in/
Now every move i make is like a motion picture /
I'm on one i'm on one i'm on yea/
We can go we can go we can go there/
G&b told me cause switch the style up/
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up/
Now what/

(Bridge)
I goes on and on till the break of dawn/
It goes on and on till the break dawn/
It goes on like I'm just tryna live my life/
I'm just tryna live/
It goes on and on till the break of the dawn/
If you let me let me I could put you on/
I'm just tryna live my life/
I'm just tryna live/

(Chorus)
The dreams in your sleep don't show that/
The mirror on your wall don't show that/
Still remember when i ain't have a pot to piss in/
Now every move i make is like a motion picture /
I'm on one i'm on one i'm on yea/
We can go we can go we can go there/
G&b told me cause switch the style up/
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up/

Do it to till i ain't gotta ask if it's good enough/
I'ts a sure thang baby girl like a lay-up/

Look back at it throw it to me back it up lord/
Let me take it I can make it make it thunderstorm/

It's friday night let's just go in/
We been speaking for months been hard to hold in/
But now we mentally connected here's my suggestion/
Let's get into some body stimulation/
No mimi shit no hanging from poles unless you wanna/
Can i smoke this weed up while i watch your solo action/
Awaiting my moment to make a splash and/
Lord that body so toned should be on maxim/
Nervous stomach in knots well lets stretch it out/
New shit for your friends and you to talk about/
Beat it up to it's hard for you to walk around/
Just let me take my time/
I love to explore I search through it all/
Until I find that button to open the flood door/
This is thug passion baby lets turn it up/
I'm a give what you need and give you more of what you want/
Overtime/

(verse2)
You feel a little restricted go head and take it off/
I'll help you get out them britches let's get more involved/
Money power and bitches already had them all/
So there's no way that we'll part/
Open up your temple different strokes will bring us closer/
Make our own music room sounding like a orchestra/
I love to play your strings and making your body sing/
They way you blow that horn gone make me go buy a ring/
It's all by design the nights picture perfect/
So we should turn the lights on so I can watch you work it/
You know I'm in shape infatuated by yours/
I know you almost there your legs locking like jaws/
Don't that feel incredible go head and O.D./
So edible you going to give me some cavatis/
Till you lose all control got no intentions to stop/
I'm putting in that work like i'm punching the clock/
Overtime/

(chorus)
I do it to i ain't gotta ask if it's good enough/
Do it to till i ain't gotta ask if it's good enough/
I'ts a sure thang baby girl like a lay-up/

Look back at it throw it to me back it up lord/

I do it to I ain't gotta ask if it's good enough/

I want to know a backward compatible companion
A tired road, a sleeper in the grass
The days are ruined, it’s like a thousand afternoons
Just landed in my lap and swore themselves to secrecy
But whatever they’re keeping is not worth me seeking

It’s not too late for me to touch your virtual body
And your estate isn’t all that heavily guarded
It gets so cold that next time I break the mold
I’m gonna wrap myself up in all of the pieces
And I wanted you so bad, I wanted you so bad

I’m getting old and I’m trying to keep my propeller
Above the fold and on the bottom line
There’s nothing more, I don’t know what this antenna’s for
But as long as there is a 24 hour convenience store
I’ll be conscious forever with my hands tied together

It’s just one step above a stick and a torn up bandana
It’s hard to love it’s harder still to join
The highway stars in a world of high calorie protein bars
And a trophy for the leader of the double dippers
And I wanted you so bad, I wanted you so bad

Who let the time I watched slip by through the gate, and back into your place
And under the stairs where I used to sleep
And why is it I only miss you when you’re not around
And I'm never that hungry until you don’t feed me
Now your thinking is deeper
I am on shallower ground
There’s nothing to play with here and you won’t let me out

Time is a chew toy and you’ve ripped out all of the cotton
Everyone knows I'm a lover but now even that has gone rotten
You lost what you’re looking for, you didn’t even check in the garden
But that’s exactly where it’s been hiding
Your eyes are still bluer than mine but my muscles are black
And the tears came rushing out of you like they were under an attack

Your caffeinated touch
And the things that I've chosen not to think of very much
Have gotten all their hands on me
Now I'm in double dutch
And there's something in the nothingness but nothingness is such
Such a something or nothing or something or nothing

So who let the time I let sneak by under the fence and over my head
And back underground where it first came from

"
126253,"

I could watch the days disintegrate or I could start rebuilding them
with double clicks, triple titles, fire me just like a rifle
Buy your kindness at the store and lay me out across the floor
I do not need your money just like I don’t need you anymore
I’ll hit the button like I should and leave you like a lover would
And never try to make you mine like you my darling clementine
Are you a sight for sore eyes, a reason to get more eyes, or a nonessential part in my escape
And is there anybody watching over me, I better run before it’s too late

Solid chunks of energy or liquid if you have to fake it
Find the subtle outline, hold it up to light and try to trace it
With your bland tasting, hand shaking, head racing past the coffee copy maker
Always take a second to prepare for all the awful things you’re bound to see out there
I saw two or three this morning, they were inching closer to your hair
And riding in your shopping cart, making nests inside your heart
And acting like they never knew your name
But I don’t need this that bad do I

My skin is getting thinner and the days are getting harder
But at least the spots under my eyes are getting darker
And my sleeves are getting shorter and my face is turning gray
But it’s not like all the money here just shriveled up or walked away
Or moved to another dimension, or simply stopped existing in the formal sense despite my best intentions
And no one in the morning ever gives themselves to me
So why do I offer myself to the morning
And why do all the days continue passing without any kind of warning

But forgetting all the ticket stubs and rubber gloves and tooth decay
Driving home with heavy eyelids shaking my head half the way
And leaning in the kitchen which is fine enough for me I guess
And waiting for the ringing telephone not to scare me to death
There’s frosting that is piled high caking up against my gums
It’s thicker than the coat of dust that’s settling atop my lungs
No matter how I sift through I’ll never sort your tangles
Just forget about watching over me because I am the one who guards the angels

But I swear my anger is not livid enough
And my memories are not vivid enough
And my nerves are not timid enough
And you are not forgiving enough
And I’m not really living enough to make any of this seem worthwhile

No my anger is not livid enough
And my memories are not vivid enough
And my nerves are not timid enough
And you are not forgiving enough
And I'm not really living enough to make any of this seem worthwhile

But there’s gotta be some reason to find you
Aside from your hair blowing behind
You there’s gotta be some reason to find you aside from your hair

Watch us on the ground
Sunlight in your eye
Drink the poison down
Tell you what lifes about

The night of 1000 degrees
Decisions were pulling me
We laughed til we couldn’t breath
We laughed til we couldn’t speak

Drove down to the shore
The tides were getting high
You pulled me by my side
You said come on let’s ride

As the pictures fall from the wall
Should we pick them up or throw them away ay

Can you feel the vibration as we start to fight
I’m sleeping with my eyes closed
For the very first time
And I’m hanging with the angels as you start to cry
I’m burning up my baby
I’m burning up my love

I’m on the edge of
I’m on hell with your crystal life
And your head over there
So dangerous so dangerous
Fickle people in a fickle time
About that girl she head over time
So dangerous so dangerous

With a little splash of that oh so shine
You’re so dangerous so dangerous
Fickle people in a fickle time
About the girl she head over time
So dangerous so dangerous

These soft hands have a grip
Of where the body they're a part of's going
If it gets up in the morning
Papa's jeans never fit
Handed down his looks and nervous ticks
But what about callouses?
He deserves each wink of sleep - white canvas is all he dreams of
I dream of bombast abstractions
Will they be something that he's proud of?
Will i ever receive applause from my creators or history's long thumb?
Will i ever go to bed thinking i earned my good fortune?

These soft hands on my hips...
We'll finally dance along to melodies we sing inside our head all day
They'll stay with us 'til they see the light

Until then, i'll give what i got, even if it's not special -
Cuz i learn what i'm not when i'm out of perspective
I find i fall in at the very last second
But my body makes it hard to leave a lasting impression

These soft hands have a grip (i find i fall in)
Of where the body they're a part of's going (at the very last second)
But my body makes it hard...

It's what i'm working with, it's what i work toward
Not what i'm working on, or who i'm working for
Is it worth it?

It's what i'm working with, it's what i work toward
Not what i'm working on, or who i'm working for
Is it worth it? am i worth it?

And when it's done we'll dance and dance and dance

Jumping wildly atop my bed
I cross my fingers and move ahead
Hope divides a shaking force
With oven mitts, can't shut that door

Pigeon shit on a marble shrine
Hope glowing or a well-lit lie?
Pigeon shit on a marble shrine
In a squint, looks like no. 5

Like the memories that you keep trace of
Like the animal that we have caged up
Like the body you'll never escape from
Like the sciences behind our make-up
Like the temple that you are the base of
Like the spectrum that we are shade of
Like an energy you cannot break up

Organize organize keep it sorted

Organize organize keep it sorted

Exercise exercise keep it sorted
Wait in line wait in line fill the forms in
Be on time be on time bring your own pen

We've made up our minds and we've made up a mission
Got borders and freedoms and unknown conditions
I hope you don't, hope you don't, hope you don't, hope you -
I hope you don't, hope you don't, hope you don't mind

Blinders, car windows, or a life full of lust
What pressures of needing will generate luck?
It's not gambling, gambling, gambling, gambling
Gambling, gambling, gambling life away

What's special to you isn't special to everyone
Some things you love mean not much to another
Can't say any, say any, say any, say any
Say any, say any, anyone's wrong

I borrowed a friend's spine and it held me up
The things that you need will arise from the dark
Just like wishing wells, wishing wells, wishing wells, wishing wells
Wishing wells, wishing wells, wishing wells will

Omit your hopes when somebody you know feels lonely
Won't try controlling you, that part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through

But if we mix 'em right, like an apple pie
The flavours might just make us shine
Like a pretty bee, lost to the breeze
How it doesn't need to see
And if we free up time, we could spend it right
We could bend the light all the ways we'd like
Like a brand new child abandoned in the wild
Thinkin' we're so free

It's dinner time and we're all inside
It's first the rides and then the pie
I lead the seats and then the meat
Then we do the greet just as you leave
Thinkin' if we free up time, we could spend it right
We could bend the light all the ways we'd like
Like a brand new child abandoned in the wild
Thinkin' we're so free

Omit your hopes when somebody you know feels lonely
Won't try and control you, that part of myself that i flow through
Omit your hopes when somebody you know feels lonely
Won't try and control you, that part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
(won't try and control you)
That part of myself that i flow through

New face
Same shoe
New lace

Old coat
Old cane
Same note

Stay lofty!

I know our heads get better once it all fits between us
I'll walk in any weather if distance means we'll team up
Never let it grow from me, bound to a bed and blanket
I know that my home will be wherever i have made it

They'd tell us a joke
'bout the good old days

Is it my place to carve my name in someone else's tree?
To try and trim my neighbour's limbs when I don't like the leaves?
Cuz the fruit nature makes,
won't always taste the same in two different kitchens!

Is it my way to speak my mind, and argue when you're wrong?
An off-note slides, it keeps inside, so we can sing along.
And I know how you feel...
And I'm sorry that we deal a little bit different.

Yeah we function as brothers would,
having our fits and holding contempt for each other.
Be careful as I plod beneath this canopy of boughs and leaves,
cuz these forest friends were hard to find
if I only brave the woods at night!

We'll never fuck up as brothers,
We'll sometimes fuck up as friends.

Is it so bad to want a space where I can be my own?!
A groove where I can hide away, my forest friends may never know
How my hymns twist and bend...
But I love that we can spend an evening singing!

Is it so bad to want a place where I can slow it down?
A half-time beat protecting me from voices pirouetting 'round.
And I don't mean to hurt...
And I'd like to learn to be a bit better!

Yeah we function as brothers would,
holding a place and saving a tune for each other.
Speak lightly as I plod beneath this canopy of yelps and screams,
cuz these forest friends were hard to find
if I only brave the woods at night.

Opening windows is closing my doors

Stopped for directions, then dissected
Wanna get home on time, and they wanna see my insides

Never once thinking bout airplanes

Another flash on the screen, another pinch from the dream
A reminder to just keep living

There's no outlet for you remaining

Sick with a virus, and the bug has got me pious
I feel it all shutting down, so i look to the clouds
Maybe they'll remember who i was

They say, read this, feel this, do this, do that
Eat right, exercise or you'll get fat
Get happy, get pissed, PCs and desist
Don't slit your wrist, its a blessing to exist
It's a lesson to be learned, penny saved penny earned
Have some kids, its your turn
Have a heart, do your part
Get smart, get informed
Protest the war

Play the hand your dealt
We're only trying to help

Been torn from yours

I time traveled and unraveled the mysteries of the universe
And now I know
Now I know what not to do with you

Open up and jump, the longer you wait the longer you'll hesitate
And as for me I'll let gravity take its course, 'cause I've fallen already

What were those words you said as you were leaving?
Were they recycled from the mouths of dead poets? I'll pretend I didn't notice
Let's depend on springtime to cure our broken hearts

And in the mean time, you and I should just
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Manage on, my soul unraveling

Drinking beer, skipping school

We made mistakes together
Let's make them while we're young

And then we drifted apart

If you didn't lighten up your act
But you didn't go crazy

We'll meet from time to time

Nothing to say

But i guess things happen that way.'
We were friends once
That's all i'd say for sure
Cause everything else got screwed up
And it's just some angry blur
Well i guess i do things different
But i guess i can't complain
Thought about some old times
I had myself a beer
Sung to myself the first verse
Of ""still crazy after all these years""
But you didn't seem crazy
In fact, i'd never seen you so happy
We'll meet from time to time
But we'll soon find that we have
Nothing to say
We'll just say 'hey
I don't like it
But i guess things happen that way.'

[Intro]
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me

[Verse 1]
You wander into the bedroom
You're drunk, we've done this before
You stumble over like 3 seconds later
And kick your boots on to the floor
I can hardly see your eyes
You forgot to put your hair up
I can see you've learned some tricks
From those boys over in Europe
But still, it kinda makes me glad
To see how quick we fall into those old rhythms and patterns

[Chorus]
If you want it, you got it
You only want it when you're drunk
My friends say you're obnoxious
You're not so bad when we're alone

[Verse 2]
Morning comes
I know how the next part goes
One last dance
Then you delete me off your phone
In the hallway
Your eyes stay on the ground
Doesn't bother me because when the weekend rolls around

[Chorus]
You'll want it, and you'll get it
You only want it when your friends have all been bedded
You'll be outside smoking on the porch
""Come in"", I'll say, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Lorado Taft directs a steely gaze
Down upon the plot of one Dexter Graves
There are no jumping spiders here
Ashtabula is long gone
Are you without a destination?
Have you finally found a home?

Center Ave leads further into the dark
Where Lawson's crusader stands
Although Lawson lies unmarked
You stand draped and hooded here
But I know who you are
Past the point of trepidation
Past the point of we are

[Chorus]
Is this really happening?
Or is this just nothing at all?
I'm sorry I let you down
If I let you down before
'cause I feel nothing
And that's just what I felt before
I'm sorry I let you down
If I let you down before

I know I'll make it if I just keep on running
I know that daylight is fast approaching
There are girls and werewolves hot on my trail
There are willows and widows in funeral veils

[Chorus x2]

Vill du sova
Sova över
Sova över i vårt land?
När du vaknar
Vaknar sakta
Får du se nåt som du glömt

Bladen och granen
Du brukar gråta
När marken kittlar dina tår
Ljuset på gatan
Man får förlåta
Dom som vill kalla det vårt land

Vinner ensam
Ingen ser det
Ingen ser allt som du kan
Om du vaknar
Och saknar andra
Saknar alla som du glömt

Bladen och granen
Du brukar gråta
När marken kittlar dina tår
Ljuset mot gatan
Man får förlåta
Dom som vill kalla det vårt land

Bladen och granen
Du brukar gråta
När marken kittlar dina tår

[Verse 1]
Looking over everything
From high up on the wall
The treeline spans the distance
I can hardly see beyond
The world threw me it's problems
And I threw 'em all right back
Got tired of living vicariously
Through my pen and pad
The shotgun against my sternum
Said the game was finally through
Well I watched it go and spread my wings
To come on home to you!

[Verse 2]
A circle in the distance
Crowns the faded ebony sky
The shot rang out for miles
Heard the sirens start to cry
As I laid back in that cool October soil
Then I thought...
That I might have had the answer
But that information's lost
And far below down in the city
Cars are screeching through the night
While the gunner laid his life down
On that rusted army knife

[Verse 3]
And I felt the river flowing
All returning to the land
And I spat my bitter loathing out
Releasing it all at last
But just as I began to know
The first moments of peace
A blue clad angel grabbed my neck
And he chose to say his piece
They asked who pulled the trigger
And I swore it wasn't me...

[Chorus]
... Then I laughed and said I lied!
I lied down by the wall
To hear the voices call!
The ghosts of the forest
In summertime
Are all long gone!

[Verse 4]
Well they threw me in a big white box
And took me somewhere safe
I didn't care where we were going
My soul had left that tepid place
And they re-filled that empty basin
With all the contents of their bags
With a needle they resurfaced
All the fissures, cracks, and crags
So they filled me up with dopamine
And isoflurane too
And they sent me off to summer camp
With pills red, white, and blue

[Verse 5]
From there I watched the sunset
Watched the warm hues fade away
'Til it left me with the coldest skies
Of dark blue, black, and gray
And I sat in silent wonder
Of the stories that I knew
And I found myself debating
If a word of them was true
So herein lies the ending
The summit of my fears
The spirits that I chased so long
Won after all these years

[Chorus]
They died!
I lied down by the wall
To hear the voices call!
The ghosts of the forest
In summertime
Are all long gone!

[Outro]
I cried!
I lied down by the wall
To hear the voices call!
The ghosts of the forest
In summertime
Are all long gone!

[Verse 1]
Boys marching to war
To certain defeat
They were younger than me

Guns poke through the trees
Death on a limb
They were aiming at him

[Hook 1]
And when the bullets came, he didn't duck
He wrapped her pantyhose around his neck

And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Away to some place mystical and warm
His lucky charm

[Verse 2]
He got caught
No cover at all
He'd breathe in her scent
Not even a scratch

He didn't die
When he stepped on a mine
They were violet and soft
It didn't go off

[Hook 2]
And when her letter came he didn't cry
He wrapped her pantyhose around his eyes

And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Even though she didn't love him anymore

You can't kill a lucky charm

"
127309,
127310,"

[Verse 1]
Louise, she just wasn't thinking
When she climbed into his bed
She only wanted to lie beside him
To hell with his best friend
She woke him up and she whispered
But the answer wasn't good:
""Whatever made you think I would ever love you
Even if I could?""

[Chorus]
Louise
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise
I'll love you 'til I'm dead
Louise
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France

[Verse 2]
She came from across the country
Just to stare into her phone
She came to the same apartment
She only wanted to be left alone
And she could catch anybody's attention
But it never won her friends
Love could kick you out on the streets
But it'd never pay your rent

[Chorus]
Louise
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise
I'll love you til I'm dead
Louise
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France

"
127311,"

[Verse 1]
You, you'd fall in love with anyone
I think you'd fall in love with anyone
Who fell in love with you
And they frequently do

So take comfort
Cruel comfort
Before you start to wonder
How you got locked inside your room

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you let them down gently
Does it only make it harder
To let the feeling linger
To drag it out a little longer

Does it put your mind at ease?
But you're the one who brought 'em here
You're the one who has to take 'em when you leave

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you' love me
I'm not saying any

"
127312,"

[Verse 1]
Well this thing that we had built
Was flaying into shreds
It was sharp and it was dry
Like the hair on a shrunken head

And all the king's men
Spread the pieces on the floor
By the time they fit together
We had forgotten what they were for

Pretending like she's beautiful
In the pictures I can see
But she only picks the good ones
That's more than I can say for me

[Chorus]
But that's the way it always starts
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
Always making out like bandits
Until you getaway and it falls apart
It falls apart

[Verse 2]
You're always dressed up like a priest
You're always drilling through the wall
Cracking the safe and skipping town
While poor Rosemary takes the fall

You're always looking for the future
Rinsing out the dye
Looking for a moral to the story
That sounded good and happened to rhyme

Rosemary on the gallows
Dressed like nothing's wrong
No funeral no flowers
For an outlaw in a song

[Chorus]
But that's the way it always starts
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
Always making out like bandits
Until you getaway and it falls apart
It falls apart
[Repeat]

"
127313,"

There's a beautiful girl
And a handsome guy
She's sitting all alone
He's giving her the eye

They approach one another
They don't realize the danger

What will they say
What do you think
She'll crack another smile
He'll buy another drink

That isn't the important part
That happens later

You should have listened to your mother
Don't ever talk to strangers

Lust turns to boredom
Boredom turns to lust
Diminishing returns
With each and every thrust

The energy's preserved
Just converted into anger

Don't take candy
Don't get in someone's car
Don't let anybody touch you
No matter who they are

The police are at your door
Turns out the killer was your neighbor

He seemed like such a normal guy
A little quiet, nothing major

You should have listened to your mother
Don't ever talk to strangers

"
127314,"

Who's gonna pay attention
To the redheads of the world
Who's gonna call them up at night
When they're naked and alone

Who's gonna kiss the brown haired girls
Who's gonna wipe away their tears
And what about the black haired girls
Who's gonna whisper filthy things into their ears

Cause anyone who ever had a brain
Wouldn't stand out in the rain
Or keep it up for very long
Just to prove somebody wrong

And anyone who ever had a heart
Or sang a lonesome song
Would sell their little souls
Just to make it with the blonde

It's just unearned admiration
Are you sick of all the stares
You don't need to hide yourself away
You only need to dye your hair

But it won't do you any good
Cause pretty soon your roots will be showing
And anytime you try to leave the room
They'll ask you just where the hell
Do you think you're going

"
127315,"

[Verse 1]
Sneaking the pillow under the sheets
I know a place where everyone meets
But she knows a place
Where the cops don't go
And she'd be the one if anyone knows

[Pre-Hook]
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

[Hook]
Then don't stop
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop
The daughter of a cop

[Verse 2]
Making love is an easy thing to do
And she didn't feel like pushing herself
But don't be fooled
'Cause it could have been you
Or him or anyone else

[Pre-Hook]
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

[Verse 3]
Then when the fix comes in
She'll get a slap on the wrist
And leave you in a cell to rot

[Hook]
So don't stop
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop
The daughter of a cop
Don't stop
The daughter of a cop
Don't stop
The daughter of a cop

"
127316,"

(Verse)
Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm tryna tell you something
Something that I already said
You like a pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who's tryna sell you something
Something that you already have

(Chorus)
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing

(Verse)
While the others talk
We were listening to lovers rock
In her bedroom, in her bedroom
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over and sit a little closer

(Chorus)
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing

"
127317,"

I think it's funny how you could find yourself alone
With someone else in an ideal situation
Without a shred of good intentions between you
Much less a decent explanation

I couldn' tell you why she summoned me
Sometimes you get lucky
And they think that you were someone else

I can't remember what she said
Was she trying to tell me something
Or talking to herself

Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend

But it made it hard to sleep
'Til her head felt even worse
And I hope that she felt miserable
When it was time to go to work

Her and her friend
Just did it as revenge
So any excess pain you feel
Isn't any consequence

But don't feel bad
Cause you didn't stand a chance
You can make a hasty exit
That's how they handle it in France

Little consolation
Even if you always knew it
So any nasty things I say
Are purely theraputic

Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend

Close the door leave on the light
And kiss her for a little while
The liquor soaked into the sheets
She said it's getting late you'd better leave

"
127318,"

The sound of mass confusion
Reverberated down the hall
Into the ears of a stoic roommate
Who put her headphones on
But in the space between the songs
(Thats where she paid the most attention)
Beneath the crack on the door
(The candle flickered and got extinguished)
The reassuring hum of the freeway
As she drifted off to sleep
And it was five o'clock in the morning
You had no good reason to leave

Ooh baby I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all
(I'll come when you call)

Linda Rondstadt on the radio
She was singing Warren Zevon
Hold me tighter Carmelita
Make the night not last so long
And if it seems so peaceful now
(Why don't you wait until the morning light?)
And catch the eye of the stoic roommate
(As you leave without saying goodbye)
And if you're ever let to wonder
Why anything goes right
Thank the god of bad decisions
The queen of lonely nights

Ooh baby, I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all
(I'll come when you call)

"
127319,"

[Verse 1]
Standing in the kitchen
Wondering where Anjela's gone
She didn't even drive here
She couldn't have gotten very far

What does it matter anyways?
I didn't like her anyways
I only let her crawl into my arms
I wasn't trying to lead anyone on
I was only trying to stay warm

[Chorus]
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her

[Verse 2]
There was euphemisms and arrangements
There was alleged transgressions
She said, ""I'm not very good at talking about this stuff
So nevermind""
She buried her face in the pillow

What does it matter anyways?
She didn't like me anyways
I only thought because she climbed into my arms
But she wasn't trying to turn anyone on
She was only trying to stay warm

[Chorus x2]
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her

[Verse 1]
Colorblind
Seems like I've been using someone’s eyes
Can't recall the love that I’m after
Broken nose
Pay for all the chances you’re supposed to have

[Chorus]
If I could then I'll try a hundred times before
To get through the absence of seeing distant shores
I wonder if I change the colors throughout her
The world could be your fantasy

[Verse 2]
I've dreamt through days with hostile memories
Differences you make up between us
Honeycombs
Ice cream melts the bottoms of your toes
Turning malice into affection

[Chorus/Outro]
You always were eager to dig into the sand
While I was dreaming of holding your hand
If we hide under the covers together
The world could be your fantasy

"
127912,
127913,
127914,"

Fading into blue
Waves crashing under you
Waves crashing under you
Nothing will change it
I knew you
I felt, sometimes
The air so light

You were never meant to wander
Far away from cold air
Are you tempted by the colors
Far away?

Always out of touch
The patterns change so much
The patterns change so much
So hard to follow
You chose to
Fly out into the air at night

You were never meant to wander
Far away from home
Watching the passing time
Everything is frozen

Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

It’s like heaven in here, here, here
It’s like heaven in here, here, here

I don’t care about your past
I really don’t care about your future
I can feel you right now, right here
That’s all that matters

And it feels like heaven
When you take me there, there, there
When you touch me there, there, there

As I walk along the Earth
I know that you are out there
And if you’re not here with me right now
It doesn’t really matter

Still feels like heaven
Like heaven
Like heave

We’re already there, there, there
We’re already there, there, there

Hey friend, I haven't seen you much
It's my fault, I've been so out of touch
New club? No, you go on ahead
Old blood, I'll dance when I am dead
When I'm dead
I'll dance when I'm dead
That was a killer show
Makes sense to take it on the road
Not me! I can't afford the risk
You tour, I'm on the mailing list
Go ahead
I'll tour when I'm dead
I don't know what else to say
I don't know what else to say
Maybe I'll get to it someday
I see myself at 94
Spare dreams stuck on life support
No wait, if that's what lies ahead
I'll change or put it off and dream when I'm dead
I don't know what else to say
End all my thoughts the same way:
""Maybe I'll get to it someday""
I've been so drunk on safety
I think I'm going crazy
Don't want my ghost to hate me
Time's running

[Verse 1]
Come on help me start a fire
Let your friends know there's a feast
Bring the burden on you back
Strokes and heart-attacks
Bring them all to me
Bring your life-style magazines
Bring your Levis jeans
Bring your iPhones and your suits
Bring your BMW
Bring them all to me

[Chorus]
As the world is getting darker
I will start a little fire
As the world is getting darker
I will start a little fire just for you

[Verse 2]
Come on help me start a fire
Let your friends know there's a feast
Bring the churches and the mosques
Bring the leaders of the world
Bring them all to me
Bring your well-ness magazines
Bring Al Qaida, CIA, Miley Cyrus, Timberlake
Bring the racists and the thieves

[Chorus]

Against demons reading to you your dreams
Telling you things you don't want to hear

[Intro]
Fillmore, Texas
Greensboro, North Carolina

[Verse 1]
Bobby and Caroline and North Cakalacky
He left home and never comin' back here
Cussin' and grinnin' and hummin' that tone
Huffin' in smoke from a ham bone

[Verse 2]
Comin' to the city with a big old grin
Pork grease goin' down his chin
Tryin' to make money while havin' some fun
Pickin' at a chicken with a BB gun

[Verse 3]
Bought him in an alley, got a Bushwick kid
Had to grind home ?
Granddaddy Hurley's(?) got a gold tooth grin
There ain't no ? like a ?

[Bridge]
He left home, never go back
He left home, don't want to go back
Back

[Verse 4]
Found his body in a black Cadillac
? liver in a domino factory(?)
Put him on a train in a box of pine
Sent him back down to Caroline

[Outro]
Bobby and Caroline and North Cakalacky
He went home

Going down to the river, gonna set right down

Verse 1:
I remember those days
Lil’ kid chilling, I would play with my toys
Pokémon villains, gotta’ tame them boys
Built friendships, but I had to let go(Lego)
Growing up quick
That’s the thing that stays yo
Same with thing with my mojo
Left with a few real that I know /
So lets go
To time where we had silly horrors
Roaming the woods like explorers
Conquer the beasts right before us
Talking bout’ pretty girls in our fortress
And man not a worry in world-blind to it all
Till’ I grow tall, I won’t bust my nerve
But that time’s here, and I got the call
Say hello to this place that’s called earth

Hook:
(Mmm!)
We'll go through all these changes, walk these places
To next chapter, flip the pages
Yeah I know this
We'll just go through all these stages
I don’t get down I feel amazing
X2

Verse 2:
I’m feeling superman, can't(kent) feel another way
Buddha stance has me wishing I could levitate
Blunts at glance, has me thinking to elaborate
I'm just trying find my place, fam
On this road, that’s not close to home
Reaching to some places that are way beyond
What about this style, will they give their nods
I’ll just do my thing try to beat the odds
Two cents for toss, sentiments in vault
Opened up for all, so you could see my flaws
I might go to mars the way I rocket
I’m the only pilot, zooming by in my spaceship
I just landed, another planet
With the colors on my palette
Picasso, my talent, so scratch where I've been
Only matters where we headin'
[Bridge]
When I was teen, I felt lost in the universe
Yet I still feel so lost in the universe
But I was losing hope, for my place in the universe
Now I see how I belong in the universe

Didn't know everything was connected yeah
Didn't know I was sleeping through my life yeah
Now I hope, we could make some good changes yeah
So let's grow, cuz that’s we came for yeah

Hook:
(Mmm!)
So many places, so many changes
Just gotta face it, we’ll go through these stages
Onto the next chapter, just flippin these pages
So many changes, but I think that we'll get through them
So many changes, yeah I know I that we'll get through them

I've been watching a river
I've seen it dressed in a breeze
So I wanted to get closer
I find I'm sinking to my knees

And I'm sinking in mysteries that I can’t quite unfold
I'm talking about alchemy and things that explode

I was a young boy
When I was thrown in the world
My hands were made out of silver
You see they're looking for gold

And to find a solution of value intrinsically
And they're playing with dreams that they call alchemy

Hu-huh ...

Tell me. Whisper everything
And I'll put it all to good use
When you took my hand to grab me away
That's when l held it all out to you

And I'm watching everything that you do so don't be impatient
Turning to alchemy, turning to alchemy, turning to alchemy, turning to alchemy
Turning to alchemy, turning to alchemy, turning to alchemy, turning to alchemy
...

(Lloyd)
I stood out alone and shaken
All the love it had been taken
Cast adrift on a stormy sea
Been cut up bad
But, I'm too blind to bleed
I'm pleading, baby, take away the pain
Pleading, baby lake away the pain
In the night your love's a beacon
That's the light l've been seeking
So darling don't forsake it
Take this heart and smash or break it
I'm pleading, baby take away the pain
A dozen roses that is all
I've seen them come up now and watched them fall
Like scattered pieces of a dream
Of broken hearts lost in a foggy steam
Pleading, baby tale away the pain
Pleading, baby take away the pain
In the night your love's a beacon
That's the light I've been seeking
So darling don't forsake it
Take this heart and smash or break it
I'm pleading, baby take away the pain
Pleading, baby take away the pain
In the night your love's a beacon
That's the light I've been seeking
So darling don't forsake it
Take this heart and smash or break it
I'm pleading, baby take away the pain
Pleading, baby take away the pain

I've been up and darling you can't bring me down
No
Cause I been oh so good
Yet, honey l won't wear a crown
Cause I was hurt and tired walking through a Field of Fire
Now I'm not going to add no fuel not on to the funeral pyre
I was stoned, cold broke baby
I was tossed around
Seeing you walk right by me babe with your eyes
Pinned down to the ground
Well, you were lost, hurt and tired
Walking through a Field of Fire
So we don't have to add no fuel not on to the funeral pyre
We can shrug it off
Baby we can walk it off
Hey, don't call me no lair
I've beenthrough the Field of Fire
I've been up and darling you can't bring me down
No
I've been oh so good
Yet, honey, I won't wear a frown
Well we were lost, hurt and tired
Walking through a Field of Fire
See we don't have to add no fuel no not to a funeral pyre
We can shrug it off
Baby we can walk it off
Little darling I just walked it off
Hey, so don't call me a lair
I've been through the Field of Fire

Hold but let go

Hold but let go
Hold but let go

Hold but let go

Hold but let go

All these days
Never the same one life from heaven
And in between all the things
You've seen on way to heaven

Some words for two
Do they choose on way to heaven
All for chance
You can sleep hand in hand in your heaven

Through that dark spit a reason
And despite reason came the ghosts
And nothing that was needed
Was everything needed most

So take shelter from the ash
Take shelter from the ash

I think I see a knight
I'm gonna fuck him for a while
And the ocean is gone
But I can see for miles
I can see there's nothing here
Smile
I can hear all your sorrows
I think I'm going crazier and healthier
I can see the obvious
That there is nothing here
Still

"
130855,"

I see it coming closer now
I see it very clear
The tree, the spring, the history
The spirits that are there
I see it coming closer now
The picture of a place
I see myself inside the house
I'm covering my face

"

"
130857,"

Come wander with me
Come here
Come wander with me, love
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wander with me

He said ""Come wander with me, love""
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wonder with me

He came from the sunset
He came from the sea
He came from this sad world
And can love only me

Walk with love
Walk with soul
Walk with dreams
Through the cold
But I will never be free

Everybody knows
That you've been untrue
You've gone and broke my heart
And made me blue
Turned my head around
Then you tore me down

If I had a choice
I'd not be sad
'Cause when I hear your voice
It makes me glad
Baby's not around
Heard she's leaving town

Baby, baby
Don't run away
I want you to stay
I'm sorry
So sorry
I made you blue
And now you should be sorry too
Should be sorry too

Now I'm so alone
You're far away
I sit here at home
No words to say
To anyone around
'Cause you tore me down
You tore me down
Tore me down
Tore me down

"
131651,"

I can't hide the way I feel inside
I just gotta say it's you makes me feel this way
So come with me, we'll take a walk down by the sea
From now on you'll be the only girl for me
We got no time for things gone by
For foolish tears we cried
I can't hide

You can't hide the way you feel for me
I can read your eyes and I like what I see
It's there so plain, it's just for you my love is free
Hold me close now girl and keep on lovin' me
We can't stop now to think about the past
We're moving too fast

Yesterday my life was filled with pain
But now it's changed, we'll never be the same
We're together now
We can never say goodbye
I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide

"
131652,
131653,
131654,"

[Verse 1]
Don't tell lies
You can't keep goin' on
This way
Realize
It's no good puttin' on
Your friends
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

[Bridge]
You think you're smart
But you just contradict
All that you say

[Chorus]
Don't put me on
It puts me off
You've had your fun
I've had enough

[Verse 2]
From the start
I knew you'd miss the point
I've had enough
So I'll just smoke a joint

[Chorus]
Don't put me on
It puts me off
You've had your fun
I've had enough

[Interlude]
Wow!

[Verse 3]
One chance I'm told
And that is all
Poltroons
Like you I've known
Vacant and cold
God save your soul

"
131655,"

I called the doctor
Up in the morning
I had a fever
It was a warning
She said ""There's nothing I can prescribe
To keep your raunchy bag of bones alive""
I got some money left for one more shot
She said ""God bless you"" I said ""Thanks a lot""

It's a slow, slow death

I called the preacher
Holy, holy
I begged forgiveness
That's when he told me
He said ""There's nothing I can prescribe
To keep your raunchy bag of bones alive""
I got some money left for one more shot
He said ""God bless you"" I said ""Thanks a lot""

[Chorus/instrumental break]

I got to mainline
A hit of morphine
It's set to mainline
It's like a bad dream
Slow death... eat my mind away
Slow death... turn my guts to clay
Slow death [repeated]
Yeah, yeah [repeated]

"
131656,"

I will find a way
To get to you some day
Oh, but I, babe, I'm so afraid I'll fall, yeah
Now can't you hear me call?

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
I'm sure that's all you need
To make it all right

It's taken me so long
To get where I belong
Oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah
For I will make you pay

(refrain)
If you don't dig what I say
Then I will go away
And I won't come back this again. No
'Cause I don't need a friend

(refrain)

"
131657,
131658,"

I'm a monster
Got a revved-up teenage head
Teenage monster
California born and bred
Half a boy and half a man
I'm half at sea and half on land, oh my
Bye-bye

Got a woman
She's my hopped-up high-school queen
She's my woman
She's a teenage love machine
She knows how to turn me on
And get me high and get it on and on
Yeah, she does

When you see me
Better turn your tail and run
'Cause I'm angry
And I'll mess you up for fun
I'm a child of atom bombs
And rotten air and Vietnams, I'm you
You are me

I was brought to this planet
Carrying light inside, only place to confide
Was right there in the mirror as I took a glimpse behind the darkness in my eyes

And I've tried to understand, the feeling in my soul as I comprehend
That I am just a visitor to this land, and I will stand at the center of the dark cause it is my plan

To bring light to the void, my higher self down to a world that destroys
Where unconditional love they avoid
Diminishing darkness with the sound of my voice

We are the light of heaven, and the darkness of Earth
And I know I've been seeking my higher self since my birth
We are the light of heaven, and the darkness of Earth
And I know I've been seeking my higher self since my birth

""I remember when I'd dream
Picturing a life I know I could be living, but it seems I have to play these cards that I've been given
Cause giving up just ain't an option, its often, that I'm being tested by the actions that I'm offering
In the face of contrast to who I truly am, I've replaced the past and now I have a new plan
I've faced the mask in the mirror and its clearer that my soul has been in fear of entering this new land
Now I stand up on a higher ground, I am now, thankful for the wisdom and the knowledge that my soul has found
And I am bound to a higher way
Fly away to a new realm where I have found that I am wide awake
I see the truth for what it is, I coexist, in a density that's filled with bliss, and I know that I'll find a way
To stay, in these stars, where truth is alive in the whole and the parts
I am just feeling it, there is no ceiling if, there is no end cause this cycle restarts
We are just nearing it, only thing steering it, are conscious thoughts sent from light years afar
Now fade in from the start, eleven eleven, becoming one with the dark
Shine light on the night that's my part
Times right to take flight in these stars, in these stars

And the universe taught me as I was drifting, above my own body, creating divisions
From what I believed, and what my spirit has been learning
As the lantern of truth inside ignited and began burning

Breathe in. Breathe out. Yeah
Breathe in. Breathe out, Yeah
You can feel it now

Breathe in breathe out, you can feel it now, this is how we find ourselves amongst a new place in the clouds
Crowds, of other beings I'm seeing start guiding us, likened us to three dimensional stars who brighten up
When we overcome, what has been holding us back, keeping us trapped, and thinking we don't have it intact
We see that we are all one and complete
Just stars, just stars with a heart beat

Stars with a heartbeat

When we overcome, what has been holding us back, keeping us trapped, and thinking we don't have it intact
We see that we are all one and complete
Just stars, stars with a heart beat

It could be the perspective I've selected, after lives of experiences collected
Projected right onto a new dream
A story created with scenes, when I pull the strings as I've directed
So I bring attention, to the way that life flows
Endless dimensions of geometrical light shows
Inviting those with an open heart to take part, cause they might know they're attending as a wise soul

And that's the start, of a brand new way of breathing
We're greeting a higher energy, and oxygen's increasing
I've been seeking, for a new vibe I have been reaching, growing wiser of my past as a future Pleiadian
In these stars
Yeah, in these stars

And the one thing that connects it all
Just an atom in every place limited by no law
Watching the rise and fall, of sound energies, up and down a synergy of frequencies that makes life start

And I'm feeling it, and I'm feeling it now
And I'm wiling it, and I'm willing it now
Take me back to the stars beyond these clouds
Take me back to the stars

This light is shining through, and it's time to do
Not a thing but find a new, synchronicity that's trying to
Show your soul a sign or two
When it's just reminding you
Of the star inside and the light is just the blinding proof

When we overcome, what has been holding us back, keeping us trapped, and thinking we don't have it intact
We see that we are all one and complete
Just stars, stars with a heart beat.""

""I'm discovering god, I'm breaking down the facade
I'm discovering god, and I know that we are not flawed

I look beyond the veil and see the patterns unfold
Reflecting the light of my soul, and the whole
Of my being is receiving the knowledge that's being channeled
From my past lives light years ago. And I know

The unity contained in the whole
Of the hologram and all of its parts
Knowing no end and no start
Expanding beyond limitations with love
That's been sent from my heart

Uh, and it all exists
Everything that I can visualize
I just feel the vibes, then become it inside
Materialize it right in front of my eyes
I open up my mind, and I'm finding the light
And when the timing is right, I know my spirit will rise
Never will hide, never will die
Immortal cause I know that I'm forever alive

I'm god
She's god
He's god
We're god

I'm discovering god, I'm breaking down the facade
I'm discovering god, and I know that we are not flawed

This frequency is so high
Becoming one as our atoms collide
Two energies both attracted through vibes, tonight
I'm feeling connected inside, and I know it's right

Open up a new gateway, as new thoughts from the all that is
Begin to make way
And they can't manifest in the same way
All limitations have no choice but to vacate

Exposed as I let go
Of previous ways of thinking. I've been mingling
With other life and energy whose dialects
Leave both of my ears ringing
I've been dreaming

Of a remedy for your enemy complex
And all your energy that simply dissects
Just open up to the light, no need to fight
And allow the sleeping god that's inside to resurrect

I'm discovering god, I'm breaking down the facade
I'm discovering god, and I know that we are not flawed
I'm discovering god, I'm breaking down the facade
I'm discovering god, so much more than what we've been taught

And I have seen we are all connected, visions of the all that is
That have been projected
Every energy is just one, and I've just begun to find the truth
My soul's requested

The moment's here, no more fear
New dimensions will appear
When you listen to your inner self you make it all clear

Open up your heart and your mind
You will not be left behind
Connection to the god inside, you will find

Yeah
Connection to the god inside, you will find

This frequency is so high
Becoming one as our atoms collide
Two energies both attracted through vibes, tonight
Feeling connected inside, cause I know it's right

Open up a new gateway, as new thoughts from the all that is
Begin to make way
And they can't manifest in the same way
All limitations have no choice but to vacate

Now I'm vibing, feel the psilocybin
Entering my body and I know that I'm arriving
In a place where I finally feel alive when
The veil lifts and I see the source that I confide in
The darkness inside, that I have been fighting
Is striking through my veins reminiscent of the lightning
That I see up in the sky in this night reflecting off the moonlight
My true path and I'm reminded

I'm god
She's god
He's god
We're god

We're god, yeah uh we're god

I'm god
She's god
He's god
We're god
We are not flawed, like once we thought.""

"
133079,"

Wake up, and I've realized that I've denied who I really was
My whole life I have tried to let me ego die and just rise above
There is no love, if you don't allow it
I know I am enough but right now my spirit's ungrounded

The doubt is just caving in, it's amazing when I'm feeling at the end
It's only light I wanna be taking in, as I'm gazing in, to the thoughts I've sent
Uh, and how could it be, that I didn't see, my heart would retreat
In the presence of fear I appeared to flee, as I backed away from my destiny

But now, I know I'm alive, my body will rise, blend with the skies
To hell with your lies, I am not blind, I see your disguise

We are all one and connected, and lately I've been feeling tempted
To let go of all of the wreckage, that the powers in this world have projected

There is no room for the fear
Age of divisions is finally here
Reminiscing on each one of my tears
The intuition's been inside me for years

This world is not how it appears
Disconnection is nothing but a lie
Believing that this is all real
Inhibits your spirit from feeling alive

Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending
Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending

Old structures breaking down, being ruptured from my crown
Chakra opening, can't handle this new energy that's been floating in
Responding to the sounds of all these beings I have found
And I'm knowing them, to release all of these concepts they've been holding in

I'm growing when I start listening, to the subtle voices inside
And knowing that they've been whispering, but it's up to me to decide

And that's why, I ignite the fire, find a new way of living that'll bring me higher
On the mountain of destiny, amounting to see the full self that I have aspired

To be in my dreams when I'm leaving, my body right here for the astral plane
Records of the Akash I am seeing cause the future, the present, the past is the same

Eleven eleven the time is right now in this moment
Follow the dreams in your heart, if you are alive then you have been chosen

This is my journey, this is no destination
But I am not returning to a life that is complacent
This is my journey, this is no destination
But I am not returning to a life that is complacent

There is no room for the fear
Age of divisions is finally here
Reminiscing on each one of my tears
The intuition's been inside me for years

This world is not how it appears
Disconnection is nothing but a lie
Believing that this is all real
Inhibits your spirit from feeling alive

There is no room for the fear
Age of divisions is finally here
Reminiscing on each one of my tears
The intuition's been inside me for years

Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending
Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending

""A new universe that I'm making
No more waiting
Spent lifetimes in thought contemplating
Now I'm taking
My place as my true self, no one else
Could envision the divine visions
That my soul has been creatin'

Hesitation keeps you where you are
Manifestations are staying so far
Of a distance if you listened to your heart
Then you'd be reminiscing face to face with the God
That's inside of you

You're blinded to, your power so I am reminding you
It's time for truth and to discover who
Your true self is and to become a new

Never will I have to live a lie, cause what's inside
Is nothing but the truth keeping me alive
I confide, in my spirit when I hear it calling me
From what I've been fearing creeping in my mind

Stop time. Now I'm living in the now
Meditating no more waiting
I ain't worried about how
Cause I'm living in this moment
And my thoughts are so potent
That I'm sitting back knowing
It'll come if I allow

Projecting frequencies of what my higher self desires
Transcending from my ego, like a phoenix from this fire
New dimensions that I'm shifting through
Where my higher self is all that I listen to
Guide me down my soul's path
That will always last
Bring the truth to my life like my visions do
I open my whole soul up
To feeling new ways being sent from above, it's because
I never once believed in luck, always living this life as I'm channeling love

Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to drop the doubts

Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to live the now

I know who's here
I know who's listening
I will destroy all of these fears you have been witnessing

A new path that's created in this presence
Channel this energy right from our divine essence

All these vibrations emanating, creating
The life that you know you're here to live
You've been given a gift
And I know that it's hard to see
When your soul's been surrounded by nothing
But these fallacies

Leave them where they are, and move forward
It's only light and truth that you're moving towards
Break out of your shell, be your true self
No more hell
You no longer have to feel cornered
Just leave the past behind, redefine
Who you are in the present
Use the past as a lesson
Transform to the heart from the mind
Give it time, and find the answers to your questions

Every single one that your ego hides
Makes it hard to see all the truth inside
Governed by the light, buried deep inside
Exposed only when your universe collides
With that of your higher being
Future self in the mirror you'll be meeting
Open your senses up cause you're reaching
For your soul's very own expanded teachings
Now I'm leaving, those patterns and thoughts
That created my unconscious life
And I'm believing, that it happened this way
Just to bring me right back to the light

Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to drop the doubts

Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to live the now

The frequencies which I resonate with
Frequently appear cause they made it
Through space and time, sent from my mind
Every moment I live I know I've created
And it's always changing, symbols in a dream
Just rearranging
And new thoughts just came in
Focused on my pineal gland's vibration

It's because I'm attracting, every single moment
That has happened, I'm tapped in
To the source of action from the divine
And just living life as I imagined, and I'm asking

As I'm shifting through timelines, designed and defined
All by my higher mind
Stop time and I suddenly remind that another life I'll find
As I let my soul's truth shine

Stop time and I suddenly remind that another life I'll find
As I let my soul's truth shine

Stop time and I suddenly remind that another life I'll find.""

I see your soul right behind your eyes
A glimpse of the love your possess inside
It's confession time and I'm here to say
That I'm here to stay throughout the rest of time
And just nevermind what they thought of
When they caught us living our individual truth
And this feeling is new as it's taught us
That it's got us in a game we're not willing to lose

Future insights in the present tense
These lessons went right to my core
Opened a door, a seventh sense and now I'm feeling more
Of who we really are, and who we really were
In past lives from afar, together we've both made a third
Energy surrounding both our souls when no one else could know. Be persecuted for our truths or look into my eyes and let go
Just don't let go

And I can be your mirror
And I can be your mirror
And I can be your mirror
Just look into my eyes and see this world you live in so much clearer

And I can be your mirror. Yeah
And I can be your mirror
And I can be your mirror
Just look into my eyes and see this world you live in so much clearer

Compassion is a trait that's innately driving me
Trying to be found when it could never leave
Whether we weather this storm you'll be the one to see
Severed and torn I promise we will never be
I know it's alarming for your eyes to see but I'm here and I'm holding my ground. I feel the calming arise right inside of me
Not a fear with a whisper or a sound

We're amounting to be an energy of three
Top of the pyramid where we see galaxies
Align with our hearts and our minds
These symbols and signs say only love we will find
In a bond that's defined, only by the divine
In a bond that's defined, only by the divine

You only see in others what you see in yourself
You only see in others what you see in yourself

Outlines of auras move toward us
Forward us to a new plane
And poured us from our lives into the light like the sky gives away its rain
Living this life time to bring some change
Ordained to a new level free of all devils and pain
And the same things that you hide away from
Take some time, you will find, for your mind to escape

When we give away our truth for the lies
We're just increasing all the borderlines
Between who we are and what the outside thinks
So don't set sail where you know you will sink
Think not with your mind just use your heart to choose
Don't be blind and try to prove
Let your soul escape the confines of their rules

And I can be your mirror
And I can be your mirror
Mirror
Mirror
Mirror
Life is a mirror, mirror, mirror

Setbacks just don't last
It's the past that we've known that is leaving us so fast
No lag to the new, cause the present is true and we ain't going back, no relapse
Just ask and I'll let you know
The stories in my eyes will reveal my soul
Cause together we don't have to lose control or play into roles knowing we're both whole
And now you know, the love I feel
Our hearts combine in this energy field
Only place to go is just up from here
Unconditional love is just all that's real
You know I love everything you are
A being of love that has traveled far
You've opened up my heart and left your spirit's mark
And together we both become a single star

You only see in others what you see in yourself
You only see in others what you see in yourself

""I just have so many questions, and lessons to be learned
Constantly I'm being tested by a world that took a turn
In the wrong direction, when I thought I couldn't lose
Feeling the suppression of everything that I believed was true
Who? Can save me now, play it down, it's amazing how
You. Can say it loud and break it down, but it's just not getting through
I want a change, tired of the blame, giving up the pain, I'm due
For a new plane where my thoughts are the same as the wrong I'm born into
I'm feeling the shadow inside arise, taking on a new form where it's manifesting right before my eyes
I have tried to hold it back, and been too afraid to ask
All of these lies have built my past, when will I remove this mask?

Yeah, and I just wanna feel connected, haven't felt the light in so long, I've been scared that I'll forget it
Yeah. and I just wanna feel connected, haven't felt the light in so long, I've been scared that I'll forget it

So what do I do when there's no place I can run, surely I do not belong here this is not where I am from
I am done, with conforming, I'm transforming, no more numb
Feelings from the cold I feel from the eclipsing of the sun
I've wondered why, we live in all these lies, I have to change this world because there isn't time to simply try
The thunder cries, and then my soul becomes alive
Opening up a new world letting the old one die

And from this world I know I wanna flee
Take me back to the other home of my soul the Pleiades
And from this world I know I wanna flee
Take me back to the other home of my soul the Pleiades

Yeah, the Pleiades

These hallways that I'm walking are so dark, but I know that I am here to play my part, and make my mark
Because I know that I'm a being of the light, and I will keep on moving through the darkness of the night, I know what's in my sights

Yeah, and do you know the reason? Why this world is stuck in winter without a change of the seasons?
Yeah, and do you know what we could feel? I promise you the dark and cold is only half of what is real

It's only half of what is real. It's only half of what it real
Yeah, and do you know what we could feel? I promise you the dark and cold is only half of what is real

And I don't know if I will ever find my way out, I'm amazed how, this thunder keeps on coming just never fades out
Will I break down, or will I fake doubt, a new choice I'm a have to make now
A new voice I'm a create now, the innate sounds of my escape route

I feel it now and I'm floating, old thoughts I am eroding, hoping for a new wave that's flowing, my mind is open and my aura's glowing, I'm growing, expanding, now I'm showin', that I'm demanding my inner knowing
Holding myself accountable for the planting of the seeds that I've been sowing
Knowing that life as I've lived it on this planet's cold, but I know my part and truly understand my spirit's role
I've got my guides, and my oversoul
Connecting my heart to these feelings my mind could never know

Yeah, and do you know the reason? Why this world is stuck in winter without a change of the seasons
Yeah, and do you know what we could feel? I promise you the dark and cold is only half of what is real

And from this world I know I wanna flee
Take me back to the other home of my soul the Pleiades


And from this world I know I wanna flee
Take me back to the other home of my soul the Pleiades.""

"
133083,"

I am that mix-breeded, star-seeded individual
Tripping on that residual DMT drippin from my pineal
Aligned with cosmic forces, I know the source is
Flowing through my soul, and to shed light on this earth is my goal, yeah
Foresight, three eyes, tonight, shivai
Create a vibration with my thoughts, I'm a god
And I will live my life anyway in which I decide
It's my design, this is where the dark and the light both reside
Eternally building my life with my heart in tune with my mind I go inside

Feel it resonating, waiting on no time
Present moment's got me focused on the divine
Deep breaths make the kundalini rise
And I become alive, as my chakras align

And you're focused on time? Well I'm livin this moment
And you're stuck in your mind? But don't it feel hopeless?

Yea, and I know you're tired of the fear
Open up your heart and bring all of your dreams here
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai

Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
And I know you're tired of the lies, open up your heart and speak your truth

Stardust in my DNA, soul sent here from the blue ray
Stepped onto this planet, with the understanding
That nothing's gonna be the same

I'm here to change and take away the pain
This world's been a drought and I am the rain
Bring truth no doubts no fears to blame
I'm letting loose cause we're out and we're here to reign

Uh, and your mind will wane as your awareness now opens up to your heart
Part ways with destructive thoughts, allowing your soul to create a new start
And I know all these scars, are nothing but symbols of moments in time
And my journey's been far, awakened to truth I'm removing the blinds

Yea, and I know you're tired of the fear
Open up your heart and bring all of your dreams here
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai

One step at a time and I will find that I'm reaching divine
Levels of being because I've been seeing devils who have tried
And angels who have lost their wings and fallen from the skies
Caving then suppressing their truths just to live this world's lies

I am the observer, and this is duality
Life can give you hurdles, but maybe that's just how it seems
When you see it from both sides, then you know why
You're being pulled to try
Be aware that the moment is there, just to change the dark to light
And bring the day to night

Yeah, and that's why I know I am here
A star-seeded being transcending this third dimensional atmosphere
Yeah, and I know I will make my path clear
Shining light right through the front door of every home for fear

It's time to stop waiting, this is the awakening, yeah
This is the awakening
It's time to stop waiting, this is the awakening, yeah
This is our awakening

Out of sight, I'm in 5D
Turn the dark to the light when thoughts become reality
Take flight, lose the gravity
It's yourself you fight, when you place limits on your beliefs

Transforming these energies, I tend to see, that it's meant to be
That my light's shining on this darkness
Bringing endings to this planet's duality

In the depths of my soul I know, I will reap everything I've sown
With the death of my human ego, I'm watching my whole spirit grow

It's breaking out, and it's breaking free
Taking me to a new understanding
When I've landed in a world with branded
Identities of who you should be

Let me show you what we could see
Let me show you what we could be
Open your eyes, all three
Quiet your mind, let's dream

Eleven eleven, the time is right now in this moment
This moment, right here in this moment
Eleven eleven, the time is right now in this moment
This moment, right here in this moment

Yea, and I know you're tired of the fear
Open up your heart and bring all of your dreams here
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai

Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth

Yeah, eleven eleven
The time is right now in this moment
This moment
Right here in this moment

Eleven eleven
The time is right now in this moment
This moment
Right here in this moment

Discover and become yourself
Discover and become yourself, you're not here to be someone else

Discover and become yourself
Discover and become yourself, you're not here to be someone else

Baby gave us away today
She broke my heart
I can't beg her to stay this time

I wanna go right out and find a girl
It's been a long time and I'm seeing the world
Through different eyes
Through different eyes

Oh baby, I ain't begging but I feel like dancing
And would you let a city boy
Hold hands with you?
I wanna get to know you

I never thought of myself as tied down
But I was so much in love
But this girl I loved, she put me down
I need someone new, someone who's
Gonna make my heart jump the way she use to do

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
I think I'm falling in love again
All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
They make me glad I'm a man, I said
All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
I think I'm fallin' in love, that's right

I take a green eyed girl, she's going to the square
I'll take a chance, although I ain't going nowhere
But I wanna go
I wanna go too

I'll take a north end girl, her parents ain't home
We watching TV and we're all alone
And I wanna know
All kindsa girls

I never thought I'd see the day
She'd turn her back on me
But my baby gets her way today
I need someone new, someone who's
Gonna make my heart jump the way she use to do

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
I think I'm falling in love again
All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
They make me glad I'm a man, I said

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
I feel so good inside
All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
I'm so happy just to be alive when I see

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls
All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls

I was good to my girl for so long
She broke my heart and she done me wrong
So I'm out on the street and I open my eyes
I see these things, but to my surprise
I ain't seen before

I want some more, some love
I want some love

Oh girl, a real girl, girl
Oh, she broke my heart
I'm ready for a new start on love
Oh, here I go

Oh yeah

Look myself in the mirror
And I promise I’m complacent of the man that looks back
But I can’t stand the fact that he’s hiding from himself
And I can’t stand the act that he plays and he tells let em know

Let em know, let em know, let em know
What you know, what you know, what you know
Let em know, let em know, let em know
Let em know

We can never be what we wanna be
Cuz you will never believe the lies I speak
Let me open up just to put you down
Let me sober up I swear it’s just for now
Let me fall alone until I hit the ground
The man I’ve become wouldn’t make you proud
And I fall, and I fall
To the life we found

Never been afraid of a choice I made
Till the walls would cave in on all that I’ve known
All our mistakes and our fall from grace
Got me out of place in the place in the place I call home

Should I question allegiance?
Don’t ask this man for his reasons
When the people that you love tryna spill ya blood
Over nothing but a pair of sneakers

How far we’ve come but how low we’ll go
Grew up too young like we failed to grow
Too brave to run too dumb to leave
Watch a man fall apart taking more than he needs

I was caught in the wire before I walked through the fire
We all fall to desire every king was once a liar
You know what you know cuz I want you to know it
Plan my next move and refuse to show it
Cease the moment and hold it
Cuz everything that got you where you stand
Probably contradicts everything that you believe in as a man

Here I am in disgust I ain't proud of what I’ve done
I ain't askin for forgiveness for the sins that I’ve committed
Cuz there’s morals then there’s business there’s survival of the fittest Truth is the life I’m living ain't the life I envisioned

We can never be what we wanna be
Cuz you will never believe the lies I speak
Let me open up just to put you down
Let me sober up I swear it’s just for now
Let me fall alone until I hit the ground
The man I’ve become wouldn’t make you proud
And I fall, and I fall
To the life we found

No crowns without blood wish life was bout love
My perspective ain't what it should be
Climb the mountain drink from the fountain
Still you’ll never be what you could be
Swear I’m living wrong
Swear the days too dark and the nights too long
Waiting for the dawn
Didn’t choose the path that we’re on

Holding on to moments gone could you forgive the things I’ve wronged I’m holding on to moments lost I’m holding on to all that you’ve forgot

We can never be what we wanna be
Cuz you will never believe the lies I speak
Let me open up just to put you down
Let me sober up I swear it’s just for now
Let me fall alone until I hit the ground
The man I’ve become wouldn’t make you proud
And I fall, and I fall
To the life we found

If god don’t like me strike me where I stand
Cuz the money in your wallet don’t make the man
Cuz the pain that you swallow’s never part the plan
Middle finger to tomorrow cuz here I am
Here I remain hoping that the truth doesn’t hurt
For the moment just ease the pain
Embrace the rain knowing that no matter how hard we try
We all miss the train
Maybe that’s the way life’s supposed to be
Living to impress but deaths standing close to me
Fell short of the man that I hoped to be
Tugging on the past cuz I’m tryna catch the ghost of me
Too far to see too high to crash
Searching for a purpose in an empty glass
Searching for a virgin not a piece of ass
Sipping on the bourbon from the devil’s Flask

I'm telling you baby that I’m caught in the middle
Between the life that you gave me and the life behind the pistol
Don’t you worry bout tomorrow cuz tonight is a party
And we’d rather fall in love with ourselves then somebody

Perception, perfection, anything that you want just mention
Anything for a false impression like
Hey I’m looking for a woman to invest in
Call me crazy might be faded often baby want it take it
Falling lately no one makes it
Swear you made me get you naked
Make a statement let’s crack the pavement
What’s a plan to a man who told fate we’re changing
From the gutter to greatness never stay complacent
Let’s own the night let’s take what’s taken
I’m contemplating sick of waiting
Sick of sleeping while the dream’s awake
And I swear I’m leaving if nothing’s changing
Embrace the weekend if tonight’s amazing

Baby, baby, baby, baby, help me lose control
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don’t spend the night alone

I'm telling you baby that I’m caught in the middle
Between the life that you gave me and the life behind the pistol
Don’t you worry bout tomorrow cuz tonight is a party
And we’d rather fall in love with ourselves then somebody

Maybe time heals pain but time destroys his vision
Fuck depression of reflection punching holes in his image
Society is probably fire feeding the furnace
See success is never given to those who deserve it

If losing is learning I guess I’m merging paths with Einstein
If death relieves the burden guess I’m cutting lifelines
Whens the right time? To turn a choice to decision
I think this world can be different, if the world would just stop and listen

Not to poets, life coaches, but that voice in your head
Some people happy they land owners when theyíre living in sheds
Some people live like stock brokers but live alone without friends
For my ideas teared apart I curse the world from my room
Why should i reach for the stars when I get high to the moon
Am I speaking too soon? My mind’s defying my age
I fear no man on this earth but I’m afraid of the stage

And people locked in a cage would hear my words and just laugh
Theoretically my enemy’s the perspective I have
If god shows wrath can the devil be kind?
I believe that choice sets a future leave my past here to die

Life’s got plans we’ve been dying since birth
A simple man could have his claws on the earth
I’m reaching but not feeling
I’m speaking hardly breathing
The world falls through the ceiling but still I’m not leaving
I’m not leaving
Alone

If heavens promised to a christian our illusion is trust
They say we’re losing our religion but religions losing us
And what’s a god to a man without direction or cause
Who’s the pawn to the plan if destiny has been lost

What is wrong in the hands of the preachers and saints
Could be righteous under eye lids of creations mistakes
Walking over our fate expression’s killing the suburbs
And while we conquer debates, humans conquer each other

We live like kings in the gutter
Crowns were drowned in the sewer
Success was my lover but see my actions abused her
And I’ll crawl back to love her cuz I don’t wanna lose her

And every dream of the future has the world at my feet
For my doubts spreading rumors said my throne was a seat
Spent time alone with defeat we shared a drink to the past
Said the memories turned enemies to stones in my path

They say that changing is hard, guess I’m considered a dreamer
But how could we learn from our scars if they can’t be seen in the mirror my failure’s my teacher
And my spark for revenge
I’ve been learning I’m the very thing I’m fighting against

Life’s got plans we’ve been dying since birth
A simple man could have his claws on the earth
I’m reaching but not feeling
I’m speaking hardly breathing
The world falls through the ceiling but still I’m not leaving
I’m not leaving
Alone

When the world has gone crazy
And it's all becoming clear
When they're gunning down our comrades
And it seems the end is near
As they're loading up the launchers
For the tear gas grenades
We can take off our bandanas (for a moment)
And kiss behind the barricades

When it's madness all around
You can see this at a glance
We will cry and we will sing
And we will laugh and we will dance
As they shout their marching orders
Beneath the helicopter blades
We will seize the moment
For a kiss behind the barricades

They will try to break our spirit
And at times they may succeed
But our love for the world
Is stronger than their greed
When the building is surrounded
And hope begins to fade
In my final hour
A kiss behind the barricades

As the movement grows
There will be hills and bends
But at the center of the struggle
Are your lovers and your friends
The more we hold each other up
The less we can be swayed
Here's to love and solidarity
And a kiss behind the barricades

All the young girls look like ravens
As they flock around the pool
And they peck at their reflection
In the shadows of men's drool
I could look out there forever
Forever has no holes
Through the windows of eternity
You can glimpse the passing souls
This party's over
The bells are ringing themselves
I'm going home

She was standing on the table
With a message on her skin
I'm a look right in her eyes
But I could not see in
I have loved you from a distance
Loved you from up close
Like the tiny frog that breathes
I can nestle in your cloak
This party's over
The bells are ringing themselves
And I'm going home

I was always in a hurry
But I never knew what for
Paranoia chased me out
And then time just closed the door
Now the party's over
The drugs are taking themselves
And I'm going home

At the end of every week
They flood into our streets
Homogenized and oh so bleak
Got a hall pass from your job
Just to act like a fucking slob
Save 16 bricks for the façade

I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend

They were made for the working stiff
With a two day fun permit
Let loose like our life depends on it
At the end of every week
You're screaming in our streets
Work hard, play hard, business elite

I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend

Paint the rainbow shades of beige
Take down everything we made
The neighborhood walks home afraid
Cause they were made for the working stiff
With a two day fun permit
Let loose like your life depends on it

I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend

Hate from the basement
Hate from the insecure
When you're anonymous
No consequence to fear
Your place is so low
Human mosquito
No conversation only vitriol

What place do you have
What place do you have
What face do you have
What face do you have

Would you or wouldn't you
Nothing of value
The dregs, the tiresome
Dumbed down for everyone
Your mind is narrow
Your head is hollow
Caught up forever in the trivial

What place do you have
What place do you have
What face do you have
What face do you have

Your place is so low
Human mosquito
No conversation only vitriol

What place do you have
What place do you have
What face do you have
What face do you have

Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone
Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone

But I wanna talk
Talk until the neighbors knock
And I wanna move
Move the furniture around the living room
‘Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
‘Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts

Come and sit next to me, faces lit by a screen
What does it mean inside, outside reality?
I want in real life, turned on the Christmas lights
And put on a song, one that's kind of fast and kind of long
‘Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
‘Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts

Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone
Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone

But I wanna talk
Talk until the neighbors knock
Cause I wanna move, move, move
Move the furniture around the living room
‘Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
‘Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts
‘Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
‘Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts

Some girls just got it all wrong
At the show just to go home with a guy
They're still calling you the rock-star lie

It's okay, go with the public demand
Free admission
Let's take a ride in your van

You just wanted a good time
For once to be in the line light
But odds are
One night is less than you've bargained for

Let's play the lipstick game tonight
One time could drive me wild baby

Ooh yah

What kind of girl do you think you are?
Don't call you groupie that's going to far
One name
One name that would suit you

You check out the next group that comes to town
Before you know it your names spread all around
Shame how
Fame
Catches up with you

Let's play the lipstick game tonight
One time could drive me wild
Push
Let's play the lipstick game tonight
One time could drive me wild baby

There are kids that only talk about what is hip, whos cool
They scream and should
The things i wish you knew are all over

When all the bands have come and gone
Well be rockin the beats, ill sing your song
If this is what you need, we got the dose

I already know whats right and wrong
Youll be stompin' your feet, that stubborn frown
The things you wish you could do over

The things you say, we laugh
We know you dont get the joke
You dont come to hear our songs, so go home

Give the kids a shot
What is it they want?

Che si dice? che su cesso?

The way things look around here

Every night
I watch from my window
The moths
Dancin round the fake moon
Sun will rise
And hit our eyes
Through tiny shutter lines
Summer time
I know why you still
Wear your winter coat
(don't want to grow)
I know why you still climb
Into other people's clothes
Wanting to preserve, but
Only stealing their bones
I grew out of mine

[Verse 1]
Alone in the dark
Is it more alone
Than alone in the light
That keeps you up at night

There's more than one reason
To hate the world spinning
To hate the world spinning

[Chorus]
Everyone hates the party
Everyone hates the party
You say you love me
Everyone hates the party

[Verse 2]
At home
Do you leave the blue screen on?
Do you watch the dots
Like everything

Please don't forget
You're something I listen to
When I'm not sleeping

Fortune grows
Where you lie the most
And time says ""today
Be afraid it's not the same
Today""

"
137837,"

Hollow eyelids
You keep me near
When you close
Low moon transparencies
Hangs on to everything
I’ll keep you warm
While you’re cooling down
My words go numb
In the AC hum

"
137838,"

Summer splinters
In the old sunny grave
Where I lay down my wires
Wanderer
Has the snow gotten you cold?
Do you remind yourself
Of the golden gazebo
Suburban glow
On your face
Like shattered glass leaves
Or the branches of the old days
Or the pot-holes of your old age

"
137839,"

Time it takes to grow old, on your porch
Is it long enough
To get over you
Summer rain brings your voice
To my ear
I'll stay up all night
Just to hear your voice
If I ask politely
Will you ask me
The question of
""who do you love?""
Who do you love
And is it enough?
Time it takes to grow old, on your porch
Is it long enough

"
137840,"

I saw my car drive past me
Got four eyes now, I can see
I was a liar, I never knew
Once you find love, it's so hard to leave
Can't wait 'til class is over
We've been here forever and ever
And you were dancing in falling leaves
Won't you come over and dance with me

You're on some kind of specialty
You wanna use my energy
Halfway gone with the radio on
But you're all wrong and the plummet's long

Do you wanna know what's real to me?
You got a patent on frailty
Halfway blissed but you're gonna miss
How you're sickened, all your weekends

Tell me did you mean that
I need to understand

Awake at all am I slipping away
Breathing fumes I can hardly use
Did we ever? I remember

Black tie sunrise
Tabloid still life
Dropped jaws poolside

Bad or worse he knows it's real
The crimson pool the camera's flashing feel
What the butler saw is likened to a movie

Welcome sirens
Wide-eyed violence

Left my car at a country bar
Pitch dark, not if you are
Long lean for the last beer's mate
Four rounds eliminated
See your face when I close my eyes
And cadavers in the taverns
Wrote a song but I'll never play it
Cause you said it and you can't unsay it

You said it and you can’t unsay it
You said it and you can’t unsay it

Old friend says I gotta go
I'm tired but not how you know
Long lean in the bathroom line
Tonight nobody gets a ride
See your face when I turn the key
Your words, the passenger seat
Clutch the tape but I cannot play it
Cause you said it and you can't unsay it

You said it and you can’t unsay it
You said it and you can’t unsay it

Oh, you're in my head
You’re in my head, when it's on
You’re in my head
You’re in my head, when it's on
It's on

Sometimes you wait for a band of sunlight to appear
Then you kick up clouds into some kind of phony atmosphere
It’s so hard to see you when you’re in the midst of a cover-up
When you’re on the take
Like a crooked cop
Like a crooked cop

You call me to the station and tell me to hand it over here
Then when no one’s looking you take it as your own souvenir
But I know what’s up and how it goes straight to the top
When you’re on the take
Like a crooked cop
Like a crooked cop

It’s hard to picture us together
Even our truer selves
When you say that you’d like to see me
I still don’t know who you’re taking your orders from

Every time I see you it still makes me sick with desire
But there are a few things that I just wouldn’t do for hire
And I tell you how I feel but I know you’re wearing a wire
Cause you’re on the take
Like a crooked cop
Like a crooked cop

Throw disintegrating melodies

I was thinking about truth
Ahh, it's not automatic

This night drives me wild, ahh, row away
It's like I'm untied, ahh, row you say?
Well I want to make sense with you
And I want to make sense with you

You say something, I stop the bus
And I'll see you in the morning when the light's up
I was drinking the dew

Take care golden hair, draw me a sky
Paint me in a picture with a new face
I'm a body of dreams for you, ahh
I'm a body of dreams for you, ahh
I'm a body of dreams for you, ahh
I'm a dirty attic

One bite won't kill the killer
But it sends a message
One sniff can't kid a kidder
But you'll learn a lesson
One prick won't bleed you dry
But he can be a real thorn in your fucking side
One kick won't make you cry
In the moment
But maybe later

Hey Manfish you're barely even there
I can see your cookie crumble and it's harder and harder to care
My poor fins are falling off like your hair
And I can't swim down to the sweepings
But dogfish wants none of it now
He needs all of it somehow

One step to go outside
But you can't commit
One click to change the channel
When you're sick of dog shit
One slip to blow your fucking brains out on the floor
To use a metaphor
One tear won't make a difference
When you're in the water

Hey Manfish you're fading in and out
I can see your chickens hatching and there’s not very many to count
My poor fins are falling off like your hair
But I still swim down to the sweepings
Cuz dogfish wants none of it now
He needs all of it somehow

"
138035,"

Well I can tell you'd make a cannon of a guy
So put the pistol away
Your big old blow up only bores me at best
But your buzzing brightens my day

You make a face like someone asked you about your day
And you don't know where to start

So feed me poison make me feel like I could fight
An army in Ancient Greece
And give me boxing gloves and tell me that my armchair
Is a fucking theif

I'll make a face like someone asked me about my week
And I don't remember a thing
C'est la vie

La di da di da

I'll make a face like someone asked me about my week
And I don't remember a thing
C'est la vie

"
138036,"

Oh if there's one thing in life you can be sure of
It's that you will certainly die and so will everyone you love
Take the time to ask important stuff
Like have I done and have I dared
And don't forget this one right here

Does your ghost haunt the land where you took your last stand?
Does your soul patrol the shop where your heart went and stopped?
Does your specter haunt the sector where you gave your last lecture?
Or does it go back home?

Well my body won't sleep and my mouth won't eat
Cuz I have too much to think about and so much more to see
Hey Mr. Postman, could you take a seat?
I have a very funny question shut your fucking mouth and listen to me

Does your ghost haunt the land where you took your last stand
Does your soul patrol the shop where your heart went and stopped
Does your essence have a presence where you learned your last lesson
Or does it go back home?

Does your ghost haunt the land where you took your last stand
Does your soul patrol the shop where your heart went and stopped
Does your essence have a presence where you learned your last lesson

Or does it go back home?

"
138037,"

Bury me in the hall
And visit me all year long
Squeeze my head till blood explodes from both my ears
And I'd still hear your song

If I could melt my body down
I'd use it to finish your carousel

And if I was a man on the moon of a planet
And I was completely alone
The same sun would rise
That shatters my bones
And calls me home

Last year I lost my mind
But you kept it till I wanted it back
Strange how my hands feel incomplete
When they only thing they feel is themselves
And themselves feel cracked

If I could melt my body down
I'd use it to finish your carousel

And if I was a man on the moon of a planet
And I was completely alone
The same sun would rise
That shatters my bones
And catches your eyes
Which turn me to stone

And I'm paralyzed
Catatonicized

I've got a vibrator suitcase
I take it everywhere I go
I don't want any displace
My husband, he don't know

She said I need a vacation
Somewhere really far away
Take me to the station
What matters is I can't, I can't, stay

Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Pack it up, pack it, pack it up

She says the nights get so lonely
All I need is whats inside
Please turn off the TV
Let the ? arrive

She said I need a vacation
Somewhere really far away
Take me to the station
What matters is I can't, I can't stay

Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Pack it up, pack it, pack it up

Forgot my underwear
Forgot my socks
Nothing to brush my hair

Don't need no underwear
I got no socks
Nothing to brush my hair
All I need is, all I want is

                                      SCENE. – Elsinore.

                                                ACT III

                                              Scene I

                              Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

   KING OF DENMARK
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

  ROSENCRANTZ
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
But from what cause he will by no means speak.

  GUILDENSTERN
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.

  GETRUDE THE QUEEN
Did he receive you well?

  ROSENCRANTZ
Most like a gentleman.

  GUILDENSTERN
But with much forcing of his disposition.

  ROSENCRANTZ
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.

  GETRUDE THE QUEEN
Did you assay him
To any pastime?

  ROSENCRANTZ
Madam, it so fell out that certain players
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are here about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.

  POLONIUS
'Tis most true;
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
To hear and see the matter.

  KING OF DENMARK
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclin'd.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights.

  ROSENCRANTZ
We shall, my lord.

                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  KING OF DENMARK
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia.
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
That thus he suffers for.

  GETRUDE THE QUEEN
I shall obey you;
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.

  OPHELIA
Madam, I wish it may.

                                                   [Exit Queen.]

  POLONIUS
Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The Devil himself.

  KING OF DENMARK
[aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
O heavy burthen!

  POLONIUS
I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.

                                      [Exeunt King and Polonius].

Enter Hamlet.

  HAMLET
To be, or not to be that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die to sleep.
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death-
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememb'red.

  OPHELIA
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?

  HAMLET
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

  OPHELIA
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray you, now receive them.

  HAMLET
No, not I!
I never gave you aught.

  OPHELIA
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

  HAMLET
Ha, ha! Are you honest?

  OPHELIA
My lord?

  HAMLET
Are you fair?

  OPHELIA
What means your lordship?

  HAMLET
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

  OPHELIA
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?

  HAMLET
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.

  OPHELIA
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

  HAMLET
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you not.

  OPHELIA
I was the more deceived.

  HAMLET
Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?

  OPHELIA
At home, my lord.

  HAMLET
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.

  OPHELIA
O, help him, you sweet heavens!

  HAMLET
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.

  OPHELIA
O heavenly powers, restore him!

  HAMLET
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
they are. To a nunnery, go.

Exit.

  OPHELIA
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

Enter King and Polonius.

  KING OF DENMARK
Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
With variable objects, shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

  POLONIUS
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
But if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him; or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

  KING OF DENMARK
It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

Exeunt.

Wrapped around her skin so tight
Clings to her through the night
Drawing eyes and looking sharp
Cuts right into my beating heart

It says for you to come here
It draws you near
She whispers in your ear

You didn't care for expectations
When I'd try and call you out
She's held together with glue
She'll never disagree with you

Nothing you do can make her squirm
A girl you can buy and own
You can love with every bone

Plastic love, basically real
Plastic love, so agreeable

You can hide her in your closet

I saw you in a dream
I woke up from a scream
You glowed pink and green
Death stare and laser beams

I saw you late at night
You gave me quite a fright
I knew it was you then in 1987

Princess Castle 1987
Princess Castle, I'll see you in heaven
Princess Castle 1987
I hope we meet again

When he's mad he always lets it show

My scorpio likes total control

You are so cool
Will you pick me up after school
Will you hold me tight
Will you be with me tonight
We met at the fry shack
You were wearing all black
My favorite color's pink
What will you think
When you meet my mom
When you meet my cat
Will you still love me when I get fat

Doo wah doo diddy dum dum

Doo wah doo diddy dum dum

Doo wah doo diddy dum dum

You make me cry
No matter how hard I try
You won't be mine
I guess I crossed the line
No I don't want
Anybody else
You're the only one I want
Yeah you're the best

139106,
139107,"

Luminescent stains of the wasp splayed so yellow and benign
Never had a fighting chance
The true definition of a sad state of affairs

Pregnant with hope
A fever running hot against the wind
Only to end up
Painted thin against the glass against the frame
Feeling aimless to an end

I hope this glance is a trigger for you
An urge with couldn't subside
Refletion of every seedy desire
Cannonading through placid eyes

The first venture
A meddling tepid toe dip towards a pulse
Seeking danger seemed so modest
We lost sight as the tensions thickened
Aquiescing to carnal thought
Each furtive letter a crumbling brick
Peeled back the wings of the crippled insect
Blindly shattered in one fell swoop
This hand grenade detonates with the pinpull of truth

I hope this glance is a trigger for you
An urge with couldn't subside
Refletion of every seedy desire
Cannonading through placid eyes
This is a trigger
This is despair
These eyes are poision
A sad state of affairs
(Nothing ends well with a start like this)

"
139108,"

An incision, sliced dry-
Release the prisions from the hell of your mind
Flood out, poisioning
Pestilence on every loved living thing
Cold snap, lonely breath
Binding tightly to whatever is left
Rattled cages, broken bones
A plague lit path to every road that you roam

Avengement, avengement
It will find you and eat you up alive
Avengement

Scrying mirror, holding weight-
Behold the glass will show the scenes of this fate
Every junction you may turn
Sent up in flames as I grin while you burn

Avengement, avengement
It will find you and eat you up alive
Avengement
Should you ever see this face again
Run fast and far past every bend

"
139109,"

[Verse 1]
House full of angled mirrors
Navigate as forms bend shift and change
Stretched thin, cracked glass reflection
Sent back from which you once remained

[Verse 2]
Unable to decipher
Traits and facets - fun-house antics
Paths and shadows lead way to stagnance
Not so fun now, constant imbalance

[Bridge]
I'm found and lost
Distorted and shaped
In vision and action we can not escape

[Chorus]
I'm crawling my way back to you, my love
From the depths of this bottomless pit
Enveloped by every obstacle
Seeking level ground that does not exist

Night shades have burned down before my very eyes
The carnival has passed and left
With every empty night in my heart and soul
I have contended with every last breath

[Verse 3]
Restless hand grenade
With a penchant for being used
Complicated, albeit atrophied
Bearing salt for endless wounds

[Chorus]
I'm crawling my way back to you, my love
From the depths of this bottomless pit
Enveloped by every obstacle
Seeking level ground that does not exist

Night shades have burned down before my very eyes
The carnival has passed and left
With every empty night in my heart and soul
I have vontended with every last breath

[Verse 1]
When you want what you need, but don't know about it
What you feel, what you see, what you dream about

[Refrain]
Let's start when you know what to do about it
When you can't seem to do anything at all
Just go, go, go, go

When you tell it, why d'you steal what you fight about?
When you run, when you scream, when you take it down

Just go, go, go, go

I will like you, like you
Even when you're upside down
I will take you, break you
Turn your world around and round
I will like you, like you
Take you deep inside of me
I'll show you, show you
How to set your lightning fire free

[Chorus 2]
I will break you, hold you
Even even in the darkest light
I believe in you, dream of you
Dream until we get it right
I will like you, like you
Take you deep inside of me
I will show you, show you
How to set your lightning fire free

And we are, reflection, reflection

[Verse 1]
She is a little girl, full of emotion
With a heart of stone
Her dreams float across the ocean
She's all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And while she's back again
She wants you back again
She'll stop at nothing just to be beside you
She's at the door again
But I won't let her in
No, I won't let that girl destroy you

[Chorus]
She wants to play with fire, come and get it
She wants to play with fire, yeah
She wants to play with fire, come and get it
She wants to play with fire

[Verse 2]
She is so desperate to cause a commotion
Her mind is blown
She stabs in a twisted motion
Cuts to the bone

[Pre-Chorus]
And while she's back again
She wants you back again
She'll stop at nothing just to be beside you
She's at the door again
But I won't let her in
No, I won't let that girl destroy you

[Chorus]
She wants to play with fire, come and get it
She wants to play with fire, yeah
She wants to play with fire, come and get it
She wants to play with fire

[Bridge]
Yeah, I always know, whoah
It's haunting you
'Cause she always shows, whoah
She's wanting you
Yeah i always know, whoah
It's haunting you
'Cause she always shows, whoah
She's wanting

[Chorus/Outro]
She wants to play with fire, come and get it
She wants to play with fire, yeah
She wants to play with fire, come and get it
She wants to play with fire, yeah
She wants to play with fire, I know
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants to
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants you
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants to
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants you
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants to
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants you
She wants to play with fire, I know she wants to

[Verse 1]
You know, I know who you are
I can see underneath all the scars
But I need you now
But you don't know how
And it feels empty
When you're hiding with me, baby

[Hook]
Will you let me in?
Let love begin
You can't continue with the sabotage
So let me in
Let love begin
And shed the skin of your camouflage

[Verse 2]
So will you show who you are?
I can see (I can see, I can see, I can see)
Way beyond the mirage
'Cause I need you now
But you don't know how
And it feels empty
When you're hiding with me, baby

[Hook]
Will you let me in?
Let love begin
You can't continue with the sabotage
So let me in
Let love begin
And shed the skin of your camouflage

[Bridge]
So baby, hurry
I'm getting worried
Baby, hurry
You're running out of time

[Hook/Outro - x2]
Will you let me in?
Let love begin
You can't continue with the sabotage
So let me in
Let love begin
And shed the skin of your camouflage

[Verse 1]
Take a hit, this is it
There's no turning back
Fantasy, dressed in black
Told you so, boy you know
That you come right back
Faster than a heart attack

[Pre-Hook 1]
Got you addicted
You can't help but want more
You'll bring me anything
Just to make the next score
Get what I want
As I take over your world
Feels so good to be a bad girl

[Hook]
Bad girl
Bad girl
Bad girl
Feels so good to be a bad girl

[Verse 2]
So depraved, just a slave
'Cause you need my touch
This feels so dangerous
Don't you stop 'til you drop
Gotta keep it up
Ecstasy, can't get enough

[Pre-Hook 2]
Like an obsession
Banging hard on the door
I got you begging
To throw me on the floor
Get what I want
As I take over your world
Feels so good to be a bad girl

[Hook]
Bad girl
Bad girl
Bad girl
Feels so good to be a bad girl

[Bridge]
You know you want it, 'cause I got it
I'm a bad girl
You know you want it, 'cause I got it
I'm a bad girl
You know you want it, 'cause I got it
I'm a bad girl
You know you want it, 'cause I got it, got it
Bad girl

[Hook]
Bad girl
Bad girl
Bad girl
Feels so good to be a bad girl

[Outro]
You know you want it, 'cause I got it
I'm a bad girl
You know you want it, 'cause I got it
I'm a bad girl
You know you want it, 'cause I got it
I'm a bad girl
You know you want it, 'cause I got it, got it
Bad girl

[Verse 1]
Something's got a hold on me
It's beginning to haunt me
Baby, I gotta know
Do you even want me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you finish what you started?
Don't leave me here broken hearted
Dancing alone in the darkness
At the edge of the night

[Chorus]
Your love is like a strobe light
You turn it on, then you turn it off
It gets so bright
But I can't see baby when it stops

[Verse 2]
You tell me all these things
Why can't you just show me?
Baby, you're so unsure
Do you even know me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you finish what you started?
Don't leave me here broken hearted
Dancing alone in the darkness
At the edge of the night

[Chorus]
Your love is like a strobe light
You turn it on, then you turn it off
It gets so bright
But I can't see baby when it stops

[Bridge]
Like a strobe light
Like a strobe light
Like a strobe light
Like a strobe light

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you finish what you started?
Don't leave me here broken hearted
Dancing alone in the darkness
At the edge of the night

[Chorus]
Your love is like a strobe light
You turn it on, then you turn it off
It gets so bright
But I can't see baby when it stops
Your love is like a strobe light
You turn it on, then you turn it off
It gets so bright
But I can't see baby when it stops

[Outro]
Like a strobe light
Like a strobe light
Like a strobe light
Like a strobe light

Don't walk away, you love me
No matter what you say, you need me
Don't try to change what is meant to be

[Verse 2]
Can't run away, I love you
No matter what you say, I need you
Don't try to change a love that's true

[Pre-Hook]
Always will adore you
Always leave before you
How can you ignore my love?

[Hook]
Give yourself up to me (me, me)
Give yourself up to me (me, me)
Give yourself up to me (me, me)
Give yourself up to me (me, me, me, me, me, me)

Dreams from the days of others
Green fields walk out today, push the wheel, come what may
Gleam from the ways of suffering, suffering
Choose those who can wait, pull the years past the gate
Steal from the ways of nothing, nothing
Just leave all that can stay, light the reels, light the way
Dreams from the days of suffering, suffering
White flowers walk out today, push the fields that we've made
Dreams from the days of others, fathers
White light washes away, break the wheels, come what may

[Verse 1]
Stood on the edge of the blue black river
Buried my feet in the sand
Late summer when suns of terrible shiver
Into my spine and hands
[?] wooden wind chimes [?] each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it the mellow he cried
Carries a piece of the your mind away
Buries it deep in the sand
Buries it deep in your hands
Buries it deep in the sand

[Chorus]
Oh rama
On the crack of dawn
Darling of the sea
Breathing up the sun, spinning down and down

[Verse 2]
Follow you down in a mindless vision
Diamonds and empty hands
Start of the sea just to hear them coming
Lights from a distant land
Find my way back to the place I loved

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it the mellow he cried
Carries a piece of your mind away
Buries it deep in the sand
Buries it deep in your hands
Buries it deep in the sand

[Chorus]
Oh rama
On the crack of dawn
Darling of the sea
Breathing up the sun, spinning down and down

[Chorus]
Oh rama
On the crack of dawn
Darling of the sea
Breathing up the sun, spinning down and down

Spinning down and down
Spinning down and down
Spinning down and down
Spinning down and down

Men traveled down winding pathways
Winding through my house
Empty cans dripping their sad days
In their wake I may be lost
One by one, they fade to the distance
Their trails evaporate
Leaving the path they breathed through me
Less clean and true than appears to be
What may strike the curious eye
And then there came the one who is
Swimming through my veins
True and clean was he
That day he drew through my house
The winding winds caught just right
In his wake, the charms at my windows
Whispered temptations at night
His drops mislaid turned to ponds and then lakes
And, through a mist of
Heavy lovers, I am, by a miracle
Drawn at once to an angel
How the weight has shifted, in my eye
Then there came the one who is
Swimming through my veins
He stays with me

[Passionate MC]
It's like the whole world's trying to force me to fail
Aiming for the scorpion’s head but forgetting about it's poisonous tail
Claws pinch harder than horse kicks
And all this venom exits the pen that I draw with
Entering the lettering I mark in
With the accuracy of David’s anatomy in Michelangelo’s carving when the art blends
When I'm on they call quits, This nigga wasn’t born with an off switch!
Give a fuck what they all wish!
I write what I write, fuck the type of an audience!
Even when we're on stage they’re ignoring shit
How you go to shows to NOT be a part of it?
In the back sipping gnac where the bar permits
For you to act like it’s a diplomatic partnership
Show respect you annoying bitch
Or get turned to accordions with the hands you wasn't applauding with!
Man, I'm sick of this music
Yeah, the internet's a tool, but these fools just abuse it!
Shit's confusing, so much distribution but not enough listeners consuming
Everybody’ pitching a movement but how long til there’s not enough room for us to move in?
Oh, the game’s rough?
Half of you would be nice if you were as good as the excuses you made up
I got nothing you could take from
In a place where you could lose your life for trying to scrape crumbs
Where your family starves if you scrape none, and there’s no opportunity so you gotta make one!
I'm the dog underneath the dog under the underdog
Using claws to rip the muzzle off his jaw!!!
Giving bars till his muscles are sore, (GIVE IT MORE!)
I'ma show you what these muscles are for!
With the passionate delivery in the raps I'm delivering
On the track as you're listening, like a masterful symphony
Crafted back in the century when classical assemblies
Were put together better than photographical imagery!
I'ma make you remember me
Invade your memory till I'm charged with breaking and entering
I'm behind the bars instantly
To the future so far my past makes history
And to the end I will extend
From the chest where I suffered through the death of my best friend
17 in a casket, can’t get past it. Trying to bring her back with my last wish
Thinking back to our last kiss, the first woman to ever believe in the Passionate
So ""I promise you"" Brittany
As long as I clutch the mic they never will fuck with me!
I don’t give a damn if I'm 60, damaged & sickly, with no other man even listening
To any of the jams that I spit free
I will stand as an MC. Raise your damn hands if you’re with me!
I rip mics to fight hatred
I like to write and strike like lightsabers!
Despite the price my life ignites pages
Lyrically limitless and infinitely ageless...
Written with the energy you gave it, driven through appraisement
For every single minute that I paid with
Make way for the chosen one, from Cranston
Welcome to the force within...

Verse 1:
I remember those days
Lil’ kid chilling, I would play with my toys
Pokémon villains, gotta’ tame them boys
Built friendships, but I had to let go(Lego)
Growing up quick
That’s the thing that stays yo
Same with thing with my mojo
Left with a few real that I know /
So lets go
To time where we had silly horrors
Roaming the woods like explorers
Conquer the beasts right before us
Talking bout’ pretty girls in our fortress
And man not a worry in world-blind to it all
Till’ I grow tall, I won’t bust my nerve
But that time’s here, and I got the call
Say hello to this place that’s called earth

Hook:
(Mmm!)
We'll go through all these changes, walk these places
To next chapter, flip the pages
Yeah I know this
We'll just go through all these stages
I don’t get down I feel amazing
X2

Verse 2:
I’m feeling superman, can't(kent) feel another way
Buddha stance has me wishing I could levitate
Blunts at glance, has me thinking to elaborate
I'm just trying find my place, fam
On this road, that’s not close to home
Reaching to some places that are way beyond
What about this style, will they give their nods
I’ll just do my thing try to beat the odds
Two cents for toss, sentiments in vault
Opened up for all, so you could see my flaws
I might go to mars the way I rocket
I’m the only pilot, zooming by in my spaceship
I just landed, another planet
With the colors on my palette
Picasso, my talent, so scratch where I've been
Only matters where we headin'
[Bridge]
When I was teen, I felt lost in the universe
Yet I still feel so lost in the universe
But I was losing hope, for my place in the universe
Now I see how I belong in the universe

Didn't know everything was connected yeah
Didn't know I was sleeping through my life yeah
Now I hope, we could make some good changes yeah
So let's grow, cuz that’s we came for yeah

Hook:
(Mmm!)
So many places, so many changes
Just gotta face it, we’ll go through these stages
Onto the next chapter, just flippin these pages
So many changes, but I think that we'll get through them
So many changes, yeah I know I that we'll get through them

In these low times of low tides
I say thank you though
Like Van Gogh I paint
The scene away so insane
Cut off I didn’t hear you right
Standing in the middle of the road
On this starry night talking to the moon
Like a convo' on my phone
Clear like Figi bars are LTE
/but when you and me speak its less than 3g
You like to drink but you don’t want no 3gs
I think I’m from or I’m destined
The higher planes
That’s why I elevate every single day
Not for religion that I pray
Can I just meditate?
Just on this island picture this
Bliss like a kiss
Until I’m back hold this image
Just gotta’ say alright
Flyers jacket on, taking flight

[Hook]
Damn, this some real shit
Feeling like I’m on top of these clouds
That’s some real shit
X2
Do you want this, cuz' we could be high all the time
X2

[Verse 2]
All the time, my mind it rewinds
I refind, and remind myself that I must remain grateful
Dead, I will not be
Feeling like I got the itch
To stay creating
I stay debating
Patiently weighing out all my options
She was plan A and plan b
Is flipping I'll get you anything
Glittery I rub off on your mind
Feels like there's no one I can find
Alone going bars to the wall
Going deep grab the axe and just mine
Through all these melodies
Sing songs heavenly
[Hook]
Damn, this some real shit
Feeling like I’m on top of these clouds
That’s some real shit
X2
Do you want this, cuz we could be high all the time
X2

[Bridge]
Ok, ok, ok, ok you know I got it
Ok, ok, ok, ok you know I’m rocking
Ok, ok, ok, ok you know I got it
Ok, ok, ok, ok you know I got it

Oh yeah, oh yeah, you know… oh… oh.. oh…
Will I ever find you?

[Hook]
Damn, this some real shit
Feeling like I’m on top of these clouds
That’s some real shit

Do you want this, cuz' we could be high all the time

[Verse]
Wake up, from the palms and the coconut
Get up, almond joys, that's the best I got
Six hours so caught up, staring at the clock
Hours turn to years, it’s all adding up
Go to school so that you might be a lawyer
Doesn't appeal, it’s not what I’m in search of
So if you judge me, let it be brief
No time to waste
And Family that I can't even see
Came so far just to be here, so I need to study
Telling them, I'm pretty sweet
White like a marshmallow, want s'more?
Kick up the feet and just settle and be in awe from my level
Power up like times 4
Blond hair but I’m different from the Eminems (m & m's)
I got my own flavor man
Gotta’ hold it down for my whole fam’
I'll even raise a shark, I’m the anchorman

[Hook]
Oh yeah, so we gotta’ get to it
Rather mind my own, ride alone
You just get used to it
That's the way that I'm groovin’

Oh yeah, so we gotta’ get to it
Rather mind my own, ride alone
You just get used to it
There's no secret, just lose it

[Verse 2]
Would they see me as a fool, I don't give a fuck
Let me make my own rules, make my own luck
Fated by the codes & rope-by the strings that tugs
That would make me an ordinary mule but
We're not asses, just born into faction
I don’t belong, tired of blending with the masses
Feeling so divine
Who are you, who am I?
Pondering this time so let’s decide
And fathom the infinite, we’re infinite
We used to think the sky was the limit
Sailing past the Atlantic where you’d fall into abyss
Its different, we can make it
Yo, so watch the way I'm rocking
Got the boat flopping
People off of the dock and
Caught up in the current
Sometimes you just have swim
Parallel, without the help, the lifeguard won't always be there to save you

[Hook]
Oh yeah, so we gotta’ get to it
Rather mind my own, ride alone
You just get used to it
That's the way that I'm groovin’

Oh yeah, so we gotta’ get to it
Rather mind my own, ride alone
You just get used to it
There's no secret, just lose it

"
140901,"

[Verse]
So what's it like out like out there, are you scared?
Feeling trapped, like I don't know I still fear
Holding on, bond with the game set my snares
Got this net I'm double o in account, plus an O, that's three 7's
You're in luck, picture this and relax
Palm trees, with a drink, where ya at?
Breeze blowing, rainstorms, hold your hat
Making payments, karma in balance
Call me sir, gotta’ lance
/you could dance on a lot, I guess that’s why your from came a lot
Oh already taken, No quit playing
Was I wrong, was I mistaken?
Looking in the mirror, but I don't see reflection
Hard to swallow like pill in indigestion
Accept this, for lifetimes you've been the shit
I'm blessed so I just spit a lil’ bit of direction

[Hook]
Figuring out, like 1 2 3
That I'm more, than I can be
Think that I've been here too long
Think that I've been here too long

I don't know bout’ you & me
On the other side, must be green
Think that I've been here too long
Think that I've been here too long

[Post-hook]
Tryna’ maintain this patience
Tryna’ fly planes, never landing
Tryna’ to explain, not understanding
Tryna’ take aim, never missing

[Verse 2]
Yeah its hard to stay sober, loner, roller-coaster
I've roaming in the night, got the spliff on light
All night, alright
Got school in morning I don't want to rise & shine
Suburban living, always gotta’ drive
Smoke and fly don’t drink and die
This way I’m doing fine
East coasting and I like to glide
Like surfing bird let that middle finger fly
To those who don't like
Paradise visualized
All my goals defined
In bold, gold letters
So everyday I get much better
Not of mice men, we don't chase that cheddar
I let it come to me
By letting all my talent breathe
A farm like George and Lennie’s
Everybody wants a piece
Hold on with all teeth
I'm dog off the leash &
Watch the sunset bleed
Please don't look back
You'll end up in the dirt packed
Burned quick like bong snap
Our dreams don’t rest in peace
All my G's
Always know to get that so we never sleep

[Hook]
Figuring out, like 1 2 3
That I'm more, than I can be
Think that I've been here too long
Think that I've been here too long

I don't know bout’ you & me
On the other side, must be green
Think that I've been here too long
Think that I've been here too long

[Verse]
So I'm living surrounded
Prana breathing I’m grounded
Piece by piece I'm about it
Making beats, you won't doubt it
Got it, drop it
I feel like all these fakes just prove me the hottest
Watch all them fall, I need a rake so I dispose of their bodies
Does that me cold-minded
It’s my season, working like im on a ranch for that salad
I gotta’ eat, none of that junk food/
Better retreat/ comfy living synchronicity
Looking past veil
Life revealed, they've concealed
Lucy, stung by the eel


[Hook]
Even if they don't know, I'm good
And even if they don't see, I'm good
And even if they don't care, I'm good
I'm tuning to the top, so you know that I'm good


[Verse 2]
My medicine, when I'm looking thin
Positive all within/ gotta’ show them the power that I have inside
Do you like?
Ride my bike
Dos ciclos which I abide/
Soul and ego side by side
Follow my gut that is my guide
Tune with solfeggio this body
This vehicle like Ferrari bro
So I heal with green vegetables
Just a Scorpio with a blue aura
Old soul, taking control
Simulate my own game, stimulate my own lane
AK new aim if days mundane

[Hook]
Even if they don't know, I'm good
And even if they don't see, I'm good
And even if they don't care, I'm good
I'm tuning to the top, so you know that I'm good

So let’s go explore the universe
Don't need to concern
I just want to see what else there is
So let’s go, so let’s go

And my dreams are really more than words
This I can confirm
I just want to see what else there is
So let’s go, so let’s go


[Verse]
Pick up the pen so I’m creating
Fusing the moods with grooves onto the paper
Aiming to surpass the moon, it’s my habit I can’t evade it
So I embrace it
Never looking down at the pavement
Sometimes the trail that seems the safest
Isn't the lane you should be chasing
Even if it’s greatly populated
Feel like I could do this
Because I’m uber super what’s the word
Flip the bird to these loosers
Going deep like scuba, coral in the ocean
Reefer blowing
Tidal waves I’m growing
Flowing like its osmosis
River rolling so it's any challenges eroded
Split this mental cell in half like mitosis
I've exploded
Get the gold its Nuclear Olympics here
Make sure to stick the final trick
It's the bomb shit
Watch the whole ground shift
My amplitude rising
Richter scale defines it
Tune in like the radio, I'll find it

[Bridge]
Yeah I keep bumpin’(x1) knowing that I'm something(x2)

Tuning to paradise, with my pair of mellow eyes, all I see is love
A miracle I’m alive, so I stay right on my grind
/even push brought to shove

So let’s go explore the universe
Don't need to concern

So let’s go, so let’s go

And my dreams are really more than words
This I can confirm

So let’s go, so let’s go

[Verse 2]
Restless I’ve been
Driving day to day
24 hours, if you’re going a dozen double miles per hour
Please get out the way
Like get outa’
Mario kart, use my power
Swerving past like hello
I’m going somewhere like a paradise
For a moment with my pair of mellow eyes
Just to be stellar fly
And soar amongst stars
Where I just feel better than
Most of them
In this universe where I’m embedded in
Observe through the hologram
Might not understand
But ill lend a hand tellen’ em’
Mirror effect
What we feel we reflect
The universe is in connect
So be your own architect
Lowercase m's shape so delicious
/how I manifest these roman bridges
No McDonalds I got decisions
Structures topple I avoid these symptoms
In this living I will not be the victim
Not on the bench
I'm in the game and I’m winning

[Break]
Miracle I’m alive x3 so I stay right on my grind
On, on my grind

[Hook]
So let’s go explore the universe
Don't need to concern

And my dreams are really more than words
This I can confirm
I just want to see what else there is
So let’s go, so let’s go

[Verse]
Projections  my senses, I see this world through my lenses
Gloomy vision spreading through all this shit they've been telling
Like on TV screen when you see a killing spree
News hang you down, but glee, that's the only message that I'm spreading
Avatar, these words I've been Fire bending, like fuego burn this building down
I got stories like hotels
Open book, read me for show & tell
I'm free falling, I'm free falling
Plenty petty persons pickpocket robbing my time for that non-important
Cuz' all that small talk really got me snoring
But BIG talk the one with Pac
This deep conversation swallow ya like fish caught
This separation never existed
I am you, and you are me
Oh ya haven't heard?
Might be bodhisattava
Stomach ease, when there's peace in the world
/for now I'm shitting on em, diarrhea
Spit triple shots like semi
Drink a little, toxic alcohol like sawed-off
Don’t need salt, & already acidic so might shine like limelight
Jealous sour citrus faces combine
Lyrical hits, not shallow pits
They stink, don't dig far with their shovels
Knock on Hollow domes, no one home
Watch it crumble cuz' the wolf came down to tango
Dicaprio on Wall Street, avalanches my goals
Lava frantic run away you might just  panic
Don’t be standing, We out here like the disco ball
Shining like the flames from the missile exhaust
Like addict to addy' manic I’m flash, like dash
Add to sentences you thought were finished
Only splashed the surface, top of the iceberg
Titanic what a shame, sliced, the smallest gash
Had the most impact/ how we play
Paradise can't be gambled over a pair of dice
Every thought & phrase gets analyzed
Frequency increase in size, it's not hard, but aroused is my state of mind

[Outro]
We project, how we see the world
So I tune my world
Elevate my world

140905,"

[Verse 1]
Hold on there and listen now
Take a seat and let your heart, sink with the beat
Prestigious but I’m not ivy, watch what you touch
I still dragon breathe, that fire speaks
You swing sword at me, don’t have the power
Got scales for shield, I fling it back into your spleen
F sharp glad fully, another casualty (fuck!)
The Glass is half-full take a sip from my cup
I'm the doctor production nip and tuck
Sound is so deluxe
Should wear a tux of a million bucks
Think im worth enough
I deserve the cut
Swerve to soccer practice for my lil’ other
Surveillance to prove stunter
Showing  how to score goals like Ronaldo
8 years old, wants to be like older brother

[Hook]
And you know I'll still be rockin'
Cuz’ you know that I just got it/
So real, so real (yup, yup)
And you know I'll still be rockin'
Cuz’ you know that I just got it/
So real, so real (yup, yup)

[Verse 2]
Take a photo
It's about the bigger picture
It's not about me
I'm a fountain of light photons
In a vast ocean
With my proportions
Child of the sun
Bring the tree to the palm
Blend with mood like chameleon
From this island that I’m on
It’s like domino peace I spread
Can’t we get along?
Sound ricochets from the lead
Straight to the head
Quiet rather leave my mark instead
Beats loud Stampede Bound instrumentals dead
Ya’ can't win this bet
Leave em’ trampled
My friend, No guitar samples, living ample
Talk money then gamble
The house always wins
I'm 3 in one
You already lost
With that aura dim
My karma lends, so I order gifts

[Hook]
And you know I'll still be rockin'
Cuz’ you know that I just got it/
So real, so real (yup, yup)
And you know I'll still be rockin'
Cuz’ you know that I just got it/
So real, so real (yup, yup)

[Bridge]
So are they still talking
About the places that they've never walked in
I elevate, I do it often
I stay real, let that do the talking
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeyeeah x4
Don’t you want to be this real? Don’t you want? X2

So real x 3

[Verse]
In the moment
I'm at peace in the woods
Beauty potent
Energy  feel this buzz
Light years blunt
May I say so to to myself
Shift gears thrust
NY pace after saying my farewells
I've been ready down to play
Mantras mumbling my spells
Gauntlets for all my people
And toasts for making time like medieval
Now in the sequel
Returned still looks so evil
Get that bread like some seagulls
Philly flying like the eagles
Peter panoramic 360 my vision
Heater automatic bulls eye my precision
Matador they make you run into the prison
Mad like thor I bring it down so they will listen
Sucked into the television
Even Pinocchio knows better
Mcconaughey in interstellar
Save the day, I'm much more clever
But Hombre, whats on my entre
Devour my endeavors
Cuz' tengo mucho hambre
It's chess not checkers
And take a look around man
Enjoying any weather

[Chorus]
Take a moment, smell the roses
This isn't how it was supposed to be
I'm stopping to see the eternity
Everything stops when you learn to breathe

Take a moment, don't you notice
Everything is better than it seems
There's more to this thing called reality
Everything stops when you learn to breathe

[Verse 2]
Or does it not stop
Everything's In motion, my crowd posted
Like a note, reminding you the game is loaded
No need to buffer
I'm just a puffer at the bottom of the ocean
Undiscovered yet so in the open
Holy token, I'm golden
If you're smoking, keep on molding
Play these riffs, and floating on my rafts
Tamed the tiger and a friend despite our differences
Time collapsed the days are limitless
Sailing adrift
Become the alchemist
A Paddle lock secure my thoughts
And rap em' down the streets
When I'm just popping these flips
Got my shoes ripped
I was tryna' do it big
But I just knew that's not it
Still I fly high, besides
You gotta feel like God
So when you just might
Find your love and play your part
Even to start and hit my first down
Rail I slammed the ground hard
Fails I just applaud
Bails made me see wrong

[Hook]
Take a moment, smell the roses
This isn't how it was supposed to be
I'm stopping to see the eternity
Everything stops when you learn to breathe

Take a moment, don't you notice
Everything is better than it seems
There's more to this thing called reality
Everything stops when you learn to breathe

[Bridge]
How ya feeling
Yeah Im feeling fine
When I'm learning how to fly
Got the world in my eyes
And what is the time
That’s a wrist watch
What is the time
That’s a wrist watch
When I enter my mind
It goes bye bye
And the whole world seems to crumble
When I enter my mind
It goes bye bye
And the whole word seems to crumble

"
140907,"

[Verse]

Some days I feel like I'm something
Other days, I feel like I'm not even nothing
Color ways to show that I'm bumpin'
Stuck in the rain, maybe another day
Haze in my face, when I be down
They wanna race, prove em clown
No mask,  feelings on the ground
Too many tasks, no daps and pounds
/I won't be around
I know that I gotta focus
On my grind, hold it
Legs folded, can't even sit in lotus position
Younger mind left plateaued/
Would've gone on bitchin'
Pressure holds, fresher vibes
Never fail on my my mission
Story told, you'll be fine, wait just a minute


[Hook]
(Ok ok ok ok)
I gotta' stop worrying so much
In the end it will be fine
(Ok ok ok ok)
I gotta' stop worrying so much
Doubts aside, I just can't get enough

Running out of time
Have it on my mind
I got lots of worries
(Ok ok ok ok)
Spending all this time
Worries make me climb
I guess that’s just the purpose
(Ok ok ok ok)


[Verse 2]
Stars align, when I/
Kaleidoscope, all of my strengths with all of my woes
I'll be fine when I'm
Sledding down all the slopes, highs and the lows
Propelling me doing the most, don't watch TV more
Don't play video games, working to solve the pain
When they're lost in their ways
Failing to see the real game
Make my screenplay,  love all these characters
Alexander the great, have that game plan
Conquer on calendar
Slaves money famished
Hypnotized, no one panics
Lost advantage, third damaged
They want to vanquish
Power money living lavish
While most of us still trying to manage

[Hook]
(Ok ok ok ok)
I gotta' stop worrying so much
In the end it will be fine
(Ok ok ok ok)
I gotta' stop worrying so much
Doubts aside, I just can't get enough

Running out of time
Have it on my mind
I got lots of worries
(Ok ok ok ok)
Spending all this time
Worries make me climb
I guess that’s just the purpose

Woke last night in the middle of a combat zone
Helicopters hovering over my home
My baby boy is sleeping in the other room
And ooh my soul

Born into the bullshit baby, you and me
But it don't have to be our legacy
There must be someplace better we can raise a family
Oh ooh my soul

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Baby I'm gone
Baby I'm gone
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Baby I'm gone gone
Baby I'm gone

And the man is dropping hooks into the crowd
He aims to sell you heaven in a can
And the ghost who named Los Angeles is laughing out loud
What came from desert will soon return to sand
Baby I'm gone
Baby I'm gone

A world gets weary and times get tough
The rich get richer and the rest get fffffffffffff
You know I ain't no hippie but I'm sure I've had enough
Oh ooh ooh my soul

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Baby I'm gone gone
Baby I'm gone
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Baby I'm gone gone gone
Baby I'm gone gone gone
Baby I'm gone daddy gone
I'm a gone gone gone
Oh gone daddy gone I'm gone

Carrie -- A shy girl who doesn’t make friends easily…
I wanna be myself and I want everyone to see me
I wanna be myself and Mama you can’t stop me
I wanna be myself and I want everyone to see me
I wanna be myself and Mama you can’t stop me
(Why didn’t ya tell me, Mama? They threw things at me, Mama.)
Carrie got her period in the shower
Carrie got her period and everyone laughed at her
Carrie got her period in the shower
Carrie got her period and everyone laughed at her
You’re a woman now, Carrie
Tommy ain’t in love with me
That’s something that is plain to see
Tommy ain’t in love with me
That’s something that is plain to see
We’re all very sorry, Cassie
Don’t you know that killing’s a sin?
My very own mother is doing me in
Don’t you know that killing’s a sin?
My very own mother is doing me in
Eve was weak
Eve was weak
Carrie went home and drew a bath
Carrie went home and Mama stabbed her in the back
Carrie went home and drew a bath
Carrie went home and Mama stabbed her in the back
Eve was weak. She loosened The Raven upon the world and The Raven was called Sin
Say it, Carrie. SAY IT!!!

[Verse 1]
I'm a creep and a liar
You don't mind at all
You're a freak, a vampire
The night can take its toll

[Pre-Chorus]
But I love you, honey

[Chorus]
Stay away from me
Tenderness is not for me
I could watch you die and not feel a thing

[Verse 2]
I masturbate, I'm a crier
I do it just because
I look great in denial
Every liar does

[Pre-Chorus]
But I love you, honey

[Chorus]
Stay away from me
Watch a canole suffocate
Say what you feel is like empathy

But I love you, honey

Watch a canole suffocate

You've been hanging out
With somebody round town
I will find out
Some people that I know
Are gonna track him down
And run him out

[Verse 2]
Between you and me
I see you in my dreams
You seem so sweet
Tomorrow's just the same
You smile and ask my name
Each time we meet

[Chorus]
That time after the show
I let you bum a smoke
You put it to your lips
Then I let my heart explode
I think we'd get along
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've thought about it for so long

[Verse 3]
I been hanging out with
A treasure I found
Your red lipstick
You dropped it in my car
The night I drove you home
You were so sick

[Verse 4]
I bought a little dress
That suits your attitude
Someday it's yours
It keeps me company
My little fantasy
Behind closed doors

[Chorus]
That time after the show
I let you bum a smoke
You put it to your lips
Then I let my heart explode
I think we'd get along
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've thought about it for so long

[Chorus]
That time after the show
I let you bum a smoke
You put it to your lips
Then I let my heart explode

Don't tell me that I'm wrong

I've thought about it for so long

Heart, break is such a sacred word

I think I heard it before, about some other girl
But I've never felt it before, the concept is such a bore
I tried so hard to ignore, I don't understand what it's for

[Chorus]

If I could just embrace tonight, is not your night
Some other time might be alright
Another world, another heart could make a difference from the start

Heart, beats locked up in a cage

Commemorating the day, I could still look at your face
Not want to asphyxiate, my blood starts to circulate
It's harder to contemplate, drowning in the heartbreak

[Chorus]

If I could just embrace tonight, is not your night
Some other time might be alright
Another world, another heart could make a difference from the start
Tonight is not your night, some other time I'd be alright
Another world, another heart could make a difference from the start

I believe in girls who believe
In rock and roll
I believe in girls who believe
In rock and roll

Won't you tell me I'm not the only one
Who thinks it should be this way
I believe that there will come a time
When we can all just

[Chorus]
Rock and roll
Rock roll roll
Baby lose your brain
And rock and roll

[Verse 2]
You would think that sex
Would be enough to fill the world
You would think that every girl and boy
Could find a boy or girl

Won't you tell me I'm not the only one
Who thinks it should be this way
I believe that there will come a time
When we can all just

[Chorus]
Rock and roll
Rock roll roll
Baby lose your brain
And rock and roll

You've been told that drugs are gonna stain
Your plain white soul
With your shoes turned up doing that dance
You look like Popeye's Olive Oyl

I could be Henry T. Thoreau
I could be Edgar Allan Poe
I believe that there will come a time
When we can all just

Nothing in my nature tells me not to do bad things
I know that I really should be good tonight
There's a kind of satisfaction that destruction brings
Consequences never could convince me that I should do right

[Chorus]
I'll come crashing
I'll come crashing
I'll come crashing down in the ash of a fire that
I built

[Verse 2]
Mama always told me I should have sense of pride,
Daddy always told me how to be a straight up guy.
always tell the truth and never have a thing to hide,
but I'm gonna shoot the moon and watch it fall from the sky

[Chorus]
I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing down in the ash of a fire that
I built
nothing matches the passion and thrill of desired overkills

I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing down in the ash of a fire that
I built
nothing matches the passion and thrill of desired overkills

I wanna stare at you like a photograph
I wanna make you cum if you can make me laugh
Wanna spin you upside down like a rodeo between the sheets
I wanna stare at you with my eyes all wide
I wanna make you cry, I wanna make you crack
My name up to the sky, like bolts of lightning every time we meet

[Verse One]
You're naked and the house is cold
The mirror says you're getting old
I wanna see you with your sagging tits
I wanna see you with your jeans all split
I wanna kiss you when your teeth all rot
And all your memories are things we thought
I wanna see you with your sagging tits
I wanna see you with your jeans all split

I wanna stare at you like a photograph
I wanna make you cum if you can make me laugh
Wanna spin you upside down like a rodeo between the sheets
I wanna stare at you with my eyes all wide
I wanna make you cry, I wanna make you cry
My name up to the sky, like bolts of lightning every time we meet

You're naked and the house is cold
The mirror says you're getting old
I wanna see you with your sagging tits
I wanna see you with your jeans all split

I got a wallet
Looking slim on a limb I went out last night
Spent all my money
On some bait for a date but she didn't bite

[Chorus]
I can sleep when I am dead
All my friends say I look tired
I can barely hold my head up
I really think I'm dying
I'm dying

[Verse 2]
I saw your daughter
Lose control on a pole at the titty bar
I could've bought her
But the junk in her trunk didn't make me hard

[Chorus]
I can sleep when I am dead
All my friends say I look tired
I can barely hold my head up
I really think I'm dying
I'm dying

I can barely hold my head up
I really think I'm dying

How, how, how, how...
How do I loosen myself from your hold?
Is it just a case of walking away?
It showers over me and I sway
I run to find shelter from the mood
Will you help me not let it seep through?

I, I, I, I....
I go into my shell
Low for days
Is it my low or hers?
Is it my low or yours?
I think it's yours
I think it's yours

"
142131,"

How you feel about it, I don't know
I probably never will
All I know, is that I'm not the same

One week, is all it took
To change my whole outlook
And I can't stay down there
No I can't go back
No I can't dwell in that
There are other places to go

I was just moving with it
Just breathing in it
Didn't think about it all too much
Or where I was going to

I feel your intent
I'm not sure, of the meaning of it yet
But nothing, nothing feels bad
And I feel safer than I ever have before

"
142132,"

Sometimes I just want to collapse into you, you
But I don't know if you want me to
Or, if I should?
Shouldn't I be okay out here on my own?
Living in my little home?
No needs from others, doing it all by myself

Before I would've escaped into arms, too quickly
But touch is still necessary
So hold me now, tell me it's okay
And I'll tell you the same

Sometimes I...I just want to collapse into you
So as to ground me
Like hugging a tree
You're part of the earth that helps balance me

"
142133,"

I'm looking at you in a photo, you're in your baby pool
That was such a hot day
You were so happy
I was so tired and lonely

You smiled right at me
I tried to smile back but
You saw I was faking it
I felt so bad for that

There were some people
Around us at the time
Who weren't for us though
They claimed to be
You see on my face it was effecting me

There was a lot of warmth
In that time though
But look how heavy the clouds were
How saturated our sky was
We came through it sweetheart

No way out

Well you’re a spy
You robbed me dry
I let you into my own home [?]
And I don’t know why
You got a look
Are you the gnome
But I know you’re up to something
Baby, hon it show
And it’s starting to show

[Chorus]
Oh I still love you darling
But you’re so dumb
Looking like a little baby
Should be sucking your thumb

[Verse 2]
So have a drink
And have some more
If it makes you better
Honey how’s the score
When you’re out of the door

[Chorus]
Well I still love you darling
But you’re so dumb
Looking like a little baby
Should be sucking your thumb
I still love you darling
But you’re so dumb
Looking like a little baby
Should be sucking your thumb
Should be sucking your thumb
Well I still love you darling

Summer stole the perfume from my eye
I can't say that it took me by surprise
So tell me in some broken words goodbye
Cause summer stole the perfume from my eye

[Chorus]
Please don't concern me
Stop draggin' me around
Please don't concern me
I'm on the side

So tell me in some broekn words goodybye

I don’t know what I’m thinking
I don’t know if I’ll tell
I don’t know what will happen

[Verse 1]
You talk talking, got your head up high
Hoping someone will hear
You been dozing in the goddamn chair
So loud in my ear
One eye on the audience
And now I don’t want to kneel

[Chorus]
It’s alright yeah it’s okay
You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way
It’s alright yeah it’s okay
You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way

[Verse 2]
I saw a face in a mount of dirt
As smile was very [?]
Looking smug you let me know
They’re not that bad for a Jinn
We’re not sure if you realise
That I just don’t give a shit

[Chorus]
Yeah it’s alright yeah it’s okay
You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way
It’s alright yeah it’s okay
You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way
Yeah It’s alright yeah it’s okay
You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way

You gotta go now
Yeah pick up feet
I got nothing to say
Yeah get what you need
Yeah get going on your way

You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way
It’s alright yeah it’s okay
You got a nosebleed weekend headed your way

Sometimes I light a cigarette to throw away my care
But when I'm finished lighting it, the ash leaves me impaired
I've been so bad for so long, and it's showing on my mind
The chaos is in control and I'm having a good time

I'm so reckless, it makes me cry
And then I sit down and ask myself why
Why am I caught up in doing it right
When doing it wrong makes me feel so alive

[Chorus]
Alive. Alive. Alive. Ooh, oo-ooh
Doing it right, d-d-doing it right
Doing it right, d-d-doing it right
Alive. Alive

When I'm on my own, I always seem to drift
Into a paradise, driving in stick shift
I've been so bad for so long, and it's showing on my mind
The chaos is in control and I'm having a good time

I'm so reckless, it makes me cry
And then I sit down and ask myself why
Why am I caught up in doing it right
When doing it wrong makes me feel so alive

[Chorus]

I'm so tired of feeling unsure
Of all the obstacles, they make me impure
And when I'm over feeling so down all the time
I hope I get out alive

[Chorus]

Doing it right, d-d-doing it right
Doing it right, d-d-doing it right
Doing it right, d-d-doing it right
Doing it right, d-d-doing it right. x2

So spaced out by now i fear
I can see your house from here
You shape yourself into
A key and push it trough
The ad campaigns and posters that won't find you
I'm the see-through coffee in your coffee cup
Don't mind if i do
Don't mind if i don't wait up
Wait up
And if i had a zoo
I'd keep a box for you
You only grow up once and now it's too late
Thought you'd miss me, thought you knew me
Heather lewis, thought you'd miss me
Thought you'd write me, because you liked me
I thought you'd visit
Guess you're busy
I am selling my stocks in you
I don't trust that you keep it secret
We are billing it as the cure
Though it only will make you weaker
Than a paper float you made for a rainy day parade
So spaced out i see your house from up here
Thought you'd miss me, thought you knew me
Heather lewis, thought you knew me
Thought you'd write me, because you liked me
I thought you knew me

"
142404,"

And how long would it take me to walk across for you?
She somehow escaped the cure for being so-so in the show
Rumour has it you're in town
Electrical wires
Streched and split
Some of it tangled
In the presence of falling trees lying there
Dangerously alive
I said i wouldn't start at the end
With two crooked fingers down the road
Snapped in half
How much more do we need to take in?
How much do we need to bear?
Lunch breaks and yoga classes can't save us all
He spoke to the quiet man
On every corner, on every stand
Someone here is gonna find out how
If you have been a mistake
If you have been a success
Go back to where you came from
We don't want you here any more
Don't go, the seeking is left
Don't follow
Don't know where you will end up
I'll end up here
I am always walking when the lights are green
It's a better feeling than going in between
Don't go
No one knows where you'll end up
Lot's of people in a small room
You might die from the lack of oxygen

"
142405,"

Your ways around me
The things you never told me about your weekends
The list that you made (for weddings) that you shouldn't ever read

Like your three most favourite colours are red and black and blue
Now you're saying this delaying can only do us good
But good is not enough

Have you ever kissed a stranger? no, and never
Drank hard liquor? yes, please
Lost your glasses or your contacts?
Broken someone's heart?
Been arrested?
Turned someone down?

Do you believe in yourself?
In miracles or santa claus?
In kissing on the first date?
Do you ever think about the piercing that you got last year?
Your best friend's name is colly yap

Just this last year
You took up smoking
You got a test back
You went to pangkor
And you found out who you're friends are

My ways around you
I'm wide awake and where you are it's morning

Your zodiac sign
The secondary school you never liked

And this last year you made a new friend
And you laughed until you cried when he asked you:
If you could have, would you travel back in time?
And how far would you go?

Alert the bosses
I'll define if we took photos of the helicopter pads
I'm just having a goddamn life

There were too many chores
Too many chores

"
142406,"

There's been an outbreak of the plague this year they say
It's in our head, it's in our heart
So take good care and close your eyes
And our door handles stopped moving years ago
And our time traps don't move anymore
She went into the game
Trying to find the blame together
She went into the game
Were practically the same forever
Full of shame and hope
A tanker that explode
They sank her

"
142407,"

The red light shines for someone else
Someone new
Rocket scientists have someone else
Someone new
The last time that I waited here
I was left cold and afraid
So if you wake I'll wait right here
And I'll rain on your parade

You're someone else
You're someone new
The traffic lights and film makers are out of sight
Let's shut it down
No one sees any pictures in this town
I'll make you proud
By capturing rocket scientists and bringing them down

You wanted it, you wanted it
But no one has a rocket
You wanted it
But no one wants to shoot you into space
And now you're stuck with a broken ten-speed bike
You wanted it, you wanted it
But now we're out of luck and out of fuel
She said to the king: you've grown a beard like Fidel
Referring to the former Cuban leader
To which the king replied: I'm changing my look
She said to the king: you wear shoes like Obama
Referring to the former us president
To which the king replied: I was always a fan

If this is all you have to offer now
With a tin can and a wall of gasoline
I'm gonna burn out all of your office space
And the red light is the last you'll ever see
A curtain call and house arrest
The long hour in between
You're the whitest boy alive
And the red light is the last you'll ever see

"
142408,"

I'm watching you sinking by my side
In truth, you are far more
Than a mere detective of puzzles
But I never saw anything in you
No, I never saw anything in you
Good news: you are engaged
But the cakes are burnt

"
142409,"

I caught you waving
At the ones parading
The window dressers
The clad in iron
And it's all good riddance
It's all good riddance
And I'm waiting
Waiting on you to put it out
For it's flaming like a big word out place flaming
So ignite the 151 and let it burn
And I caught your outline
As I caught you leaving
And you said it's always
Someone who's stealing
And it's all good riddance
It's all good riddance
And I caught you waving
At the ones parading
The window dressers
The clad in iron
And it's got to be you
And I caught your outline
As I caught you leaving
And you said it's always
Someone who's stealing
And it's got to be you
Now it's burning
Like a big word
Out of context
Out of purpose
And it's got to be you
You turned your back on me
Never got to get
To burn down your office
We'd fill it up on art
And puzzles that we'd put down
With funny fingers
Placing them one by one
I won't do that, will never follow
I can remember
You were still my queen
But the books say we never went down
The truth: I hope you are more than a screen
Of puzzles that we put down
With funny fingers
Placing them one by one

Where do we go, from where do we leave?
Is there a destination or are we wandering free?
Or are we really even free and what does freedom really mean?

What reason do we have to not lose steam?
We could throw in the towel then pick it up to wipe our brow
Running laps around an endless track snaking through the sand and never turning back
What reason do we have to step up
And do our part?

So it benefits us, so we do not lose heart?
And by what holy ordination do we carry the flickering flame?
Did we light it ourselves for some selfish gain?
Was it snuffed out by my agonizing pain?

Do we even care at all, as long as we remain?

I can't give you all the answers
But I can tell you what I know
No sane man would build a dam
Just to watch it overflow

We didn't come this far
To watch it fall apart
So as we press on
We do not lose heart

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say
It is well, it is well, with my soul

When it rains, I save my pennies
When it pours, I toast to staying dry
Ooh, I don't wanna
Ooh, I don't wanna go back

Don't, don't, don't mess around
Because I've got eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town

It's a joke, to all my friends it's a joke
But the joke is on me
Ooh, it makes me nervous
Ooh, it makes me wanna crawl back
So I run to the water, that siren's bell it tolls for me
Ooh, it makes me nervous
Ooh, it makes me nervous
Ooh, it makes me, ooh it makes me wanna dive in

Don't, don't, don't mess around
Because I've got eyes all over town
Eyes all over town

I just wanna forget
I just wanna forget

I don't need your pretty eyes
Or the words you use to hypnotize
I don't trust my friends, they're always lying to me
So why do I keep their fucking company
Who cares (Who cares)
Don't need nobody but me

I'm not superstitious
Yeah, I won't be begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Woah-oh-oh

I don't feel like crying
Yeah, I'm too tired, but I'll keep trying
I don't want to sleep, because I don't want to dream
I'm just a fish in a bowl made up to look like the sea
No more smelling flowers while I'm in the weeds

I'm not superstitious
Yeah, I won't be begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Woah-oh-oh
I don't feel like crying

I'm not superstitious
And I won't be begging for forgiveness

Well, I'm burning up I must admit
Well, it's so, so serious
Write me a note for the pharmacy
Prescribe me some pills to mend my heart
Or to stop it completely

I don't want to live without you
I don't want to breathe without your love, your love, your love
Oh, your love, your love, your love

I've had the chills, I've had the spells
But I'm 27 now so what the hell
I can't be this pathetic forever
Turn off the lights and unplug my phone
To pretend I'm out, when I'm still home
Burning up with the fever

I don't want to live without you
I don't want to breathe without your love, your love, your love
Oh, your love, your love, your love

Other guys, I don't care
They don't know the things we shared
Things you write I won't read
Please love me or just leave

[Verse 1]
Take it by your silence
That I'm free to walk out the door
By the look in your eyes I can tell
You don't think I'll be back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to think of the world
Where you could stay and these safe hands could go
Take your heart above the water
Wherever I choose to go

[Chorus]
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

[Verse 2]
Even when you don't see me
And even when you don't hear
I'll be flying low below the sun
And you'll feel it all out here

[Chorus]
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

[Bridge]
Standing here in silence
The world in front of me
Holding you in my hand
And seeing as you'd see

[Chorus]
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

[Outro]
No freedom without love

No primeiro dia de aulas, toda a turma falava das férias
Eu tinha vergonha das minhas em relação às dos meus colegas
Eles contavam histórias de aviões, de piscinas
Eu passava o verão no quintal onde me sentia nas minhas quintas
Entre ninjas no telhado, nas árvores, na bicla
O mundo todo cabia naquela rua sem saída
Os joelhos esfolados, gravilha na sapatilha
O Tsubasa e o Porto jogavam na mesma equipa

Eu queria ser redes, mas nem a mim me defendia
E o que não tinha nas canetas punha nas canetilhas
Fazia as minhas próprias revistas
E não havendo o que ler, então eu escrevia

""Mas o Stray não sabe nadar, yo""
Era isso, era isso que o rádio me dizia
E realmente nessa altura eu não sabia
Mas tinha o (???) era o puto do bairro lá da vila
Não ia à praia, mas ia à terra
E a outro planetas onde o escaravelho impera
Não ia ao céu, mas ia à erva
E via mesmo os pirilampos acender entre a giesta

Toda a gente com quem trabalho me fala das férias
Eu tenho vergonha das minhas em relação às dos meus colegas
Eles contam-me histórias de aviões, de piscinas
Eu passo o verão escondido, metido na minha vida
Entre ninjas ou sozinho, em casa sem companhia
O mundo todo cabe nesta cabeça sem saída
Com os joelhos esfolados e os cotovelos em agonia
Porque meti na pinha que ia treinar muay-thai aos trinta

Eu naõ queria lutar, mas a raiva assim me obriga
E só já levanto a caneta, pousei as canetilhas
E faço as minhas próprias rimas
Vai havendo quem ouça, então eu escrevinho

""Mas o Stray não sabe rapar, yo""
Era isso, era isso que os dreads me diziam
E realmente nessa altura eu não via
Não podia ser hip-hop, só um puto estranho lá na esquina
Ia aos concertos, mas não com a gera
Era de outro  planeta, um forasteiro de outra esfera
E até hoje, fiquei à espera
E vi todos os pirilampos que se acenderam nesta merda

And he was never invincible (On a shiitake grown island)
And he was never predictable (And he be rocking that boat)
And he was never invincible
And he was never predictable

And he was never invincible
And he was never predictable

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

The water's contaminated with a peculiar illusion
Intoxicated with an electric infusion, intoxicate it
Let's have a chat to the music
We're syncopated cause I remember where to go
Getting in the zone
Move your body, and a hip a hip bone
And it was like yo
'Cause I've been living in a buttoned down world
Bottletop girl
Butterscotch flavour, covered in grazes
Come out with excuses that I bruise in the making
Carry on, crazy
Tripping on papers, bet I got bubblegum stuck to my trainers
Admit it, rarity for the flow, I hit a domino
I came a couple, couple times, decapitate my toe
It's now stuck in this crazed way

And he was never invincible (On a shiitake grown island)
And he was never predictable (And he be rocking that boat)

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

And he was never invincible (On a shiitake grown island)
And he was never predictable (And he be rocking that boat)

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

And he was never invincible
And he was never predictable

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

Stay, create a place and backdrop it

Sink, and the influence

And as you turn tears rolling down the pavement

Stay, I need your help to unblock it

Let's Eat Grandma, in full colour
I was so inspired by the grass, and the street, and the barbed wire
And the stars in the night, and the cat's eyes

We live our lives in the textbook, and letter by letter
I feel like standing on the desk, and screaming ""I don't care""
Oh, and I was such a quiet child, oh I, was I?

I bet the starfish wonder
Why we're so obsessed
Why we feel so stressed (boring)
I wish you all the best
You're making me upset (enduring things)

We're heading straight to the east coast
It's just gone bitter
The ocean doesn't care, the waves will curl our hair
In summertime, when days collide
Say, ""Why didn't we? Why didn't we?""
Go

Why why why?

[Intro: Pulso]
Ainda não sei se sabes
Aqui na nave a vista linda rumou a Marte (?)
Temos tudo o que é preciso
O tempo é lento se quiseres comprimidos
Não te atraias ao tacto
Gravidade não se aplica ao caso
Esquece o jogo impraticável
Xadrez em guardanapos
Fim expectável

[Verso 1: Pulso]
Sem regresso
O destino é o deserto que me há-de (?)
Estou no Expresso do Oriente num planeta incerto
Sem nada por perto
Se o plano der certo
É certo que vou mandar um postal a anunciar o sucesso
Quando chegar ao destino
Vou ajudar-te a acenar o cachimbo
A ensinar o regresso
A minha casa é tão grande
Que contém um universo lá dentro
E o vizinho do lado tem um igualzinho
Acabamentos a preto
Eu não me lembro se sabes
Estou de partida
Não sei onde estacionei a nave

[Refrão 3x]
No meu caso não preciso
De fazer de conta que sinto que és bem-vindo
Eu não partilho este tinto nem que tingido
Eu desatino por capricho quando é propício

[Verso 2: J-K]
Tenho o coração armadilhado com espinhos feitos de algodão
Mãos com rosas são manobras de diversão
Eu sempre soube aquilo que queria
Porque eles não entendem os versos e elas adoram a poesia
Trago o sabor da vitória e as marcas do combate
Arranhões nas costas, o pior fato no chão do quarto
Cálice cheio, no meio de cápsulas, a focar uma pluma
Três riscas, tabuleiro de prata, a afagar um puma
Peça rara, forjei uma soqueira com a minha cara
Uso o sangue para desenhar ouros e copas nas cartas
Sem mapa, eu estou tão longe
Sem data, só sei que hoje é hoje
E hoje há uma razão para brindar
Já faltou mais para acabar, já faltou mais para apagar
Já faltou mais para faltar o ar e eu só me vejo a brilhar
Eu juro, miúda, 'tou numa de me afundar

[Refrão 2x]
No meu caso não preciso
De fazer de conta que sinto que és bem-vindo
Eu não partilho este tinto nem que tingido
Eu desatino por capricho quando é propício

[Verso 3: Stray]
A mentira vem à tona, flor de Lótus
Amor perfeito, semente do Demónio
Bebo para não sentir, clorofórmio
Palavras encravadas,espinhos no meu copo
Pálpebras com palitos, olhos de vidro à prova de tiro
Na prova de vinho eu provo o que me davam no ninho e provo que o meu sangue que não se verte sozinho
Confia em mim, eu vim lá do canil
Dá-me o cantil, sê difícil
Deixa o meu chuço, sai do meu prédio
Leva o meu mau tempo, deixa o meu mau génio
Sopra as nuvens do meu temperamento colérico
Eu sou perfeito, sou-te sincero
Pesa-me o espírito, homem mais forte do mundo
Lê-me o sina, diz-me quando é que eu me afundo
Venha à chuva, que se lixe se eu enferrujo
Eu fico bem assim com o meu pequeno brilho... sujo

[Refrão]
No meu caso não preciso
De fazer de conta que sinto que és bem-vindo
Eu não partilho este tinto nem que tingido
Eu desatino por capricho quando é propício

[VERSE 1]

As primeiras coisas primeiro mas eu não sei o que pôr em primeiro
Nunca fui bom a ordenar acho que isso é um fator derradeiro
Que dita a minha vida e que irrita
Todas as mulheres que entram na minha vida

Mas quando elas estão chateadas parecem sempre mais bonitas
Adoro quando franzes esses olhos e gritas, ya a sério
Este quarto desarrumado não é nada comparado
Com este cérebro baralhado

Quem critica quer comprar excepto os fãs de rap
E de ouvir tantas vezes a palavra eu já nem sei o que é que é wack
Faço rec e gravo a minha voz em casa
Abano a cabeça no metro, esse rapper tá em braza

Esse rapper é uma farsa por isso cobra pouco ou nada
Finge toda a noite e considera a conta paga
Saco da espada para defender-me de apertos e vaias
Mentira, só quero impressionar as samuraias de saia

A sério puto
Ainda me vais ver num viaduto
Vão-me fazer um tributo
Decretar dias de luto
Originar um culto
E usar o conteúdo
Das minhas letras
Estas tretas
Como material de estudo

Vou ser a razão do chumbo do puto do teu puto
E assim o fruto do teu fruto vai ser um bêbado bruto
Vão dar o meu nome a um produto absoluto
J-K, o comprimido mágico que cura tudo

Pelo menos era o plano, eu conquistar um planeta
O inseto bateu as asas na China, maldito efeito borboleta
Agora aceito uma valeta ou um banco de jardim
Agora escrevo a minha treta com um plano sem fim

Olhem pra mim, eu não estou assim tão mal
Até sou um bom exemplar de Neandertal
E se quiseres até podemos conversar e tal
Já ouviste falar do paraíso? Adivinha estás no alto

É só dares um passo e entras
Aqui tudo é agradável, não há zonas cinzentas
Mas há zonas violentas, complicadas e agressivas
Acho que passou o efeito da minha moca de auto-estima


[VERSE 2]

E ele nem toca só rima
Não faz nada da vida
Sempre aquela musiquinha, é sempre a mesma batida
E ele canta e desafina e ele bebe e desatina

E ele segue a sua vida mas a dor não suaviza
Mas de flores ele não precisa e das cores ele nem duvida
Que se foda a falta de guita
O que eu não tenho a mente fabrica

Já não me lembro do que é que eu era antes
Também não sei o que sou hoje
Mas sei que sou diferente do que era antes

Tenho memórias despertas mas não confio nas conversas
Porque o inconsciente editou-as, tornou-as mais poéticas
Lembro-me do primeiro beijo como se fosse ontem à tarde
Mas já não está tão clara a perda da virgindade

Já é tão tarde, já é tão tarde
Mais uma semana passou e eu com a mente por arrumar

Mas

Já é tão tarde ya, já é tão tarde
Mais uma semana passou e eu com a mente por arrumar

Mas

Fogo, já é tão tarde, já é tão tarde
Mais uma semana passou e eu com a mente por arrumar

Já é tão tarde, já é tão tarde
Mais uma semana passou e eu com a mente por arrumar

Já é tão tarde, já é tão tarde
Mais uma semana passou e eu com a mente por arrumar né

[Verso]
Ano novo, vida velha, não pode ser séria
Eu estou em histeria eterna, não pode ser regra
Eu tenho melancolia interna, não posso escondê-la
Por isso estou a oferecê-la em troca de companhia
Hoje acordei, ela sorria, quem diria?
Desejei-lhe bom dia
Sem resposta, rasguei a fotografia
Amanhã acordo sem lembranças para saudar
O que me deixa saudoso e com vontade de amar, azar..
Não preciso de solução, já sou solúvel
Não preciso de desaparecer, já desapareci
Sou uma borracha que já não apaga
Deixei de existir
Por isso não brinques com o fantasma que te acabou de mentir
Porque esta cama, Deus me perdoe, mas eu amo-a
Já passei semanas sem sair dela e sozinho
Duas almofadas, uma completamente inútil
A não ser que durma abraçado a ela
Mas isso é fútil

[Refrão]
Estou sozinho, mas não é por isso que não vingo
Seguro um (?) pelo colarinho
Estalo os dedos e brindo
Estalo os dedos e brindo
Estalo os dedos e brindo

(Shit)

Estou sozinho, mas não é por isso que não vingo
Seguro um (?) pelo colarinho
Estalo os dedos e brindo
Estalo os dedos e brindo

Estou sozinho, mas não é por isso que não vingo
Seguro um (?) pelo colarinho
Estalo os dedos e brindo
Como um sonho, brinco enquanto dono
Largo a coroa, queres-te sentar no meu trono?
Senta-te

Estou sozinho, mas não é por isso que não vingo
Seguro um (?) pelo colarinho
Estalo os dedos e brindo
Como um sonho, brinco enquanto dono
Largo a coroa, queres-te sentar no meu trono?
Senta-te

And my homie got the coca
And I’m always on that vino
And we rollin’ up the best dro

You can tell by lookin’ I’m good

You can tell by looking at my girl
She looking good

You can tell by looking at the crew

Oh, now what they sayin’? They mad
Oh, now what they sayin’? Don’t hear ‘em though

Now they screamin’ “Goin’ There to the top” baby, we know
This is the first year in the making
Y’all witness and her boy nervous and boy do it show
I don’t got time for no shakiness
No back down banner men at my side ready to go
I grew up in the 90’s with the Kid
And the Glove and the Reign I put on for 2-O

And I got ties in Hawaii that’s where my soul from
And aloha my spirit that air in my lungs
And this drive you should fear it this passion is young
But you hear it you know it this heart beat from

That up top, that north north
That west west, Northwesteros

Beat from that up top, that north north
That west west, Northwesteros
Ay man we on..

There you stand, here I go
Don’t ever gas me up
My own light tells me when that gas is low
Dealt with too many thots zero trust to go
Put your problems in the air I light the dro
Play them wicked games you dealing with a pro
You don’t wanna see how far this leash can go

Can’t believe these games you been playing
And these things you be saying to me tonight

You better think twice about what I’m doing
And who I’m seeing when I’m flying red eye on that

{Chorus}
Seatown to LA

See them lips got some intellect
And that tongue all on that bayonet
And girl yo booty real about to break the internet

Somebody called me on the phone
and told me I was gone
it's easy being paranoid
when I'm always on the run
and I wonder -
Where do I belong?

I took a trip to another city
and found myself in the sun
I hid inside a hotel
to be sure I came along
and I wonder -
where did I come from?

Open doors in my mind...

If I could fix my problem
for some shelter and a song
I'd be happy to turn me off
and never turn back on
and always wonder -
where did I go wrong?

I hear me talking words with meanings
hidden from my tongue
I'm just endlessly repeating
on and on and on
and I wonder -
where do I belong?

[Verse 1]
Sound like what, what, here's the break
Of the hearts that were recently made
The songs I sing, didn't hear them
But it's nothing that you can do

[Chorus]
'Cause California took my Bobby away
Now there's nothing left to do
'Cause California, you took my Bobby away
Now there's nothing left to say

[Verse 2]
You open up and you let 'em in
To a place where nothing ever grows
The ceremonies didn't keep him here
Didn't keep him here away from you

[Chorus]
'Cause California took my Bobby away
Now there's nothing left to do
California, you took my Bobby away
Now there's nothing left to say

Cosmic flower, tell me why
Your faded love keeps me satisfied
Floating around on a constant cloud

But I’m never coming down
All I needed was just one joy

He came from the streets
He's struggling to forget
But now he just can't sleep
Rolling in his bed
He's searching for the truth
Feel lost without a clue
Wasted in his room
He's always been refused

His shadow in his past
The weight on his back
He saw too much too fast
Children smoking crack
So damm hard to sleep

He never felt so sad
He knows that no one cares
Now it's too f**king late
He wrote his own fate

[Verse 1: Bwritten]
I bet you never thought of this
Bwritten got the mothafuckin’ “IT” factor
You can find me balling out like the Raptor
Or working down at Best Buy, making HSAC backwards
And no shame where I work at, cause in a year
When these student loans appear I’ll reverse that
Now, while ya home saying luck
I’m out here for a ride, yea, tailgating trucks
When I’m aiming for the bucks, I ain’t waiting for a creature
But still won’t make a sound like the class
When they first meet the teacher
Straight silent scrap, I make quiet facts
If they live, watch me hyphen that it's eastside

[Verse 2: Slawth]
Beer belly
Get the cheddar
Never bills stacked high
Lurking through the void ill-advised
Hills have eyes, Chef Slawth from the top
Let me show’em how the cream’s made
Hit the sack early, 'till they’re chirpin’ for my dreams sake
I arrived in my sun-soaked gillie
Suited for the winter
My dinner is rap-beef chili
Will they learn?
Or continue to feed the bottomless pit of dead rappers
And fading back to anonymous?
Kids assemble to be heard from the cheap seats
East bound, bring your feelings in a bucket to be kicked
Riverside, until every single leech feeds
And your soul will be freed to be hunted in the mist
Here it is

[Verse 3: 211Joe]
I’ve been called in for duty, ain’t playing games, no Call Of Duty
I’m the shit, you can call it doody. You smell me?
But hold up, let me switch it up you can say
I’m sick as fuck when
I’m spitting up tap out, go ahead and give it up
This is chess, not checkers
I’m calling check mate call and check on my mate
Our date at checkers at eight. Wai
Off topic you should know: I’m the top pic bald headed eagle
Soaring way above the ostrich
Headed to the top me and wifey in the cockpit, drop it
All that negativity stop it, or else your liable to be a hostage
So let it go, this ain’t a threat
I’m just letting know, it’s 211joe

[Verse 4: Cory Bugz]
Left the hood, now I’m coming off deadly
Collected myself and my soul is never ending
So now I rock this game like a pendant on my necklace
But gold chains ain’t up on my check-list
Scripting my life, a steady wordsmith
I’ve been told many times: ""This craft is worthless""
Many times I left class
Inserted emotions into my lines, inside of these rhymes
I find coping, I know this, yeah, it takes some work
Stop telling me what I’m doing
Yeah, I am my own person, coming up with a movement
You could see I’m not perfect
Steady making improvements, I am my endorsements

Make a provision for control
Your condescension isn’t bold
I never thought there would be anyone
I was right this time
As personality unfolds
Extract your fallacy with gold
I’m breaking up those sad bones
I never thought, i never thought...
And there’s so much here that I don’t wanna see
But you let it breathe
Do they shudder?
Do they shudder?
Do they not feel anything at all ?
Untie my conscience
Weightless as I leave
Face your intentions when you’re cold
Indistinction is your hole
I never thought there would be anyone
I was right this time
When personality takes hold
The sentimental distance falls
I’m breaking from these false hopes
I never thought, I never thought..
And there’s so much here that I don’t wanna see
But you let it breathe
Do they shudder?
Do they shudder?
Do they not feel anything at all?
Untie my conscience
Weightless as I leave

You cut away and you got away
Those antique promises won’t wait
You got away in those final days
And everything you loved
The pain you understood
All wasted time
Hold on to a lie, hold on to a lie
Feed me to the lions
Wasted time
Hold on to a lie, hold on to a lie
Feed me to the lions
That wait in line
You cut away and you got away
Those rested promises won’t wait
You cut away in your primal ways
And everything you loved
The pain you understood
All wasted time
Hold on to a lie, hold on to a lie
Feed me to the lions
Wasted time
Hold on to a lie, hold on to a lie
Feed me to the lions
That wait in line

You said our luck ran dry
The faded features of this night
Leave us unoccupied
The sullen reaches of your
Lonely Town
Lonely Town
Let’s set fire to this cellar ghost
Meet me on a wire
We’ll face off for sole rights
Meet me as it dies
Sever links inside
You said our luck ran dry
Those faded features in this light
Won’t let you compromise
The southern reaches of your
Lonely Town
Lonely Town
Let’s set fire to this cellar ghost
Meet me on a wire
We’ll face off for sole rights
Meet me as it dies
Sever links inside
You said our luck ran dry
(Minds fate, blind hate)
Meet me on a wire
We’ll face off for sole rights
Meet me as it dies
Sever links inside
Meet me on a wire
Concentrated old lines
Salivated sighs
Never linked inside

I’m into silence these days
Bored in the dark
I learn to bury this away
Sign into private recess
Born in the rot
It’s hard as the patience falls away
New start
New save
New silences
New start
New save
New sirens to fade
Your set disguise is no surprise these days
You’re telling me the sun is always out
You’re satisfied with tunnelled lives it’s as if we’re prey
Just let us swim in black water, your hands away

This indecision makes her full of doubt
You really turn those lights out
This small incision makes her whole inside
Pull me into your icehouse

Fear
Holds you dead
All i’ve said
Holds you dead

This recognition taken from the drowned
You’re turning to this spite now
This small addition makes her whole inside
Pull me into your icehouse

Fear
Holds you dead
All i’ve said
Holds you dead

Hold the terrors in now
Racing to the red light in your head
Fall with elegance
You’re testing faces in this silo
Hold the terrors in now
Fading still but glance my hands away
Hold the terrors in now

They turn the wheel
And force it out
They break down
Sell us our medicine
Drag us in
Terrified

Your turn to celebrate
My nausea’s so ingrained
My skin is crawling

I hear your full complaint
Write it up in sordid fate
My skin is crawling

They turn away
And focus on
Their red lines
Fed us our medicine
Head us in
Verified

Your turn to celebrate
My nausea’s so ingrained
My skin is crawling

I hear your full complaint
Write it up in sordid fate
My skin is crawling

"
147954,
147955,"

I'll leave it to the deft
To make a fire
We fake our doubt
Hate me, I'll search your brains
We'll litigate
Sighs, sighs, all around
Tell it to someone who cares
Show me indifference
Fights, fights
Whore it out

Cut it down, cut it down
Holy, innocent
For the law
Cut it down, cut it down
Always innocent, never your fault

Hold inner lights we dread
Your fickle fate
For those fallen out
Rated too low to matter
Spoken instead
Fire, fire, pouring out

Cut it down, cut it down
Holy, innocent
For the law
Cut it down, cut it down
Always innocent, never your fault
Cut it down, cut down
Holy, innocent
For the law
Cut it down, cut it down
Always innocent, never your fault

Her presence fades without
Anticipated doubt
I'll waste the night away with you
I'll waste it through
Her warnings never found
Intoxicated mouths
Are breaking out the night with you
In endless rooms
Incandescent lies for our stale minds
In this place that died you will always find
Your seven days all end the same
Your seven days all end the same
You never drew this out
Fall into covered ground
Interrogate the sound
I'll make it out of here with you
Hide in this truth
Incandescent lies for our stale minds
In this place that died you will always find
Your seven days all end the same
Your seven days all end the same
You never drew this out
How did you make it this far?
How did you guess?
Your losing time with this car
Time to impress
How did you make it this far?
I'm so impressed

I got that feeling from you
That you’d be so charming
But your plastic was masked
With human skin
And your body alone
Was quite disarming
Well even Adam and Eve

You’ve come so far in this crowded town
The taste is sour, but you stick it out
You feel afraid, but you’re braver than that
You’re all I got, in this ASTRAL SKY
 
The cityscape, you’d rather tear it down
‘Cause it’s so fake. Ain’t nothing safe and sound
In this place. You’ve got me founded out
I found out
 
Step off the curb
Check your purse
Ten dollars
ASTRAL SKY
Fake a smile
For a while
Your troubles melt

All I want are three words
Money, fame, and stardom
Chop me up
Touch my body
This Astral Sky will make you numb
This Astral Sky will make you numb
 
Oh Honey Kevin
He ain’t doing well
He’s hit the ceiling
And he’s gone to hell
He sold his soul
Well isn’t that swell?
I guess he’s not
In this Astral Sky
 
 
Make your money
Sell your soul
Hit the ceiling
Throw in the rope
 
Ask your parents
They have cash at hand
But they’re too tired
So stick it to the man
 
Crash the festival
Steal the show
Take the dagger
And sell your soul
 
Call me honey
A feast we’ll eat
Hit  the dance floor
Clap to the beat
 
In this Astral Sky
In this Astral Sky
 
If you want to go to the galaxy
Up in space, we’ll need lots of money
To find the right people
To take the right pill
To live forever, Ain’t that swell
 
If you want to go to the galaxy
Turn right on Dundas
And we’ll fly through the atmosphere
I’ll say I LOVE YOU, you’ll love me too
We’ll crash and burn

What Do U Know About Me?

"
148041,"

You know when you say you’re in love
But you’re not really in love
I guess it’s something about this generation
That’s got me begging temptation
You know it was hard to challenge myself
And open up to you
I remember when we were drinking and you basically flirted with this one guy, What was that about?
It was always complicated, I never said it wasn’t
You know it took a lot for me to come around
But when I knocked on your door, you didn’t make a sound
 
And you know
Its crazy
The way our
Hearts digress (didn’t make a sound)
Even though
Its Crazy
It matters
It matters less (come around)
 
And you know
I’m Crazy
I can’t face
Face the test (didn’t make a sound)
The pressures of
Life's crazy
It enough
I cannot stress (come around)
I cannot stress
I cannot stress
 
And I try, I try to be the best person I can be
But there’s something about you that affects me
And I know it’s hard, but won’t you answer me
I know you have your anxieties and delusions 
But open up to me

"
148042,"

Looking back, I was static it's true
I didn't have a shoulder to lean on
So I guess I didn't want to move

And when I thought I could comfort
You
When you seemed like a mosoleum
I thought I could just come running into you
And be safe, it's true

I guess I didn't know what fears me
I was caught up in the safety
But you, you wouldn't let me leave
I was sheltered, carefree

I was static, s-t-a-t-i-c
And I'm still a little stuck in the velcro
Set me free
Set me free
SET ME FREE

S-T-A-T, I see static
S-T-A-T-I-C, static
S-T-A-T, I see static

Your little bouts of loneliness 
Don't they eat you up inside
Inside?
 
I question what you told me
You loved me only
I was your closest friend
Now Say goodbye
 
I was your closest friend
Now say goodbye
 
Now say goodbye
 
 
I think it's funny
How We all separate
And all our friendships
They disintegrate
And all we've ever loved
Can turn to hate so quick
So quick
 
Are we human
Or we mad
A different species
Living with the baddest
Ailments. Mental ailments
In my life, In my life
 
I think it's pitiful
How we sit and dine
Being psychiatrists
(Waste our goddamn time)
Helping one person
We are so selfless
To someone so so so so selfish 
 
I think it's sinful
How we sit and whine
About a person
Who isn't worth my time
And am I worthless?
Am I flawless?
Am I a fake ass piece of shit?
Hun, get the message. 
 
I question all your selflessness
Your little bouts of loneliness 
Don't they eat you up inside

I fly
When I fly
Little stars they pass me by
They hate me
They make me cry
I wonder why

I wonder why

I didn’t see what everyone else seed
 
I had no truth, I had no destiny
I couldn’t believe the life you planned for me
 
And the train kept coming
And the ticket got lost, it flew away
The train kept coming
Coming to me
 
This train of thought won’t leave me
These dreams I dream won’t go
When I wake up
Nobody knows

But nobody knows
I could be so good

Nobody Knows

Nobody knows
 
I had no path, no choice, no truth to see
In the life I lived, I live so desperately
With a female’s thirst and a male’s appetite
I saw my way out, out  to live a good life

Well I born in a big town
Raised in the small crowd
Ask myself who am I to be if I stand out?
Growing up, I thought I was a disgrace
And as I got older, I tried to hide my face
I kept thinking I was inherently bad
Mentally imbalanced and it make me sad
And moving forward
Imma try to be a better dad
 
Well i got caught up in myself
I was feeling the plastic
I got wrecked, I got wasted
I was trippin’ flaccid
I was the picture perfect poster of trouble teens
Not really nice but not really mean
I was degenerate, stupid, I was a disgrace
But all I ever had was my fucked up face
At the end of the day, what can I say?
At least I had vanity and the world I’d made
 
And toward the shit you’d say
Look at yourself before you speak away

When will the beach sun melt my plastic skin away
Expose something more
When will the beach sun melt my plastic skin away
Expose something more beautiful, capable
Cause we all know we're fading
Dying light, dying light
Don't take my soul away
Take me away
Ay
And maybe then we'll stay
Maybe then we'll stay
Ay
What's the point of being so nervous
What's the point of being so stoic
We're all just fading
We're dying light

And we fall
And we cry
And we try
And we die
We move on
Run along
But I still can’t shake you

Understand
I don’t get
How you feel
Like a man
After all
That you put us through

Announcing
The newest trend in culture
Attention
The First world hunger
Somebody who wants a lot from the world

Dismissive
A passive rupture
A mistake
You cannot falter
The big break
The love that we made
The lives we’d create
Just fell down

Rushing through my rinse cycle
I hear the applause 
Im standing tall i'm scrubbing over my indelicate flaws
I ask my body what do you think you'll do today 
Mediocre. M-m mediocrity
The struggle
What do you do to me
The struggle
Wash all over me
Till I can't breathe
Till I can't breathe
 —
Deafening circumstances
The world grows dimmer
What once gave us hope
Clamours away
Into the silence
Getting high with a homeless friend
Having a panic attack in the Toronto Public Library
Falling asleep to Honeymoon
Waking up to you, ha ha ha
On my way to a tax consulting gig
Throwing a bottle of vodka at a nuclear reactor
Bawling my eyes out in Matthews Hall
And fearing the future once more
It's not as bad as it seems

Stranger once told me I'm a beautiful boy
I didn't ask for that power, I just seek and destroy
And I'll  keep proving everyone wrong cause I'm doing it right
You see I'm goodness by day, but I'm badness by night
 
Tell me what’s wrong
Why you hurting the boy
Why you hurting the boy
Why you hurting the boy
 
Tell me what’s wrong
Why you hurting the boy
Why you hurting the boy

Don't let these people make you so insecure
Why you listen to these fools, be your own hero
You can prove everyone wrong,  And Love can still feel so right
You gotta build your success, And watch it t-take f-light

Tell me what’s wrong
Why you hurting the boy
Why you hurting the boy
Why you hurting the boy
 
Tell me what’s wrong
Why you hurting the boy
Why you hurting the boy

Art is art
I needed that
I was losing my heart
Found myself in the dark
Loathing by my lonesome

This is the road
I chose to follow
I cannot stop creating
Till I’m hanging from the gallows

Fair is foul
Foul is fair
An opportunity appears
Don’t miss your chance
They hurt the boy
So be a man
Troy without the O
Is just try
Try to bring me down
Married to the craft
I’ll always be around

Looks like revenge is finally getting it on
I see, I see you misread my signs

Heaven of Heathens
Protect me, Oh God
Through this Heaven and Hell
Past the euphoric highs
And the lows that they sell
 
For when I reach my peak
Between life and my death
Will I still see light as bleak, weak
Earthly and wrecked
 
Wrecked?
Wrecked?
Wrecked?
Wrecked?
 
You don’t know what the world is coming to
Believe me, believe now or throw your soul away
And when the world ascends into the sky

But you contemplate and then disconnect me
I ask you to speak my name
But you’d rather worship fame

I saw Heaven
It’s not funny
I saw it with my own two eyes
 
And when I ascended upon the capitol
All I saw was their lies
 
I saw something lovely
I saw the Hollywood hills and skies
And the skies were buried
Beneath Plastic breasts and thighs
 
Ha!
 
I saw Hell, too!
It was built for disbelievers
And The soul I’d sold
Was priced and packaged for overachievers
And I fell! Yes, I fell
Just like the one who fell I witnessed
In this hell, and I turned to them, and I SAID to them

The first thing you see is the light
Then you focus on a man in a mask with a knife
As he cuts you away from everything you thought you knew about life
Now you're in your mother's arms, wrinkled and wet
You'll spend the rest of your life trying to hard to forget
That you met the world naked and screaming
And that's how you'll leave it

In Riverside Hospital, on a July morning
With a push and a pull, this is how I found out
I wasn't quite so invulnerable
It put the fear of God in me when I heard my daddy say
""one mistake is all that it takes.""

I ended up at Central School, 1993
And met a certain kid named Sarim at the library
He said, ""they're ain't nothing about this place that's elementary.""
I learned to play the guitar in the seventh grade
In order to convince everyone I was a renegade
That's when I learned, in Glen Rock
Everybody calls a spade a spade
I couldn't fool anyone
I couldn't even fool myself
I was just another book on the shelf, nothing else

[Verse 1]
I used to like walking with my eyes down
I'd sleep all day and fret away the night hours
But then I saw the sun and felt its light's power
And I found out the planet ain't no private house
Now I turn a brave bully to a shy coward
Make a loud lout silent as a quiet mouse
Then I make them hand over the white cloud
And then they're leaving me with a polite bow
And I've got plans I haven't time to write down
I'll incite a riot, fire flying all around
When I'm crying out, I'm howling with the wild hounds
Don't wanna buy an ounce
For me, the right amount is the entire pound

[Refrain]
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out

[Verse 2]
I don't chase after clocks or calendars
I bow down not to masters, gods, nor managers
Cause all the greatest artists, they were amateurs
Unembarrassed, dressed in only bandages
And I don't read rules or adhere to rituals
I'm an impatient underdog indivisible
And my challengers are talentless imbeciles
When my chalice is full, I am invincible
I don't listen to parents or priests or principals
Inconsiderate of little individuals
When they ration out their miniscule residuals
Shit by the fistful
As long as there's a law, I'll be a criminal

I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out

I turned it up to four and couldn't feel it
I turned it up to five, it wasn't real yet
Turning it up to six wouldn't reveal it
Seven was a secret
Eight was reaching
Nine was decent, but

[Outro]
I really liked it when it dimed out
I only really like it when it's dimed out
I like, ""like it"" like it dimed out
I like it, like it, like it, like it dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
Whatever's inside, let it climb out
That was his plan and it's mine now

I grew up on one side of the river
I was a disturbed, dangerous drifter
Moved over to the other side of the river
Now I'm a drop in a deluge of hipsters
Something a guy from the first side said:
""to die in a cipher, city to a cinder”
Male or female, beggars still the only ones calling me “Mister”

And some of my dreams are coming true
And some of the smoke from the other room is seeping through
And some other ghost in another tomb is screaming too

Black hole, open up wide
Your lost son is coming inside
Spaceship? Or a lifeboat?
Put me out, coach, I'm ready to float
Who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat
'neath a life that was so mundane?

And what would you expect from a guy like me
On a day such as Monday
When I know life begins at the moment
Of consumption?

So taxing on the dollars and the sense
Of deduction

And every cent I ever earned I spent
And I would again

It's easy turning me on
I'm nearly a robot
I've been building bombs
Bombs between beers and blowjobs
Lifeless automaton, feeling like a ghost
I don't know much but I know which side's buttered on my toast
From Jersey I come, but I pump my own gas
I'm a dirty bum, but I wipe my own ass
If you're chasing any other kind of currency, son
You're really doing little more than twiddling your thumbs

"

I ain’t gonna leave the building
Just lie here and stare at the ceiling
There’s nothing out there that can give me no healing
And right now I’m the only one that can hurt my feelings

I’m staying inside today
I’m hiding away
Oh yeah!

Let me tell you how it goes here in the big city
There ain’t no mercy and there ain’t no pity
And everywhere you turn there are hundreds of humans
All opening the door saying “Hello, Newman”
And hearing people hearing themselves talk
I tell you those are fingernails where there should've been chalk
I heard this one guy tell this other one to suck his cock
And he was the richest, smartest guy on the block

Oh, I, leave me alone
I, leave me alone
Oh no no no no no

‘Cause I just want to be alone
So don’t call me on the telephone
Why in the world would I pay T-Mobile
When every day’s the same, feeling antisocial
I’m minding my own business like I’m supposed to
So when I get home no one's coming over
Shot down dead red rover, red rover, yeah!

People try to confuse me
And people try to abuse me
And people try to frustrate me
And people try to castrate me
Uh-huh and people messing with my mental health
I tell you they just do it cause they hate themselves
And I've been walking around I'm try'na love myself
And I don't wanna talk to anyone else

You know, I, leave me alone
I, leave me alone
Leave me alone

I just want to be alone
I don't wanna drown amongst the droves of drones
I don't wanna hear that I'm what I own, oh no
I don't wanna feel my Y-chromosome
So don't look at me like I ain't full grown or
Welcome to the terror dome
Welcome to Hell
Welcome home

Lonely Boy coming down the street, better get out the way
The first person that he meets is probably going to pay
I'd say definitely
He woke up feeling like a loser, now he's itching to win
Yeah he did it yesterday, now he's gonna do it again
Hey - stay away
He hates to be awake
Stay away, he doesn't wanna hurt you
Stay away, he doesn't wanna hurt you
A lonely boy is an angry boy
A lonely boy is an angry boy

Eric!

Verse 1
She's looking after me
She doesn't know the kind of things I could do if I lose control
I'm letting out the beast
He's free, unleashed
Will she freak when she sees my capabilities?

PreChorus 1
Waiting at the drugstore, oh yeah
Waiting on the drug dealer all day
Waiting on some drug deal all the time
Waiting on a drugstore line
I got what I came to find

Verse 2
Hey! I've always been this way, and I ain't proud
But I might go insane if I can't say it out loud
Don't want her feeling sad from what she heard me say
Not even on my worst of my birthdays

PreChorus 2
Blame it on the drugs, yeah, oh yeah
I'm paying off the drug dealer always
Made it to the drug deal right on time
Now I'm waiting on one more line
I got what I came to find

Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw

I am the Electric Man
Yes, I am

I've got the electric band
I've got everything but the electric van
Electric Man's always got a helping hand for the motherland
But it makes it so hard to hold on to the metal can

""Come on Electric Man!""
I'm trying
""Yes, you can!""

[Verse 1]
Some days start with an earthquake
The bed shakes until it breaks
And I hate to be awake
Most days start with a dull ache
Enough weight to crush my face
And I hate to be awake

[Chorus 1]
Both ways are about the same
Making my mouth complain
Is pounding the trouser snake
So I just lie and count the chains
Assign them a thousand names
To praise their astounding strength
My portrait, proud and vain, hanging without a frame
On the wall of the house of pain

[Verse 2]
Fragrance of a pungent skunk
Hung in the repugnant
Dungeon where I have sunk
But I can't say it just once
Fragrance of a pungent skunk
Hung in a repugnant
Dungeon where I have sunk
Ooh it stunk

[Chorus 2]
Cowering in the glowering gloom
Ex-human left entombed, never to be exhumed
Remember the flowers in bloom just for an hour or two
Then back to the sourest mood
Forfeit the power to move
Total paralysis soon
None welcome to the
Ruins of my room

[Verse 3]
Door's closed and there’s no window
To this odious remote rodent hole
Inside we'd find the frozen ghost
But we won’t expose his decomposing soul
Flesh that roasts on smoldering coals
Blood that flows from broken nose
The moss that grows on rolling stones
Floating boats, the ocean throw and pull below

[Verse 4]
""The loser's movements are truly fruitless
The stupid student won't improve one bit
He refuses to do his tricks
Confused with the rudiments
Cruel unusual punishment
May prove prudent""

[Outro]
Hey! I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake
I hate to be awake

Tonight, two great ships will pull back to their ports
Depleted of everything that shoots flames and reports
And in the morning the shells will wash up on the shore
And the mighty of Earth will have no other recourse
But to shiver and shake and make shit in their shorts
Because we have been told that if you've been assured
There's a way to live the values your forefathers gave you
Prepare to be told, ""That shit's gay dude""
But I guess that what they say is true
And there is no race more human, no one throws it away like they do

The things I used to love I have come to reject
The things I used to hate I have learned to accept
And the worst of the three you now have to expect
Satan ain't hard to see you without craning your neck
He'll be seventy-some inches tall
He'll be chugging a beer and he'll be grabbing his balls
He's a remote explosive waiting for someone to call
He's just eighteen for now but hes going to murder us all

Solidarity's gonna give a lot less than it'll take
Is there a girl at this college who hasn't been raped?
Is there a boy in this town that's not exploding with hate?
Is there a human alive ain't looked themselves in the face
Without winking or saying what they mean without drinking
Who will believe in something without thinking
""What if somebody doesn't approve?""
Is there a soul on this earth that isn't too frightened to move?

I think the wrong people got a hold of your brain
When it was nothing but a piece of putty
Though try as you may but you will always be a tourist
Little buddy
And half the time, I open my mouth to speak
It's to repeat something that I've heard on TV
And I've destroyed everything that wouldn't make me more like Bruce Springsteen
So I'm going back to New Jersey, I do believe they've had enough of me

So when I leave Boston, my tail is between my legs
After deep cuts of patience and drunk to the dregs
And now I'm heading west on 84 again
And I'm as much of an asshole as I've ever been
And there is still nothing about myself I respect
Still haven't done anything I did not later regret
I have a hand and a napkin when I'm looking for sex
And that's no one to talk to when feeling depressed
And so now when I drink, I'm going to drink to excess
And when I smoke, I will smoke gaping holes in my chest
And when I scream, I will scream until I'm gasping for breath
And when I get sick, I will stay sick for the rest
Of my days peddling hate at the back of a Chevy Express
Each one a fart in the face of your idea of success
And if this be thy will, then fuckin' pass me the cup
And I'm sorry dad, no, I'm not making this up!

But, my enemy, it's your name on my lips as I go to sleep
And I know what little I've known of peace
Yes, I've done to you what you've done to me
And I'd be nothing without you, my darling, please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave

""Are we ready to go?""

[Intro: Okey Canfield Chenoweth III/Abraham Lincoln]
""From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe and Asia could not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio River or set a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we will live forever, or die by suicide.""

[Verse 1: Patrick Stickles]
There'll be no more counting the cars on the Garden State Parkway
Nor waiting for the Fung Wah bus to carry me to who-knows-where
And when I stand tonight, 'neath the lights of the Fenway
Will I not yell like hell for the glory of the Newark Bears?
Because where I'm going to now, no one can ever hurt me
Where the well of human hatred is shallow and dry
No, I never wanted to change the world, but I'm looking for a new New Jersey
Because tramps like us, baby, we were born to die

[Verse 2: Patrick Stickles]
I'm doing 70 on 17, I'm doing 80 over 84
And I never let the Meritt Parkway magnetize me no more
Give me a brutal Somerville summer
Give me a cruel New England winter
Give me the great Pine Barrens
So I can see them turned into splinters
And if I come in on a donkey, let me go out on a gurney
I want to realize too late I never should have left New Jersey
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
La da da da da da da da da da da, yeah!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
La da da da da da da da da da da, yeah!

[Verse 3: Patrick Stickles]
I sense the enemy, they're rustling around in the trees
I thought I had gotten away but the followed me to 02143
Oh, woe, woe is me, no one knows the trouble I see
When they hang Jeff Davis from a sourapple tree, I'll sit beneath the leaves and weep
None of us shall be saved, every man will be a slave
For John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave and there's rumbling down in the caves
So if it's time for choosing sides, and to show this dirty city how we do the Jersey Slide
And if it deserves a better class of criminal
Then I'ma give it to them tonight
So we'll rally around the flag, rally around the flag
Rally around the flag, boys, rally once again
Shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom
Rally around the flag, rally around the flag
Glory, glory, Hallelujah, His truth is marching on

[Outro: Nolen Strals/William Lloyd Garrison]
""I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject,  I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation. I am in earnest. I will not equivocate,  I will not excuse,  I will not retreat a single inch, and I will be heard.""

When you tell me that everything is alright
It's like a dagger
In my heart

And when you tell me that everything is just alright
It's like a dagger
A knife

Everything that comes our way
All of the seconds and hours gone astray
Can't keep up with them all
They're piled up in a corner of my room
Makes no difference to me
Let's burn another year in effigy

Hey!

Oh!
Time to kick it in the void

Things now are easier, fun and fair
It's nice to know that no one cares

Privacy and isolation
Unpaid parking violations
All strained romantic relations
The days that make up my life

I think I'll make a salsa
I think I'll eat a burrito
I think I'll fill my life with tasks that take about 30 minutes to complete

I think I'll drive in circles
I think this is going nowhere
I think this is all gonna repeat

Fantasy and actuation
A generation always on vacation
Feeling like the peak of creation
The days that make up my life

Fuck ups and frustrations
Good fortune has all been wasted
Losing time and losing patience
The days that make up my life

Lying naked, tangled in the sheets
Walk
To the window
Open wide

Gas stations passed
In the present day
In the morning light they're all blown away
Their faces
Have a restlessness that has both passed and still remains

And each step is a dagger in the ground
Everything is broken in its wake
Everything is broken, maybe that's okay yeah
Everything is broken, maybe that's okay yeah

Blown out
In the morning light

And piles on the corners where we stood once long ago

Mona woke up in a pile of ash
Tried to skip town but she didn't have the cash
At the bus depot in the middle of the night
She walked 'til she saw those city lights

And I met her at a house in D.C
She was living expensively
That's when she said to me
""Hey!
Write my biography""

""Hey man
Write my biography""

Then after that she was gone for good
No more walkin' around the neighborhood

Rubies from the fleshy bowl
Fingers reach inside to cup
My heart and knead my love to soul

Lingering on the edge of wonder
Clinging to a dream
The stream meanders
Hearing through the eyes of song birds
Singing winter's themes
The gleam surrenders
Waves left to metronome
Relentless heartbeat of the sea
One dream is over, another one begins
Lingering on the edge of wonder

Walking through the fields of clover
Breathing to and fro
The glow meanders
Staring at the far horizon
Pondering distant scenes
The dream continues
Wind, Aphrodite's violence
Sorry chorus of the years
One dream is over, another one begins
Walking through the fields of clover

[Verse 3]
Flying through the skies of night time
Nearing times refrain
The plane continues
Swimming through the clouds of rain drops
Endless wetness in
The pier caressing stars
Orion's flower god
Whatever God is of the sky
One dream is over, another one begins
Flying through the skies of night time

[Outro]
Wind, Aphrodite's violence
Sorry chorus of the years
One dream is over, another one begins
Lingering on the edge of wonder

"
148250,
148251,
148252,"

Sail over distant waters
Till you reach the honeyed shore
Walk on through purple flowers
Breathe the golden fragrance
You have reached the final island
Where dreams light up the daytime
You are at the end of journey
All is peace

Wine trickles down from mountains
Crimson streamers floating
Sweet meats hang from bushes
And ripely cry for plucking
Maidens gather flowers
And feed you with soft fingers
Hours are a song that never ends
Hours are a song that never ends

You can see love waiting inside the velvet cave
She calls you from the meadow
Her eyes are brightly shining
Her breasts are fruits she offers
So you leave the fields behind you
To follow promises she will fulfill
She will fulfill

In the cave there's no tomorrow
Nor any yesterday
Just the hammer of her heartbeat
As she draws you down beside her
And you sink down on the pillow of her body hotly loving
And you pray you'll never waken to the day
And you pray you'll never waken to the day

Never
Never
Never

Things have changed since mama held my hand real tight
And wind has blown since I had my supper tonight
Weeping willows always find a way to live
Unfortunate people always have a dime to give

Good times come along any way
I don't care what the people say
Do what I want to any way
Cause I don't care what the people say
I don't care what the people say

Many times I wondered how I was gonna survive
The trails above was involved with keeping myself alive
Sometimes I wonder just what's gonna happen to me
So I woke up my apples until I've shaken my apple tree

Good times come along any way
I don't care what the people say
Do what I want to any way
Cause I don't care what the people say
I don't care what the people say

Well good times come along any way
I don't care what the people say
Do what I want to everyday
I don't care what the people say
I don't care what the people say

Good times come along any way
I don't care what the people say
Do what I want to any way
Cause I don't care what the people say
I don't care what the people say

Oscillations, oscillations
Electronic evocations of sound's reality

Spinning, magnetic fluctuations
Waves of wave configurations
That dance between the poles off sound
And bind my world to soul

I walk the streets of moment
Head down to the ground
Cars are stars remotely far
My only world is sound
Passersby are worlds that fly
Far from the dance of time
Time whirls round from pole to pole
And swirls within the sound of...

Oscillations, oscillations
Electronic evocations of sound's reality

I wear my leather jacket like a great big hug
Radiating charm - a living cloak of luck
It's the only concrete link with an absent friend
It's a symbol I can wear 'till we meet again
Or it's a weight around my neck while the owner's free
Both protector and reminder of mortality
It's a curse - I cannot shirk responsibilities
From the teacher to the pupil it's a gift to me
So I love my leather jacket and I wear it all the time
I love my leather jacket

I'd look at you, and perhaps you'll smile at me
Loving my kaleidoscope world
The stars and planets just glide on by
Cold and patient like white gods' eyes
We smile a lot, loving our kaleidoscope world
It gets a bit cold so we turn on the heater
Things are great but that makes it neater
We'll never die in our kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in our kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in my kaleidoscope world (etc)
Kaleidoscope world
We go for a swim in the deep of space
A thousand colours reflect off your face
The stars surround us as we sail on through our kaleidoscope world
Don't need a red light bulb - I can see Mars
We've got a stereo and electric guitars
The sounds we make echo on through our kaleidoscope world
Like this...
If we were floating in a space capsule
I'd look at you and perhaps you'll smile at me
Loving my kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in our kaleidoscope world

We wander lost forgotten hills
Blue sky, green grass, we are still
The mists enfold us gently smelling
Breeze in our ears softly telling
Of the days of light and laughter long ago
They trace us, taste us, touch our hair
Show us a castle and show us to their lair - to their lair
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home
It's pretty cool but we can't rest
The purple sun sets in the west
We prance on gold - red summer lawns
Dragons-blood evening, the buzz of swarms
Of lawnmowers mowing summer lawns away, far away
I realise we really are quite far away, far away
Far away, far away
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home

Bands in backgrounds always play
Their phoney lonely cacaphony
It didn't have to be this way
Some place alone, yeah yeah
And no one known, yeah yeah
So far from home here, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Oohh oohhh, ooohh
I really didn't choose to leave you
To tear myself away so long
To travel and unravel all the fabric we'd sewn
So now something's wrong
And the world we used to know has gone
Some place alone, yeah yeah
And no one known, yeah yeah
So far from home here, yeah yeah
Years of awkward confrontation
I'd like to set your mind at ease
But stuck here in these muddled ages
I find the words won't please
Where could we dwell
Within our past alive and well
Escape from all that's hard to bear
To where the child that you were creeps near, without fear
Scary things aren't always clear
To hide in fiction and nostalgia can be eerie too
You cannot drive and stare rearview
Oohh oohhh, ooohh

Stay in bed till much too late
Scanning situations vacant
The face in the mirror looks withered and old
My skin is grey - I can't go out - I'm always cold
In the doledrums
On the dole
In the doledrums
On the dole
Counting down lonely hours
Drinking lots and taking showers
I no longer dream about the rest of my years
I'll check the letterbox - does anyone care?

Each evening the sun sets in five billion places
Seen by ten billion eyes set in five billion faces
Then they close in a daze and wait for the dawning
But the daylight and sunrise are brighter in our eyes
Where night cannot devour golden solar power

Once we were damned, now I guess we are angels
For we passed through the dark and eluded the dangers
Then awoke with a start to startling changes
All the tension is ended, the sentence suspended
And darkness now sparkles and gleams

And it all seems larger than life to me
I find it rather hard to believe

And so I stand and the sound goes straight through my body
I'm so bloated up, happy, I can throw things around me
And I'm growing in stages and have been for ages
Just singing and floating and free

Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit if anyone wants it
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
It's something that we're humming as we

Swoop low on trees or we sweep under carpets
We can dive into suns, though it's not recommended
We can hover silent and listen closely

It all seems larger than life to me
I find it hard to believe

So where was our home, well, our home was in tears
For its fruit had gone bad, they'd been that way for years
Yet their lives are elastic, they should be fantastic
They should be expanding

Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit if anyone wants it
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit for anybody
Oh, for those that still want it

Sitting watching clouds go by
Falling 'cross a very wide sky

Its the night of the chill blue and i'd
Like to say how I love you but it's
All been said in other songs
And if i try to say it new
Then i'll say it wrong

So I think of you, the only one I
Wish that it was just us two but
You and me and us - that's three

Twinkling stars over foreign lands
Silent camel train on desert sands

Its the night of the chill blue
And I hope to god you feel this too

I want to stop my crying
I want to stop my crying
But she's lying there dying
How can I live when you see what I've done?
How can I live when you see what I've done?

What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she's lost?
Just the thought fills my heart with Pink Frost

I thought I was dreaming
So I didn't heed her screaming
I'm so scared
I'm so scared
She won't move and I'm holding her head
She won't move and I'm holding her head

She's lost... Bye Bye Bye
She's lost... Bye Bye Bye
She's lost... Bye Bye Bye
Pink frost... Bye Bye Bye

I'm really not lying
I'm so scared
I'll have to stop my crying
Now she's dead

What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she's lost?

There's a part of me that's in disguise
Though I fight to see it won't arise
I'd avoid your eyes, denying
Something dark and primal surviving

I have another side i try to hide
It cannot escape because if it tries
There are defences raised around it
For i chose to keep it surrounded

Chorus
Got to stay on guard always, want to keep my caveman hidden
Everyone has some off days when we make bad decisions
Each man i've seen has some animal behaviour in him
Some can conceal better the male monster from the id

Got out, destroyed his cage
Saying thoughtless things with mindless rage
And i've seen him harm those i'm close to
With his charms he's so hard to see through

Chorus

I hurt you
I'm sorry
And i promise i won't do it again
And i'm mending all my errors
I really am

But my Mr Hyde he lies and lies
It'd take a Superman to supervise
But imagine all the damage
If the hidden man that took lives (?)
In Forbidden Planet survives

I'm not like that every day
I'm not normally that way
You need convincing i can tell
I don't say this very well

I'm sorry
I hurt you
And i promise i won't do it again
I'm mending all my errors
I really am

The male monster from the id
The male monster from the id
The male monster from the id
The male monster from the id

In this suburb of Babylon, they don't like to wait
They kill the messenger 'cos the message was late
They kill the child starving at the gate
Predicting the ruin of the state

See Willy fly by, in the by and by
In the never you mind, in the dollar store light
In the there you go, in the the wait and see
In the us and them, in the them and us, in the them and me
He's the exception that proves the rule
That all your dreams are a lie
How much will you swallow when Willy flies by?

There's something rotten round here, yeah nobody forgot
All the rest on the bottom, white men still on the top
Walk and talk with Suzie, shoot to cripple and maim
Shoot to kill again and again and again

Gonna build me a house, on a mountain so high
Gonna sit in my car and stare up at the sky
The dream is a lie, I'm gonna put it to the test
One man rising up on the backs of the rest
On the backs of his family, all the duds and the does
'Til the sun melts his wings and down we all go

See Willy fly by, in the by and by
In the never you mind, in the dollar store light
In the there you go, in the wait and see
In the us and them, in the them and us

History is written by the winner
This is a loser’s song
I took this job in the summer
Never saw the winter rollin’ on
Never thought it would end in a second
A burned out smoking wreck
Expectations & ambitions
We’re just a rope around my neck
Broke my back to earn a crust
Saw my dreams die in the dust
Now I’m walking on hell’s roof looking at the flowers

All in bloom, red yellow & blue
So sweet & true, nothing better to do
I’m not hiding come and find me
What am I doing, there’s no need to remind me
I’m walking on hell’s roof looking at the flowers
In the A to B & the miles per hour
Keeping out of reach of that higher power
Where the bees are buzzing in the April showers

The spoils belong to the victor
This is a consolation song
Your life is science fiction
A flash of light & you’ll be gone
No more trials & no more trouble
Bad luck & bursting bubbles
Walking on hell’s roof looking at the flowers x2

We’re not hiding come & find us
What are we doing there’s no need to remind us
Walking on hell’s roof…. x4

The slime runs down the coast and covers everything in sight
The teaming hordes from invading lands choke the beach out with their deadly blight
They take root everywhere and won’t clear out until September
We need an inconvenient truth to make some genocidal weather

As the icecaps melt
Into the sea
It’s the end for you
More room for me

Killer waves and monster surf
Wipe out everybody on this Earth
Finally the beach is mine
Looks like it’s finally time for
Killer Waves

As Mother Nature plots her revenge I’ll be waiting on higher ground
Until a tsunami wipes out all the invader in my boardwalk town
So when the big one comes I’m afraid you won’t be missed
It’ll be just me and the sea and you’ll no longer exist

As the icecaps melt
Into the sea
It’s the end for you
More room for me

Killer waves and monster surf
Wipe out everybody on this Earth
Finally the beach is mine
Looks like it’s finally time for
Killer Waves

Killer waves will clean the slate
Killer waves – your only fate

The midnight hour rolls around
And I catch the bus downtown
I crawl through the city streets
With all the twisted freaks

The room fills up so quick
With all the perverts and the lunatics
I crouch down low in my seat
And watch tonight's midnight movie

I want to see so much gore it makes me sick
I want to see death by a crucifix
I want to see a celluloid acid trip
At the midnight movies

You'll catch me down at Waverly
Seeing all the things I’m not supposed to see
I just keep focused on the screen
I get my fill from the projection machine

I want to see so much blood it makes me sick
I want to see divine eat some shit
I want to see the eraserhead baby hiss
At the midnight movies

I lead a lonely life of solitude and pain
Depression halting any chance of hope inside my brain
I fantasize what you despise
My heart is on my sleeve
I’m overdrawn my mind is gone
And i think we’d better leave

Bad bad bad bad biology
Its bad bad bad bad biology
And i don’t care who goes down with me
Its bad bad bad bad biology

I go to dives and take the lives
Of the ones that dare to touch me
An hours passed so soon at last
And I’ll shit this life inside me
Genetic freak a fucked up creep
(My goddamn way of life)
Well god himself chose me you see
So I’m going to fuck you until you die

Bad bad bad bad biology
Its bad bad bad bad biology
And i don’t care who goes down with me
Its bad bad bad bad biology

One day there was a voice in your head
You screamed in terror when you heard what it said
No hell below, no paradise divine
We're all from dust and we're nothing when we die

It whispers in your ear every now and then
You try to shut it out, It's always chiming in
It's getting louder, harder to ignore
You can't pretend you dont hear it anymore

The other side of darkness - the one you truely fear
There's no one watching over all of us down here
The other side of darkness - the one that you can't face
It's the color of cold and endless space
The other side of darkness
The other side of darkness

So say your prayers if it'll ease the pain
Or make you think that this is not in vain
Just because you wish it so for you
Doesn't matter or make it true

You'll sleep as you did before
The eons of time before you were ever born
Oh what you'd give to have the Devil back
When the light stood for truth and the Evil was black

The other side of darkness - the one you truely fear
There's no one watching over all of us down here
The other side of darkness - the one that you can't face
It's the color of cold and endless space

No second chancess
No Final Reward
No higher purpose
Nothing for the other side of darkness
The other side of darkness
The other side of darkness
The other side of darkness
The other side

I woke up today
And don't feel quite myself
There’s something on my brain
Sent on a mission straight from hell

Now I’m speaking in Sumerian tongues
There’s a demon singing to me
This is not a Hallucination
Science won’t let me see something

I’m just a conduit
I’m a fuse that’s about to be blown
I think I’m gonna like it
A night ride into the dark unknown
I used to see them on my shoulders
One in red and one in all white
The one in rec crawled in my ear
And I’m pretty sure the other one died

"
148973,"

I'm always sick I know they'll never find a cure
The stomach bile's just the promise of a future cancer
Ill choke the acid back and just get by
And I'll avoid thinking about how soon I'm gonna die

But if they had a remedy if they somehow find a way
To end this anxious nausea or just keep it at bay
When they'd peer in my insides I know just what they'll say
It's Neon Gray

I'll die alone I know that there's no fucking doubt
I know I'll never find someone who gets what I'm about
I've tried but it's the same all in the end
They want to take so much I know I can never let them in

And if I can find someone who can take my nervous hand
Calm my bastard temper and maybe somehow understand
When she'd look into my eyes, she'd see in my dull gaze
It's Neon Gray

Neon Gray, Neon Gray – you're a broken human being
You're a thing you shouldn't say
The medication wears off by the darkening of the day
Every day that you breathe air it's Neon Gray

I've thought about ending it all so many times
Spinning awake each night I plan it all out in my mind
I've fantasized about how the hell and when
But I can never do it no matter how much I intend

The same thing that drives me to utter misery
It won't let me end my life, no, not so easily
The fear of the unknown will drag me to my end of days
It's Neon Gray

I swore that I'd make good on the dreams of my forgotten youth
Although no one believed me if you want to know the truth
I would dive off of the cages just like the Superfly
I thought it was my destiny but in time it was a lie
Yes I would get the girls and I would beat the rest
And I would finally get that big red heart tattooed upon my chest
Ten pounds of gold around my waist that says that I'm the best
But we all know that it was not to be

Now I'm a monster - my body's been destroyed
Yet here I stand - still gainfully employed
Ready to maim myself for the masses to enjoy
It's all in a hard day's work for Mrs. Foley's baby boy
Mrs. Foley's baby boy
For Mrs. Foley's baby boy
Mrs. Foley's baby boy

Leon broke my nose and severed off my ear
So when the nurse asked me if it was real I couldn't even hear
The barbs from crowds more painful than those that hang on wires
I have this sacred calling nothing else could drive me higher
Well the tacks go in and the blood comes out
And I'll never get the girls with my two front teeth knocked out
A needle in my spine means I can fight another bout
And take a guess when that next bout will be

Now I'm a monster - my body's been destroyed
Yet here I stand - still gainfully employed
Ready to maim myself for the masses to enjoy
It's all in a hard day's work for Mrs. Foley's baby boy
Mrs. Foley's baby boy
For Mrs. Foley's baby boy
Mrs. Foley's baby boy

Sold out every night
Lon Chaney in tights

Now I'm a monster - my body's been destroyed
Yet here I stand - still gainfully employed
Ready to maim myself for the masses to enjoy
It's all in a hard day's work for Mrs. Foley's baby boy

Wish I could hit my head wake up this [?] season
But I’ll never be back, no matter how much I wanna
Cause there never ever can be another Madonna

The party ended as soon as the streets were cleared off the trash
I miss the l-train and the ride to Rockaway Avenue
There’s nothing left here to destroy
So take me to Detroit
Take me to Detroit

Please tell someone to cut off the life machine
Let that long note ring on the ekg
There's no medicine science hasn't found remedy
Please tell someone to cut off the life machine

Slings and braces try to fix what's torn apart
They can't erase the pain inflicted on my heart
Fade to black, fade to black, fade to black, fade to black
Too late to call the ambulance for my heart

Can't let go of you, times not helping me heal
Crashed my car and you're still there spinning the wheel
I need medicine but I haven't found remedy, bring you back to me
Took the anesthetic but I can still feel

Slings and braces try to fix what's torn apart
They can't erase the pain inflicted on my heart
Fade to black, fade to black, fade to black, fade to black
Too late to call the ambulance for my heart

Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no
I’ve falling for you
And you’ve been acting so strange
Can’t make you behave
Am I normal
Am I normal

[Verse 1]
It’s so hard to figure out what planet you are on
Venus and Mars have a connection
If you're normal and I’m not well that makes me a freak
Babe crock my heart cause your talk is cheap

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t know what I was thinking
Close my eyes, why I’m not dreaming

[Chorus]
Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no
I’ve falling for you
And you’ve been acting so strange
Can’t make you behave
Am I normal

[Verse 2]
You act so pristine but your clean gloves hide dirty hands
Begging for more than a second chance
I tried everything I could, I wanted it to last
But you wanted a barbie doll romance

[Bridge]
Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no

Promise the moon and I’ll believe ya
No I don’t care if I’m a dreamer

In a bed amongst the storms
Where the tide will crush your bones
In the dirty water
We are slipping under

When the madness rings our ears
Will you drink away my tears?
I just wanna have you
Tell me that you want to

With your spark that turns to gold
And your eyes that bare your soul
Does it really matter?
Tell me what you're after

[Chorus]
Lights out baby now
You're mine, don't fall behind
I love to feel you all o-ah-over, over
Don't care what you do
I'll light the fire inside of you
And we can make an explo-ah-o-sion

Ooh oh, oh-oh
Ooh oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Even when you've gone too far
Will always have my heart
I will hold you closer
Than I ever held you

And he knows where this will be
But it's not too hard for me
You're the one to fight for
I will always want more

Lights out baby now
You're mine, don't fall behind
I love to feel you all o-ah-over, over

Just let it breathe
Beautiful if you ask me tend to analyze
That's a part of my thoughts that I don't glamorize
If Jay Z and Beyoncé got that lemonade
Then me and you was a better grade Minute Maid
I'm from a place where they controlling that reefa growing to teach ya
Lyrically he colder than Keisha good lord
And y'all ain't half as nice
Blogging is dead let's enjoy the After life
Like a weapon see me reppin y'all could get wit
Like old school Martin get the stepping, fit bit
That's a side bar, what y'all rhyme for
Why religion stay diving my people
It's no peace just forever war simile's are better or life is like a metaphor

Doing it for you for you for you baby
My highs my lows my eyes are closed I feel I know

Lost my mother and brother felt like the same year
I'm pinching myself like why I'm still here
Am I still here, am I still here
[Bridge: Stephanie Heaghne]
I'm just so full of stress I'm just tryna feel blessed
I'm just tryna feel the opposite I'm tryna make it I'm tryna make it
I'm sick of the hurt my smiles into frowns that's my fault
Like the beat just had a break down
I'm sick of young gangs that stay with the pump, they saying dumb things
Like ten Donald Trumps
See I, been bottled bad happens to good people
Alotta poverty homie listen but that's the sequel
That's a side bar, what y'all rhyme for
Why religion stay diving my people

Starting out from Ferraday like a runaway bus
Moving north toward Memphis in a cloud of highway dust
Rolling to the rhythm of a sound he never hears
He's possessed by something which never comes quite clear
Although it might be coming from above
It always brings him down
I'm sorry Mr. Phillips about Presley and the rest
But as you know I'm Elmo's boy, I'm different from the rest
From Tupelo to Natchez they all answer to my name
Their belief in God above is driving them insane
And if I die before I wake, there'll be no soul left to take
Hellfire is a-callin' like a leper come a-crawlin'
Kicking down the doors of your life
Yeah, the women and the wine are just gigs you left behind
They ain't gigs when they's your life
Hellfire is a-bawlin' like some baby come a-crawlin'
Kicking down the doors of your life

Looking for Lewis and Clark

I was standing alone in Mabuhay Gardens
(Looking for Lewis and Clark)
I was thinking about the late Tim Hardin
Well when Tim gets to heaven, hope he told Gram
About the Long Ryders and just who I am
Yeah, no one gave Tim reason to believe
So he just packed his bags to leave
Looking for Lewis and Clark
Looking for Lewis and Clark
He was looking for Lewis and Clark

I thought I saw my government running away with my heart

You can find them in the Yellow Pages baby

She’s got the eyes of a snake- loaded dice- raising stakes from a cash cow
I’ll be her burn victim- hypothermic- so damn hot
Come to smiling like I blacked out in Glasgow
I woke up in the name that I wore last night to the sound of an empty bed
And it’s ringing in my ears just like sweet nothings from the voices in my head

[Chorus]
Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Don’t ask me what I mean
Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord

She’s got the touch of an anesthesiologist- please put me under
Because I tremble with the notion that there’s something unsaid
But numb my head I’ll mumble reticently I wonder how I
I woke up in the middle of my surgery and I watched them botch my heart
Only the second worst thing that I could’ve thought was
“This won’t have to end if it doesn’t start.”

[Chorus]

I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know what it’s like
What it’s like to love you
I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know what it’s like
What it’s like to love you

Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Heart blue-er than my balls
Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Just say that it’s on me

""Quick while she turns her back, slip it in""

I’m in a meat-pack plant by the gutterside
A slaughterhouse apartment with a slice of lime
I’m cruisin’ with the bruisers, boozin’, I’ll be a suitor, losing my mind
Because there’s nothing to find

The fetid stench of bad intentions hangs in the sweat
I’m in a sauna hot with drama and I’m tryin’ to forget
All the masochistic rapture mis-steps
Imminent pleasure’s ready to cut. To the bone

[Chorus]
You said “let loose!” But now you’re lost
While I tied my boots like a tightrope noose
The problem chased the taste of the cause
While the evidence supports the truth. Is 80 enough proof for you?
Here’s to my lady and I’m coming inside
Drink to me baby, and what’s left of what’s right
It’s easier to use and lose than never to have used you
On a fucked up Saturday night. Good times on Front Street


Loose lips sink ships, but captain, will you go down?
Float your boat and overboard and hoping to drown
Tell me what prevented you from coming downtown all alone
Because we know you’re not afraid

This chastity is Greek to me, the meat is still fresh
The gnashing teeth will masticate the bones from the flesh
Since nobody will tell me where these bastards go, I’ll see for myself
I think they might go to hell

[Chorus]

LAST CALL FOR MORALS
BETTER COVER YOUR DRINK
SODOM AND GOMORRA’D
LET IT GO DOWN THE SINK

Good times on Front Street

To cut down on my silhouette, my favorite foods are smoke and hearts
My leftover frets forget stiletto-self vendettas, while my cracking backbone lacks but backs up my false starts
All nightmares start as dreams and I hear my subconscious screaming
They say that beauty’s just skin deep, so naturally, please show me your-

[Chorus]
Bones, bones, bones. Let me see your bones
Well I don’t wanna know if the feeling follows home
Bones, bones, bones. Hell, we’re all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your bones?
​

Lumps in throats and petticoats, your baby teeth would pray for you
A selfish book is always open, and some of the best liars only want the truth
All love starts as a scheme, so wake me up, I’m tired of sleeping
They say that beauty’s just skin deep. So rip it off and please show me your

[Chorus]

All nightmares start as dreams, all love starts as a scheme
Give me all your LSD so I can feel my mind unweave again
They say that beauty’s just skin deep
So Ana stands and rends the rancid meat from her

Wild goose or holy grail?
Red herring or the great white whale?
Not many live to tell the tale
Little things that just don't matter still could get me as mad as a hatter
Hot shit on a silver platter
I let go and i float away
A million miles in a couple of days
I just came back here to say goodbye

Birds fighting in mid-air -
& all the sky is theirs
Theirs: all of the sky -
Yet they peck another's eye
Free as a bird...
Or is that just a word?
Oh, to be free -
To free myself from me

"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I know the aether can never claim the Earth
Atmospheric gasses cannot remain with dirt
We purchase pleasure, pay for it with hurt
And we rarely get our money's worth

[Verse 2]
See how we grasp at the stars?
They're so far away, you can't even see what's right in front of you
Flesh wounds heal, broken bones mend
But you're not my friend
I never want to see you again

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I never want to see you again
I never want to see you again

[Outro]

"
150133,"

I'll see you on Mars
In the floods among the stars
Everybody's lost their head
Gotta move your tail instead
I'll see you on Mars
In the dark and dirty bars
How I love that Martian sound
When you're playing loud and proud
Oh baby you've got skeleton power
Just waiting at the top of your tower
With the long blank stare
I'm sailing on a slow boat to China
Why should I care
I'm sailing on a slow boat to China
Oh mama you just do what you will
Check out and then you send me a bill
From a dull nowhere
I'm sailing on a slow boat to China
Why should I care
I'm sailing on a slow boat to China
And I'm all
Yes I'm already there

When the dream comes to an end
& I wake up once again
It's no surprise anymore
When the knock comes on my door
& I go from place to place
& always see your face;
But you're not there anymore
When the knock comes on my door
So I stayed awake all night
Trying to think things right
& I'm down on the floor
When the knock comes on my door

"
150137,"

They say ""Hold on to your dreams""
That plays good on TV, but never worked for me
So now I need to find a way to occupy my time
Until the day I die because I give up
It's gone so wrong so long, it's gone so wrong
So long; I give up

Wizard's kiss, dragon's breath
Pot of gold payable on death

You think you're on the winning team
But it's no game, though it just might be a dream

Highest hill to lowest pit
If you ain't got love, you ain't got shit
'cause it's your life to live or to lose
I'm tired of singing the death culture blues!

Now we're told just to get in line
And bowo down the almighty dollar sign
Battle turns from left to right
But I'm not going down without a fight

I've done my time, I took my bath
I'm back on track down the shining pathy
'cause it's your life to live or to lose
I've tired of singing the death culture blues!

"
150139,"

You turn me on and it's hard to turn me on:
Mornings I tell you what I dreamed
Before we're swallowed by the work machine
And spit out in the evening drained half dry
And that is why you turn me on and it's hard to turn me on
We traveled many miles to no guarantee
Everything's a joke to you; it's not that way to me
And Walt Disney cannot make me happy, cannot make me go along
But you turn me on and it's hard to turn me on

"
150140,"

The summer sun stood up in the sky
& looked back down like it's some kind of eye
""I've got nothing to hide,"" I said out loud
But I feel much better when I'm under a cloud
So I climbed up the hill of all I've destroyed
& looked out into the gaping void
But all I could do was stand & stare
Though just one more step could have taken me there
Oh, someday we'll meet beyond the moon -
Someday soon

"
150141,
150142,"

It's raining, it's raining - there's nothing you can do
It doesn't only rain on you
But you're acting all upset
Like you're the only one who's wet
It's raining, it's raining - there's nothing we can do
It's raining on me, too
You man & you cry
But that won't affect the sky
You're not a saint, you're not a saviour
Or a devil, it's agreed
Oh lucky you, oh lucky me -
We've had more of those than we need
It's raining, it's raining, & I can't tell you when
This storm is going to end
So go ahead & cry
But that won't keep you dry

[Verse 1: Sam Coomes]
Everday
We earn our meager pay
But it takes its toll
To play the happy prole

[Verse 2: Sam Coomes]
They buy your labor
Try to steal your soul
Bite the bullet
Hold your tongue
And play the happy prole

[Verse 3: Sam Coomes]
Paranoid and tired
Quit before you're fired
But they've got you in the hole
So you play the happy prole

[Chorus: Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss]
You need the money
So you got to play it dumb
But if you play it long enough
It's just what you become

[Verse 4: Sam Coomes]
Pay your rent
Pay your bills
Pay the doctor for your pills
So you can work another day
As life slips away

Sure the one I'm waiting for
But i just can't know for sure
That it is worth even getting into anymore


Sure the one I'm longing for
But i just can't tell if it is your life
That i can get into anymore

Said that i feel alright, i feel alright in your eyes
You know that you feel alright, that you feel alright in my eyes
You said  that i feel alright, i feel alright in your eyes
You know that you feel alright, that you feel alright in my eyes
You know that you feel alright, that you feel alright in my eyes


Sure the one I'm longing for
But I don't know anymore if its is even worth getting into

Now, I've lost your whereabouts
But I didn't know even how it is even worth getting into

Said that i feel alright, i feel alright in your eyes
You know that you feel alright, that you feel alright in my eyes
You said  that i feel alright, i feel alright in your eyes
You know that you feel alright, that you feel alright in my eyes

[Verse 1]
So here we are inside the dream
Where dark is broken by the light
Paint my face in bleeding colour
Just to dream in black and white
Have you ever kept a secret
That turned out to be a lie?

[Chorus 1]
I caught you talking to the little voice inside your head
I just listen you’re the one who talks in tongues she said
I’m tired of waking up and staring faith face to face
If there’s a finish line then I ain’t part of this human race

[Verse 2]
So here we are inside the dream
Hard to tell how far we’ve got
You’ve always called me heaven
But you don’t believe in God
And have you ever kept a secret
That turned out to be a lie?

[Chorus 2]
I caught you talking to the little voice inside your head
I just listen you’re the one who talks in tongues she said
All the apples in the family tree have fallen from grace, erased
If there’s a finish line then I ain’t part of this human race

[Bridge]
I just had a dream
You were holding the heart of a pig
A truth never changes and that remains the proof
Everything changes and that's the only truth

[Chorus 3]
I caught you talking to the little voice inside your head
I just listen you’re the one who talks in tongues she said, she said
I’m tired of waking up and feeling like it’s all to late, to late
If there’s a finish line then i ain’t part of this human race

Everybody's asking, where you go at night?
And though there's too much speculation
I wonder if there's sense in estimating
The distance
Between the clouds of Venice
Oh there's too much desperation
All night appetite

Heaven have you got us winner this time?
I've been going to gate just to see him
Play a simple, Wiolyn
Heaven I've been waiting all of this time
Just to get a good look and listen
To his simple Wiolyn

In Daniel's book it's Michael
Who loyally remains
Out on the corner, at the end of days
Michael
What's frivolous and what remains?
When there's no more distinction
Between the clouds of Venue
When there's no more emanation
All of it spent

Heaven have you got us winner this time?
I've been going to gate just to see him
Play a simple, Wiolyn
Heaven I've been waiting all of this time
Just to get a good look and listen
To his simple Wiolyn

It took all of me
To resist my own kind
And yet to you it came so easily
How am I supposed to choose and define?
With all your sentimentality

No more dissonance
Clouds of Venice

No more friction
No more fight

All will change
All remains
All is one
One's the same
All will change
All remains
All is one
One's the same
All will change
All remains
All is one
One's the same
All will change
All remains
All is one
One's the same

Missoula, Missoula
I'm gonna find her and bring her back to me
Missoula, Missoula

I see Tony, say ""What's happening?""
Well I came to old Missoula with a shotgun filled with lye
Beware, beware keep your garden fare
Let no man steal you thyme

Missoula, Missoula
Who's that Ruby Ringer hanging off your ear?
Missoula, Missoula
Take your babies
Take them far from here

Well I came to old Odessa for a dark and honest touch
Beware, beware keep your garden fare
Let no man steal your lunch

Then she said, ""Let's get going""
And we'll be out by dawn
It's the curse of the roaming
It's the curse of Missoula

Missoula, Missoula
I'm gonna find her and bring her back to me

I went down to twenty nine palms
To buy me some time
Rolled down in the clover
To buy me some time
And then I wonder, what am I buying time for
When there's no time coming in?

He's been here since 7:15
Just buying some time
Shall I wear my hair behind?
And buy me some time
And then I wonder, what am I buying time for
When there's no time coming in?

Grace she holds her fan just like any other man
You know it's true
You know he wants her too
In all her late blooming

That's not what I meant at all
When buying some time
Take me to your dance floor
To buy me some time
And then I wonder, what am I lying here for?
Hello windows, hello walls

Grace she holds her fan just like any other man
You know it's true
You know he wants her too
In all her late blooming

Oh, how he wept, he's not to blame
I'm not the one who told you lies, Claudine
I'm not the one who told you lies

And the nights, they know how to fill it
In the cold room holding scents of his
I'm not the one who told you lies, Claudine
I'm not the one who told you lies

I'm not the one who told you lies, Claudine
I'm not the one who told you lies

Gave you the best they knew how

Called on a Wednesday
Oh what a shame, he's gone away

I'm not the one who told you lies (where do we go?)
I'm not the one who told you lies
I'm not the one who told you lies (where do we go?)
I'm not the one who told you lies

She's never coming home
And she's never coming home now

You tried to tell me something that I
Didn't want to know
You tried to tell me something that I
I felt was preloaded
Oh the only one
Who makes out from what's to come
And oh the anyones
They really wanna be like me

Do easy
Most of the Time
When I'm alone
Conducting mind
With ease
Like a poet [?]
Self help for a stealthy blow

I saw you cleaning out the boxes by your basement bed
That you usually hide
I saw you sweeping out the crumbs of your deludedness
And I guess I never noticed
All the anyones so defined by what's to come
And oh the only ones
Take stock in what they see

Do easy
Most of the Time
When I'm alone
Conducting mind
With ease
With ease
Like a poet [?]
Self help for a stealthy blow

Do easy
Like a poet [?]
He felt it so fine
He wrote it in prose
With ease if you're so inclined
Cultivated now his sense of mind

Won't try to sign
Lay down the blame
She's been waiting so long
She thinks like a ghost

Will he ever come back
Oh won't you come back
Come back
Come back
Oh won't you come back
Come back
Come back
Oh won't you come back

Do easy
Like a poet [?]
Do easy
[?]
Do easy
Do ease
Do ease
Do ease
Do ease
Do ease
Do ease

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
No limit, I'm a fucking soldier, ayy
Always lit, yeah, I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rocks, she act like it's a boulder, ayy
'Rari, shopping, let me, cop it
Always, poppin', hella, poppin'
She's a, bopper, homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping, album, dropping
Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired

Ho stirring up the pot, jambalaya

Fuck the Moët, buy the Ace, fuck the Ghost, drive the Wraith
Get some money, flood the Rollie, fuck the Rollie, Patek face
My career takin' off, these hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth, how these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs? Bitch, I ain’t Jared
If you really want some smoke, you can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make your nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Sazón, I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club 'til the end from the start
You know me, Cardi B, pussy poppin’ on the charts, ah, ah!

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, it ain't nice, fam
You can study where I'm from on my Viceland
This is nothing new to me, this my life, fam
I can pull a million girls from a mic stand
Pull one at my show 'cause I like fans
Later on, I got two in my night plans
Man this year, I had 300 one night stands
Keep a Costco pack of rubbers in my night stand
Damn Daniel, back again with the, hah, Saint-Laurent
Ayy, they send me product, yeah, it's retarded
Ayy, this was free, ayy, bitch you bought it
Bitch you on my dick, ayy, bitch get off it

It ain't a simple case of bad luck

[Verse 1: Son Little]
Ain't like when it snows and you get your car stuck
This is a bonafide terrible lie
But you could call it whatever you like
('cause everybody knows what's a genocide)

[Chorus : Son Little]
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full

[Verse 2 : Son Little]
See I dont' even got to make a wrong move
What you got to do to put yourself in my shoes
Don't tell yourself such a terrible lie
It's time for you to walk in the light
('cause everybody knows what's a genocide)
But I ain't picking side, picking side

[Chorus : Son Little]
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full

[Bridge : Xenia Rubinos]
What you expected, what you expected
Why you're an expecter
Why you, why you no respect it
Why always expect it

[Chorus : Son Little]
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full
What are you waiting for? Give me a flicker of a sign
Coming like raging bull, expecting to be paid in full

Tom and bobby, They gone, They don’t live here long
But i’m still knocking and clawing. Wishing gonna get me none
All or nothing. Get on. Bang the guns bang these drums
Come in hungry. You gone. Left us with none but crumbs

[Chorus 1]
Out in the fields, we’re the same
Out here, my dear, ain’t nothin changed
Cross my heart

[Verse 2]
For love, for money, for what? Trying to sell hot to the sun
Sex and candy, so young, bet i’m gonna get me some
Rum and honey, you run, run till your heart feel numb
Come, i’m hungry, You gone, left us to scrap for crumbs

[Chorus 2]
Out in the fields, we’re the same
Bad deal, flash steel, get locked in cage
Well, ain’t we brave, feel my rage
Cross my heart, Nothing changed
All I want Is no more pain
Cross my heart

[Verse 1]
Call me crazy, when I see you baby
Got a smile about you, something red wine about you
In the evening hazy, in a summer dress you slay me
With one smile you got me, out gen pop acting sloppy

[Chorus 1]
Mad about you
Breaking my heart at the first sight
Leaving me lost in the morning light
I'm mad about you
Breaking my heart at the first sight
Leave me alone

[Verse 2]
How you call me, call me
How you crawl all on me
But now you say it's different baby
After I took you to the river baby
Though my memory's hazy
Flowing in a summer dress, you slay me
Well, how'd it happened baby
Our first date was lasting baby

[Bridge]
O no
And then she's gone
And I'm a rolling stone, up in the cloud porn
O no
And then she's gone
And I'm a rolling stone, up in the cloud born porn

[Chorus 2]
O no
Breaking my heart at the first sight
Leaving me lost in the morning light
I'm mad about you
Breaking my heart at the first sight
Leaving me lost in the morning light

I'm mad about you
Breaking my heart at the first sight
Leaving me lost in the morning light
I'm mad about you
Breaking my heart at the first sight
Leaving me lost

Come on now baby let me explain myself
Spoonful or two of you is good for my health

Well I fear I may have overslept my bounds
I probably should resume my rounds
Now Dr. Feelgood's back in town

[Verse 2]
You seem to think that I’m backsliding
This twisted road just keeps on winding

[Chorus]
Well I fear I may have overslept my bounds
I probably should resume my rounds
Now Dr. Feelgood's back in town

[Verse 3]
Way down below these feet are crying
This horny goat just keeps on whining

[Chorus]
Well I fear I may have overslept my bounds
I probably should resume my rounds
Now Dr. Feelgood's back in town

[Verse 1]
Sing a call to a morning dove
Over the prairie, through the hills
I hear it still in the singing of the bread
From your lips which splashed my dull house
With music

[Chorus 1]
I went out walking in the wood
By a river which never sleeps
All I bare, all I sieve
I thought of you so presently

[Verse 2]
I dreamt of the warmest days of love
Which knew not sorrow nor betrayal
When truth was will in the singing of the gale
But when I lay in a verdant field
None could stay my rising

[Chorus 2]
I went out walking in the wood
And the light casts long from the moon
And life is short as a breath half-taken
I could not wait to tell you the truth

[Post-Chorus]
I have been waiting on you

[Outro]

"
155254,"

[Verse 1]
Follow my voice
I am right here
Beyond this light
Beyond all fear

[Chorus]
The clouds are passing by on by, my darling
Your eyes are breathing
I've seen them in the light

[Verse 2]
I consciously died
I've seen dew on a rose
I've seen a double rainbow
I got a complicated soul
To me, this city's hell
But I know you call it home
I was made for the green
Made to be alone

[Chorus]
The clouds are passing by on by, my darling
Your eyes are breathing
I've seen them in the light

[Post-Chorus]
And I couldn't let it go
No matter how hard I was trying
The clouds are passing by

[Verse 3]
I've been called heartbreaker
For doing justice to my own
I, too, been a fault-finder
But that life is broke
How I love you
You're the one my heart chose
And so I will be here
And so I will be here

[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond this light
Beyond all fear
Beyond this love
Beyond all fear

[Chorus]
The clouds are passing by on by, my dear
Your eyes are breathing
I've seen them in the light

"
155255,"

[Verse 1]
I lived my life alone before you
And with those that I'd never succeeded to love
And I grew so accustomed to that kind of solitude
I fought you, I did not know how to give it up

[Verse 2]
Before you, had I ever known love
Or had I only known misuse of the power another had over me?
The power another had over me

[Verse 3]
I crossed the country and I carried no key
Couldn't I look up at the stars from anywhere?
And sometimes I did, I felt ancient
But still I sought peace and it never came to me

[Verse 4]
They often spoke as though I had been set free
But I traveled only in service of my dreams
I stood before them all, I was a sleepwalker

[Verse 5]
Couldn't hold my misery down
Not even for you
It bore me on all the places I've ever gone
And I grew so accustomed to that kind of solitude
But I long for you now
Even when you just leave the room

[Verse 6]
And of all the roads and the cities that I passed through
And of all the eyes I have searched inside
The one sense of permanence that I came to feel was mine
Only beneath your gaze

"
155256,"

[Verse 1]
Paper that's quick to burn, and the cinnamon peeler
Beetles crushed that dye the carmine, well, I exist to be dreaming still
Kansas, Arkansas, my fields they're always rich and in fire
Long work labor not worth our minds
And I long forgotten the feeling of silence

[Chorus 1]
And if the roses need not tending
Until, until noon I'd sleep
Never could I have gone on that way
Because money's not the thing that's ever given me sight

[Verse 2]
Colorado, Wyoming, Helena into the Evergreen
And the wilds washed all thought of endeavor that was left in me

[Chorus 2]
And would you ask my permission
The next time you absorb me?
Preserve my memory of the mystic west
As I lay no claim to the devotion I felt

[Verse 3]
Our conversation, it banks in me
And I had almost forgotten the nature of dawn
I thought of it for days after, even months after the moments were gone

[Chorus 3]
But I'd get so lonely inside that room
No matter who would ever wait for me
I get so lonely inside that room
No matter who would ever wait for me

"
155257,
155258,"

[Verse 1]
Back on tour
Driving through southwestern towns
That I had been in before
Sun split ember, and fields that span
Forever, forever
Forever

[Chorus]
And when I first saw you
The sky, it was such a natural blue
The sky, it was such a natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue

[Verse 2]
Stars over a back porch
They're talking but I, I don't say much anymore
It's old news but if you're asking
Been a long time since I...
Since I've been moved

[Chorus]
But when I first saw you
That feeling, it came over me too
That feeling, it came over me too
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue

[Verse 3]
Chicory burns grass at your knees
Walk forward from your open wound
Live in dreams, I'll remain forever
Inside the colors you've shown...
You've shown to me

[Chorus]
And when I first saw you
The sky, it was such a natural blue
The sky, it was such a natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
