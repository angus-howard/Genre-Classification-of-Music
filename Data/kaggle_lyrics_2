6439,"Let's get up, let's get down
Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

The rap era's outta control, brother's sellin' their soul
To go gold, going, going, gone, another rapper sold
(To who) To pop and R&B, not the MD
I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin' on they fans, they ill
Trying to chill, saying ""damn, it be great to sell a mill""
Thats when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

(So whatcha sayin) You wanna go pop goes the weasel
You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diesel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MCs duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me
(Hit Squad) yea, P, hit me

Another megablast funky dope style from cross yonder
(So help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda)
(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say there's no business like show business
But if this the truth, please explain why is this
Rappers been around long, makin' mad noise you see
Still I haven't seen one rapper livin' comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover
I stick to underground, keep the crossover"
6440,"Slow down baby

Cause you can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown boy, you must be loc' on sess
Cause many often wonder is M.D. paid
You're God damn right punk, stay outta my way
Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke MC's
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
A rapper suffered from bleedin, sprains and slit throats
Cause my style, deadly psychopath schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
Cause I clock pesos, don't sell llello
'Nother word for cocaine mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk, with beats that thump
For speakers and amps, cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin my headlights are blinkin
Brothers ridin my tip L, at the same time thinkin DAMN
How could a brother be so nice?
Cause I'm the capital, P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite
And while you was bangin on tables;
I was bangin Snow White P!

Slow down baby

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian'
Playing MC's like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throat
Tryin to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MC's become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty - face down on the pavement!
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real God
The undertaker, droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin punks a whippin' (aww shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the huh forget it I'm constipated L!

Slow down baby

When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any whack MC that flexes, I'm creamin' him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin'
I'm unique, fatigued at my peak you still seek
A style cause yours extra weak
New method, to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick, like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

Slow down baby"

[Erick Sermon]
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, ""richter scale""
It goes lights, camera, action I'm on
One more time to kill em, my rap flow is fulfilling
I scream with the beastie boys, what time is it?
It's two o'clock, you gettin knocked out the box
Then kicked off the block, def squad hit squad
No we won't stop, fuck it call the cops (uh-huh)
I be the invincible, in the school of hard knocks
I'm the principle, Fatman Joe ya know

[Parrish Smith]
As you suffer the repercussions, coming through the blaze
Bust the crime scene, cause some drama, niggas ducking
When we come through, throwing the jab, in the one-two
Laying MC's out to trap, when we run through (like what? )
Like the marathon, flooded with the diamonds on
Get my rhyming on, PMD fucking shining on
Back to biz, new address with the fat crib
My shit in the wiz, poli'-in with the big wigs

[Chorus Erick Sermon: x2]
Off the meter, and every time we reach the
Tip-top and ya don't stop
In the field of rap, we pull rank no question
We top the ""richter scale""

[Erick Sermon]
Bust the techniques, e.d. fantastic
Unreal gangster shit, mass appeal
Rap's top dog, I'm the one you call on
To get sic'-with-it, e don't forget it
I'm six, two and a half, heavyset, chocolate brown
Hell of a jab, gift to gab
I'm the elite, keep it underground like street level
I rock a Rolex watch, with a diamond bezel

[Parrish Smith]
Rap terror terror, EPMD, a new era
Off the Richter scale, blowing hotter than ever
With the squadron, beg your pardon, got the heads nodding
Lost your mind and said, ""shit!!"" when we barged in
The front door door, rugged, keeps our shit raw raw
Make hits for the fans, plus the world tour
Believe that, peep that e and p's back
Wrecking heads daily, so chill and get the bozack

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
Yo royal flush-in, all my cats be busting
Serving you customers and those fake hustlers
Whats up? step to me, I smack you silly
I'm the kid, but no comparison to billy
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers, can't you tell?
Girls lose to me when they groove to Maxwell, 
I got one life to live so I'm living
Got girls to be hitting more cars to be driving

[Parrish Smith]
We stripped too many beats to make too many niggas to break
No moves are fake, no warning shots fired blasting on crews like corrupt jakes
The black viper, scream on MC's and rhyme ciphers
More dangerous mind than, Michelle Pfeiffer
So skedaddle-daddle, you get rattled don't wanna battle-battle
Put one to your rhyme saddle, stompin through, like wild cattle
We flow beef so dead that, let that shit cease
I'm quick with the hands, plus accurate with the two-piece

But I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

I don't know why I'm stayin' with you
If everything they're sayin' is true
I heard about you lyin' to your mama, baby
And I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

Words don't hardly even matter
When nothin' seems to satisfy your mind
Trust is ready to find
Do you think you can make it to tomorrow

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then I'll know what to do about you
As always my wanderin' mind
Takes me right down
To the bottom of the basement

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then I'll know what to do about you
Whenever you decide what you're wantin' baby
Then I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

Plans don't hardly even matter
When everybody's messin' with your mind
Love is ready to find
Do you think you can make it to tomorrow

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then I'll know what to do about you

Takes me right down
To the bottom of the basement
I'm wanderin', I'm a wanderin' child
Goin' right down

I made myself break free
Of the anchor keeping me
Safe and sound in sanity,
Safe inside my old routine.

I am far from land.
I have left in my hand
A few grains of sand,
And I try to understand
The world in all its expanse.

Alone again, I hope to find
A greater kindness, peace of mind,
A faith, a joy in my core.
I leave my love on familiar shores.

I am deep at sea.
The waves roll over me.
Tossed among eternity,
I am as much as everything.
I am good for nothing.

Alone again, I hope to find
A greater kindness, peace of mind,
A faith, a joy in my core.
I head for some unknown shore.

I am deep at sea.
I am swimming. I am free.
A great love envelops me.
I feel a part of something.
This life, it is for living.

The truth is growing stronger.
My youth is getting farther.

I am deep at sea."
7711,"I've been looking for a way out
Of this crazy situation now
The world in crisis; seems like paradise 
Was lost and won't be found
And all of life is endangered 
And on the verge of breaking down.

I wake up all fear and dread-locked
By all the things I cannot talk about.
We built our house of cards on ignorance, 
A landfill of deceit. The walls are hollow 
And we listen, worry what they will secrete.

Woe woe woe woe is we.

We all know they've got it fixed 
In politico-economics.
We're junking bonds; we're dropping 
Bombs we've made by guzzling gasoline.
Public confidence is shaken 
Like the apple from the tree.

Namu Amida Butsu, gomen.
Forgive me for my trespasses.
I do my best to exist east of Eden, 
West of garbagetown, over-accumulated 
Karma. Armageddon, full meltdown.

Woe woe woe woe is me.

I've been looking for a way out
Of this crazy situation now
Our world in crisis; seems like paradise 
Was lost and won't be found
And both our lives are endangered 
And on the verge of breaking down.

Woe woe woe woe is we.

Then the garden gates swing wide, 
And we enter paradise.
We are angels; we are good. 
We open our wings; we've understood 
How time and change are fine,
They're the way. They're the way"
7712,"My room is white, the walls 
And all my appliances, all compliances.
I live in silence, my windows 
Closed to traffic, all that racket.

Into your apartment.

Are we going to give up or (are) we going to try?
Are we going to give up or (are) we going to try to learn what life is?

The tide comes in, and we're caught 
By the rocks and the wetness neverendless.
We kiss for the first time, our lips and tongues 
Tied in fitness, infiniteness. 
Then the ocean pulls back somehow, 
To reveal a crowd of uncertainty.

Are we going to live up to the words we said?
Are we going to live up to love we made? Made? Made?

A house, a garden, a family tree, 
Fruit aplenty, all varieties.
Desire fulfilled, inspired until 
The awakening from our daydreaming.
Here in reality, what we make believe
We can make happen.

Are we going to give up or are we going to try?
Are we going to live up or are we going to die tonight? 

Are we going to give up or are we going to try?
Are we going to give up or are we going to try to learn what life is?"

I gave you my hope.
The walls, they surround us,
Unbound us. We are one.

Is here in my kitchen.
Soup is on.

Lover, lover.
Come on over.

You gave me your home.
You gave me your hope,
Built us an altar
Of bronze and redwood timber.
The stairs are done.

You gave me your heart.
You gave me your art,
Drawings and flowers
And so many hours.
Night has come.

Lover, lover
Roll on over.

Took turns at the sink.
We crawl back into bed.
There are eggs for an omelette,
If you're hungry.

Place it in a jar
I'll collect it when I die
Sliding from a star
And down though the clouds

Strip away the mystery
Lash out at the night
I can change the story line
But cannot make it right
But I'll try

The words come drifting by
But I could reply
Punching holes in the sky
Punching holes in the sky

You don't have to feel afraid
The rage is all for show
I can always draw the line
But sometimes it's so hard to know

Words come drifting by
But I cannot reply
Punching holes in the sky
Punching holes in the sky

Words come drifting by
But I cannot reply
Punching holes in the sky
Punching holes in the sky

Understand my sickness
Know the things I know

Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Tell me that you hate me
Make me unaware

You were the queen of quite a few

And I was there, but you didn't care

I didn't matter somehow.

 

The band played and you sang a tune

And the stars fell down from the moon

And you smiled a smile that parted the sea

But you didn't notice me

No.

 

Your eyes filled up the sky and they were blue

And you had a weird monkey there with you too

And you danced a jig and tipped his hat

And you turned around with a grin so fat

And he was me.

 

There were lights and fireworks and cannons going off in your honor

And I was worried,

But a man said “Don't worry, nothing can harm her”

And I grabbed the microphone and I stood all alone

And I looked up at you, and you looked down at me

And then you said “Off with his head”.

 

I had a dream about you"

True love will find you in the end

Only if you're looking can it find you
'Cause true love is searching too

Unless you step out into the light?
Don't be sad I know you will

I'm stemmed and mapped
You're cut away

How will we raise or fall or will we try?
I'm halfway pleased to meet you
I'm halfway pleased to meet you

You're shrunk and left
I'm staid and grown
You're boxed and down
I stand alone

My darling, I'm so in love with you
I guess you know you left me speechless when you broke the news
Everything went round and round

How I wish days like those 12 would last forever

Ma and Pa aren't too happy about it
But it's harder on them, for I'll be leaving

I hope that soon, my darling
God will make all our dreams come true

I've started to take a long, hard look at all my surroundings
And at all the people I'm so crazy about
It's going to be harder than I thought leaving all this behind

I love you, can't stand being away from you
I love you

Now remember, darling
I've been here all my life
But with my Joe at my side
I won't be able to complain

Let it send you off to sleep
Come inside, there's nothing left to shock you
Now you've landed on your feet

Then after all the fun is over
You will still have all the memories
Come alive and see the world through all the trees

Come alive, you know it's more than breathing
Have to wrestle with your soul
Show it that you're close to understanding
Don't give up and think you're too old

Feel the change rising up inside you
See the fear scare itself away
Find a road leading back to your life
Come alive, give the rest away
Come alive, give the rest away

29817,"By the shattered coils of another's arms
And swept inside like the rains that weep
That fell away when your girlish charms
Cried out to take on motherhood
She waits by the windowsill
All wrapped in white and puzzling
What happened to the child inside
Who ran the streets in the days at night

She says nothing seems the same
And I can't change a thing
Her body's like a wave
Breaking to the sea
She says everything seems strange
Locked behind the years
But life is ours to find
In the days at night

There passes a stranger every eve
Who walks himself on a silver leash
And in his head the world's asleep
Awakens in his hands believed
When he was young
He had a dream
To be a star on the movie screen
But now it all seems a silly lie
As he walks alone in the days on fire

He says nothing seems the same
And I can't feel a thing
My body's like a wave
Caving in on me
He says everything seems strange
Holding back the tears
And he smiles just like a child
In the days at night

You'll find the right way to cherish, in dreams,
All of the snow frozen

You'll find a world that's so perfect and cold

A part of me you hold

Littering in the cupboards
Like some pieces of the puzzle
A nest just like a mother
The dampness of your sweater

It's never put together
As I watched you from the window
Behind the curtains you turned
Slowly as a teacher
Wrap around you tightly
This love is built in metal
Fall around in shadows

It's never put together
It's never put together
Behind the curtains you turned
Fall slowly as a feather

That you've been talking about.
Dreaming of the South
And all those lost goodbyes,
And all those lonely tears,
You never got to cry

It never works out right,
Unless you're one to follow.
Where the silence takes too long,
When the night falls
When the night falls oh so slow,
And caution isn't ours.
When the night falls
When the night falls oh so low,
We may lose control.

I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about.
Dreaming of the South
And all those lonely nights,
And all those lost goodbyes,
You never got to sigh.

I want to be the one to help you find those dreams
Because you've been hanging around,
Talking about the South,
And all those balmy nights,
And all those lonely songs,
You never got to write.

29820,"A loose, and hazy time
When you were not my Clementine
And I was not your diamond's eye

For our love was not lost in style
You were strong, I was a child

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

And Love, has died in song
Carried down by ancient tongues
Ferried around the water's thrum
And winds, along a line
Along a whirl, a lonely girl

To be, to see, to sweat, and bleed
To fall on your sword-on your sword
On your word

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

Be still, by my side
For you are not my Clementine
And I am not your diamond's eye
To Sleep!

By right of you, I can't endure
In the light of things, I can't ignore
In spite of all the rose's thorns, and hopeless works

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here,
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers

Waking cross the river, river of delusion

Around this dance of death

Broken heart

One goes where the water flows and water's running dry

Just close our eyes
Pretend we forget
North country dreams
Twist this dance of death

33542,"There are code breakers with lines well tapped
Traces sweeping out across the static night
You are draped in white like the blossoms of the tree
Looking down a glass elevator
At your father signing the papers for
Two silver trees, two silver trees
Two worlds in need, two silver trees

[Chorus]
Branches falling down
From sources underground
False identities
Stranded in each single seed

False sense of warning no poisoned cup
Just deception crawling up like a snake
Decay of the blossoms and roots well hacked
Spoil the hidden waters dying at the base of
Two silver trees, two silver trees
Two worlds in need, two silver trees

[Chorus]"
33543,"When the fists of winter fly, driving bones into the snow
Blackened frostbitten nights, vodka running dry
The statues cloaked in white and migrants from museums
Losing all the feeling now that sunrise is outlawed

Strangers plant themselves down in the cold hard ground
Later when the harvest thaws snow drops will be in bloom

Crossed out on city maps, Prospekt Mira reveals
Shadows drinking antifreeze 'neath the underpass
Ordered once a Gulag's march, now cities send the call
Falling from the rooftops fast and frozen against the wall

Where strangers plant themselves, dead souls of the underground
When February thaws snow drops will be in bloom again
Bloom again, bloom again, bloom again, bloom again
Red blooms, red blooms
"
33544,"Wire fences still coiled with flowers of the night
Songs of the birds like hands call the earth to witness
Sever from fear before taking flight

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's hands

Me siento solo why perdido una vela alumbra mi camino
Cruzando tierras que nunca he visto
Cruzando el rio de mi destino
Solo soy un chico mas que suena en alto why mirando al mar

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's hands
Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's hands

33545,"I'm gonna walk these streets of cold concrete
Like I'm a ghost searching for its grave
Then I'll dwell by the edge of this man made lake
And descend into the city that holds no place for me

But the streets with no stir of life
And all the houses on the streets are wholly submerged
Then I'll gather the leaves from the cell phone trees
And return them to their place and pretend someone's calling for me
Someone's calling for me, someone's calling for me

33547,"Felt a tremor stir beneath my breath
That forecasts storms on the gallup poll
Waking up from the nightmare news
Hoping to read a sign in the morning air

Nothing changes here and nothing improves
All say my friends who just want out
And leave these troubles behind
Scatter like paper in the eye of the storm
Documented with a silenced note
That's only heard from far away

More cards in play, following suit
Everywhere you look, you only see red
Wonder when to call off the race
Watching a horse running down its last legs
When you think it couldn't get much worse
The numbers rise on the death toll
And the chimes of freedom flash and fade
Only heard from far, far away

I hear you can't trust in your own
Now the grey is broken in the early morn
And the words forming barely have a voice
It's just your heart that's breaking without choice

Everything you hear is distorted in your head
Bouncing off the walls, unraveling the thread
Staying up with the blue screen glow
Forgetting everything you ever dreamed years ago

When the dread is flowing down my veins
I want to tear it all down and build it up again
Hear your heart that's breaking without choice
I want to hear those chimes ring again
Ring again"

Threaten my life, use me and desert me

Just keep it in mind all the time that you've dedicated

I lose the urban sick, slick violence
On every field of green
There is a silver sheen
That makes me question my own compliance

And when I field the query
I know the answer that I'm gonna give
It's not that one can beat the other in real time
It's just the scenery of how I wanna live"

Atop the sheets but luckily
I left the heater on

And in my dreams I wrote the best
Song that I’ve ever written
Can’t remember how it goes

I stayed drunk and fell awake
I was cycling on a plane
And far away I heard you say you liked me

We drifted to a party, cool
The people went to arty school
They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

[Chorus]
In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name

I found an Ezra Pound
And made a bet that if I found
A cigarette, I’d drop it all and marry you

Just then a song comes on:
""You can’t always get what you want""
The Rolling Stones, oh woe is we, the irony

The stones became the moss
And once all inhibition's lost
The hipsters made a mission to the farm

We drove by tractor there
The yellow straw replaced our hair
We laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name


You said, ""We only live once""
So we touched a little tongue
And instantly I wanted to

I lost my train of thought
And jumped aboard the Epping as
The doors were slowly closing on the world

I touched on and off
And rubbed my arm up against yours
And still the inspector inspected me

The lady in the roof
Was living proof that nothing
Really ever is exactly as it seems

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name


We caught the river boat downstream
And ended up beside a team
Of angry footballers

I fed the ducks some krill
Then we were sucked against our will
Into the welcome doors of the casino

We drank green margaritas
Danced with sweet senoritas
And we all went home as winners of a kind

You said ""I guarantee we'll have more fun
Drink till the moon becomes the sun
And in the taxi home I’ll sing you a Triffids song""

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name"

Radiating charm - a living cloak of luck
It's the only concrete link with an absent friend
It's a symbol I can wear 'till we meet again
Or it's a weight around my neck while the owner's free
Both protector and reminder of mortality
It's a curse - I cannot shirk responsibilities
From the teacher to the pupil it's a gift to me
So I love my leather jacket and I wear it all the time
I love my leather jacket

A thousand colours reflect off your face
The stars surround us as we sail on through our kaleidoscope world

The sounds we make echo on through our kaleidoscope world
Like this...
If we were floating in a space capsule

The mists enfold us gently smelling
Breeze in our ears softly telling
Of the days of light and laughter long ago
They trace us, taste us, touch our hair
Show us a castle and show us to their lair - to their lair
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home.
It's pretty cool but we can't rest
The purple sun sets in the west
We prance on gold - red summer lawns
Dragons-blood evening, the buzz of swarms
Of lawnmowers mowing summer lawns away, far away,
I realise we really are quite far away, far away,
Far away, far away
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones

Counting down lonely hours
Drinking lots and taking showers
I no longer dream about the rest of my years
